Of those who can, it still doesn\u2019t guarantee they\u2019ll get the handbag they want \u2014 especially if that bag is the Herm\u00e8s Birkin. Such is the reason why the legendary house of absolute luxury is being sued by people of means who are livid Herm\u00e8s refuses to accept their money in exchange for the bag. They are pursuing an antitrust class action suit against the company with the end goal, presumably, of finally being able to own a Birkin. Herm\u00e8s first came into my focus in 2012, when another very wealthy individual, LVMH founder, chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, the wealthiest man in the world depending on what week it is, sought to buy the entire company \u2014 not just a Birkin \u2014 using methods even more hostile. The more you dive into the ethos of this legendary luxury brand, the more you realize only Herm\u00e8s could create the most quintessential of first world problems: HNWIs suing because the company wants more from them than simply their money. Herm\u00e8s has a market capitalization of about $240.15 billion, making it the second most valuable luxury brand in the world behind LVMH and the 44th most valuable company across all categories. The luxury house is clearly doing something right to warrant this fanfare. LONDON, ENGLAND - JANUARY 05: Views of the Hermes luxury goods shop on New Bond Street on January ...

Founded in 1837 by Thierry Herm\u00e8s as a harness shop producing high-quality leather riding gear for European aristocrats, leather goods and saddlery still account for about half of the company\u2019s total revenues nearly two centuries later. After the kafuffle with Arnault, the company is now firmly owned by descendants of Thierry, ensuring its founding philosophies of quality above quantity and perfection over profits remain absolute.

This house has proved again and again that poetry is not incompatible with business.\u201d When Arnault attempted his hostile takeover, analysts questioned why the Herm\u00e8s family didn\u2019t just give in to the pursuit. After all, Arnault didn\u2019t become one of the richest men in the world by not knowing how to do business well. Yet Arnault\u2019s reputation is for cost cutting at every corner. While Arnault would certainly have retained his billionaire status with an Herm\u00e8s acquisition, very few would have benefitted. Particularly since Arnault is known for ending existing manufacturing operations for his new acquisitions and finding less costly production outside of France \u2014 where Herm\u00e8s produces all of its silks and leather goods, including The Birkin. LVMH\u2019s Christian Dior is currently being investigated for outsourcing production to Italian-based Chinese-owned firms known to exploit workers.

Those lucky enough to be accepted into the company\u2019s highly competitive apprenticeship program become part of a humanistic culture. To ensure a personalized, close-knit working environment, no more than 250 employees are staffed at any of Herm\u00e8s\u2019 31 France-based manufacturing facilities. Each facility is intentionally constructed to be bright, well-lit and furnished with ergonomically designed workstations. For their dedication to meeting the company\u2019s strict quality standards, employees receive profit-sharing, stock options and other incentives in addition to their already competitive salaries. Employees thus have ownership in the company, which is reflected in the pride they take in their work, and subsequently, the perfection found in Herm\u00e8s products. Few leave the company, with employment tenures well into decades. But those that do find themselves in high demand. One doesn\u2019t leave Herm\u00e8s without mastering their craft, enduring many years of training across several categories to develop an exquisite eye for detail. \u201cHerm\u00e8s does not consider itself to be a luxury-goods company. Herm\u00e8s is a company of creative craftsmen,\u201d Thomas told journalist Lucia van der Post in an interview. \u201cOur philosophy is focused on creativity and craftsmanship. Of course, Herm\u00e8s likes to make a profit but first comes our desire to make the best object that we can and then profit is the reward for a job well done.\u201d An employee works in the new leather goods workshop of French high fashion luxury goods manufacturer ...

Every object is made by one person, from beginning to end, over a minimum of 18 hours. Every handbag is signed by the artisan who made it as a guarantee to the customer they now own a carefully fashioned objet d'art. The crocodile Birkin, in particular, is produced only with supple leather found from a crocodile\u2019s underbelly. The umbilical scar at the center of that belly is strategically placed in front of the bag during construction as a mark of authenticity and excellence. From Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the general artistic director of Herm\u00e8s, in the same interview with Van der Post, \u201cWe are not in the business of selling large numbers of the same product at a high price. Our business model is focused on the quality of each object, not on the quantity. The problem is that this model is not compatible with the expectations of a large financial conglomerate. Our time frame is completely different. We are innovative artisans, constantly evolving to meet modern needs, but nevertheless we stick to the founding family\u2019s principles of wanting to make the day-to-day objects that our customers use as beautifully and perfectly as we can. But to do this we need to do things much more slowly. We do want to be profitable, but profit is not the driving force. It is the reward.\u201d NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 04: A Herm\u00e8s matte white Himalayan Niloticus crocodile Birkin 35 with ...

(Photo by Cindy Ord/Getty Images) Getty Images It\u2019s Really About Relationships But back to the Birkin lawsuit. The Birkin bag has a storied history, first conceived in 1984 as an impromptu sketch on an Air France vomit bag by actress Jane Birkin and Herm\u00e8s then-Chief Executive, Jean-Louis Dumas, during a serendipitous mid-air meeting. Originally priced at $2,000, it wouldn\u2019t reach the status of becoming the handsome handbag that, metaphorically, launched a thousand lawsuits until the 2008-09 financial crisis. According to Matthew Rubinger, chief commercial officer for the online marketplace 1stDibs, during the financial crunch, the Birkin became the perfect alternative asset for the well-heeled in need of quick cash. In his former roles at Heritage Auctions and Christie\u2019s, Rubinger created handbag divisions where multiple Birkin bags, including the rare Himalaya Nile crocodile Birkin, auctioned for well over $100,000. The crux of the Birkin lawsuit alleges Herm\u00e8s requires customers to buy other products before finally given a chance to buy a Birkin, an act of unlawful \u201ctying\u201d under Section 2 of the federal Sherman Act and California's Cartwright Act. Herm\u00e8s, allegedly, is using the lure of owning a Birkin to \u201ccoerce\u201d customers to buy other Herm\u00e8s products. Per Holland & Knight, \u201cThe named plaintiffs include two individuals \u2013 one of whom was allegedly not permitted to purchase a Birkin bag because he had not purchased other products, and another who had spent tens of thousands of dollars on Herm\u00e8s products, including Birkin bags, but was allegedly told that only \u2018clients who have been consistent in supporting our business\u2019 were eligible to make the purchase.\u201d A Bonhams member of staff with a selection of sixty-four Hermes bags from a private collection, ...

(Photo by Rebecca Naden/PA Images via Getty Images) PA Images via Getty Images But perhaps the likelier argument is that Herm\u00e8s focuses on building healthy relationships with their customers \u2014 first by thoroughly training and treating well the employees who are then, second, charged with creating products of absolute perfection to, third, the delight of the end consumer. The Birkin, after all, can only be made in limited quantities because of its extensive production process. It\u2019s just not possible to offer a Birkin to everyone who wants one, despite how deep their pockets run. I\u2019d argue that Herm\u00e8s rewards loyal customers by putting them in que to own their most in demand, yet limited, product. Given Herm\u00e8s\u2019 market cap, one can only imagine just how long that line is. Herm\u00e8s is perpetually on my radar simply because they\u2019ve mastered the luxury consumers\u2019 passionate pursuit of luxury. How else can you explain why customers want a limited production Herm\u00e8s product so badly, they\u2019ve turned to the courts to try to force the company to sell them one? Take note, CMOs! There\u2019s gold in Herm\u00e8s\u2019 playbook. In the meantime, a judge will decide who has the right to buy a Birkin. Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website.

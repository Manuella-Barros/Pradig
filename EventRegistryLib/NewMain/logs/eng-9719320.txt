(AP) -- North Carolina's elections board certified unanimously on Tuesday a right-leaning political party to field candidates this fall in the state, but again deferred final action for two organizations that collected signatures to help get Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West on the presidential ballot.\n\nThe Constitution Party of North Carolina will join several other parties already officially recognized by the state. Board staff determined the party collected enough valid signatures from registered and qualified voters to exceed a threshold set in state law. The Constitution Party had been an official party in 2020, but it failed to perform well enough in that election to remain one.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the State Board of Elections voted 3-2 against a motion giving the Constitution Party formal recognition, citing concern about the mailing address for the group's chairman on signature collection documents. The board's Democratic majority made up the prevailing side. But board Chair Alan Hirsch said before Tuesday's 5-0 vote that the issue was very technical in nature. \"I am of the view that on reflection that we shouldn't stand in the way for any potential technical errors,\" Hirsch said.\n\nThe Democratic majority last month also declined to approve official recognition of the We The People party and Justice for All Party of North Carolina, although board officials confirmed that both petition efforts had turned in more valid signatures than the 13,865 required. That threshold is much larger than what Kennedy, an author and environmental lawyer, and West, a professor and progressive activist, would have needed if they sought to run statewide as independent candidates.\n\nThe board's Democrats said they wanted more information about what petition gatherers for the We The People, backing Kennedy, and Justice for All, aligned with West, told voters about the nascent parties. State law requires that they must communicate the \"purpose and intent\" of the new parties to petition signers. They also wanted board staff to attempt to contact signers who later filled out affidavits asking that their names be removed.\n\nHirsch, a Democrat, said Tuesday more time was needed for staff to take in more details. Responses to several subpoenas issued by the board had not been returned by Tuesday's meeting, board attorney Paul Cox said.\n\nHirsch offered no date for the next meeting but said that \"we will do that promptly in plenty of time to get these folks on the ballot, should they be approved as parties.\"\n\nNorth Carolina political parties have until mid-August to submit their presidential ticket candidate names to the board in time for ballots to be prepared. The national Constitution Party this year nominated anti-abortion activist Randall Terry as its presidential candidate.\n\nAdding presidential candidates raises the stakes about who will win North Carolina's 16 electoral votes. Republican Donald Trump won the state in both 2016 and in 2020, but his margin over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 was less than 1.4 percentage points.\n\nRepublican board members expressed frustration Tuesday with another delay, saying the board should stop second-guessing voters who signed the petitions and what signature collectors expressed about their party's purpose and give official recognition. The state Democratic Party and Clear Choice Action, a group affiliated with a super PAC aligned with Biden's allies, wrote the board last month asking that the petitions be rejected.\n\n\"I'm just completely at a loss of what's going on here,\" GOP board member Kevin Lewis told Hirsch, adding that the deferrals are \"bringing a lot of bad publicity on the board. Your motives are starting to be questioned.\"\n\nHirsch declined to respond directly to Lewis' allegations of partisanship. He said later: \"We're gonna take the evidence where it leads us.\"\n\nRepublican politicians, including Trump's campaign, have also blasted the board's delay as politically motivated. \"Democratic partisans on the State Board of Elections have ignored clear state law and refused to certify third parties that pose a threat to Joe Biden in November,\" state House Speaker Tim Moore said after Tuesday's meeting.\n\nNot including North Carolina, Kennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in 10 states and has submitted signatures in 11 more states. The West campaign said it has secured ballot access in eight states, but acknowledged some certifications must still be finalized.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel)\n\nDespite pressure from Republicans in Washington, the state Board of Elections again put off a decision that would allow well-known third-party presidential candidates on North Carolina's ballot while it investigates petitions asking to form their political parties.\n\nThe state Board on Tuesday delayed certifying Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s We the People Party and Cornel West's Justice for All Party.\n\nLast month, the board voted 3-2 along party lines to defer a final vote to certify those parties, which would allow Kennedy and West to appear on the November ballot.\n\nThe Board certified the Constitution Party Tuesday after the delay from its June meeting. In addition to a presidential candidate, state Board lawyer Paul Cox said the Constitution Party will have candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, and three other candidates who don't yet want their names disclosed.\n\nThe state Democratic Party and a Democratic-aligned super PAC Clear Choice Action have objected to the Board recognizing We the People and Justice for All.\n\nPolls have shown that third party candidates weaken support for President Joe Biden.\n\nRepublican Congressmen Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Bryan Steil, chairman of the House Committee on Administration, sent a letter to Elections Board Chairman Alan Hirsch and Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell last week saying it appeared the board is bowing to pressure from Democrats to deny the parties recognition, Raleigh's News & Observer reported. The congressmen requested documents and information connected to the decision.\n\nQuestions about We the People have centered on what those who signed the petition were told about its purpose and whether We the People is a real political party or simply a vehicle to drive Kennedy's name onto the ballot without his having to gather more than 83,000 signatures as required of independent presidential candidates.\n\nIt's easier to become a political party in North Carolina. Signatures of only 13,865 registered voters are required for party recognition.\n\nElections board staff has subpoenaed nine parties involved in petition signature gathering. They're attempting to contact people who have said they want their names removed from petitions to find out what they were told about their purposes.\n\nThe state board staff has not been able to talk to most of the petition signers they wanted to reach and has not heard from all the subpoenaed parties.\n\nRepublicans on the board pressed for a vote to certify We the People and Justice for All.\n\n\"I'm just completely at a loss as to what's going on here,\" said Kevin Lewis, one of the Republican members. \"I'm disappointed in how the board is dragging its feet on this issue.\"\n\nHirsch said the Board needed more information and would make a decision in plenty of time for candidates to get on the ballot.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_(petitioning_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "We the People (petitioning system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Constitution Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The board's Democratic majority made up the prevailing side. But board Chair Alan Hirsch said before Tuesday's 5-0 vote that the issue was very technical in nature. \"I am of the view that on reflection that we shouldn't stand in the way for any potential technical errors,\" Hirsch said.\n\nThe Democratic majority last month also declined to approve official recognition of the We The People party and Justice for All Party of North Carolina, although board officials confirmed that both petition efforts had turned in more valid signatures than the 13,865 required. That threshold is much larger than what Kennedy, an author and environmental lawyer, and West, a professor and progressive activist, would have needed if they sought to run statewide as independent candidates.\n\nThe board's Democrats said they wanted more information about what petition gatherers for the We The People, backing Kennedy, and Justice for All, aligned with West, told voters about the nascent parties. State law requires that they must communicate the \"purpose and intent\" of the new parties to petition signers. They also wanted board staff to attempt to contact signers who later filled out affidavits asking that their names be removed.\n\nHirsch, a Democrat, said Tuesday more time was needed for staff to take in more details. Responses to several subpoenas issued by the board had not been returned by Tuesday's meeting, board attorney Paul Cox said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHirsch offered no date for the next meeting but said that \"we will do that promptly in plenty of time to get these folks on the ballot, should they be approved as parties.\"\n\nNorth Carolina political parties have until mid-August to submit their presidential ticket candidate names to the board in time for ballots to be prepared. The national Constitution Party this year nominated anti-abortion activist Randall Terry as its presidential candidate.\n\nAdding presidential candidates raises the stakes about who will win North Carolina's 16 electoral votes. Republican Donald Trump won the state in both 2016 and in 2020, but his margin over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 was less than 1.4 percentage points.\n\nRepublican board members expressed frustration Tuesday with another delay, saying the board should stop second-guessing voters who signed the petitions and what signature collectors expressed about their party's purpose and give official recognition. The state Democratic Party and Clear Choice Action, a group affiliated with a super PAC aligned with Biden's allies, wrote the board last month asking that the petitions be rejected.\n\n\"I'm just completely at a loss of what's going on here,\" GOP board member Kevin Lewis told Hirsch, adding that the deferrals are \"bringing a lot of bad publicity on the board. Your motives are starting to be questioned.\"\n\nHirsch declined to respond directly to Lewis' allegations of partisanship. He said later: \"We're gonna take the evidence where it leads us.\"\n\nRepublican politicians, including Trump's campaign, have also blasted the board's delay as politically motivated. \"Democratic partisans on the State Board of Elections have ignored clear state law and refused to certify third parties that pose a threat to Joe Biden in November,\" state House Speaker Tim Moore said after Tuesday's meeting.\n\nNot including North Carolina, Kennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in 10 states and has submitted signatures in 11 more states. The West campaign said it has secured ballot access in eight states, but acknowledged some certifications must still be finalized.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The state Democratic Party and Clear Choice Action, a group affiliated with a super PAC aligned with Biden's allies, wrote the board last month asking that the petitions be rejected.\n\n\"I'm just completely at a loss of what's going on here,\" GOP board member Kevin Lewis told Hirsch, adding that the deferrals are \"bringing a lot of bad publicity on the board. Your motives are starting to be questioned.\"\n\nHirsch declined to respond directly to Lewis' allegations of partisanship. He said later: \"We're gonna take the evidence where it leads us.\"\n\nRepublican politicians, including Trump's campaign, have also blasted the board's delay as politically motivated. \"Democratic partisans on the State Board of Elections have ignored clear state law and refused to certify third parties that pose a threat to Joe Biden in November,\" state House Speaker Tim Moore said after Tuesday's meeting.\n\nNot including North Carolina, Kennedy's campaign has said he is officially on the ballot in 10 states and has submitted signatures in 11 more states. The West campaign said it has secured ballot access in eight states, but acknowledged some certifications must still be finalized.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, who are both running for president, remain in limbo.\n\nThe North Carolina State Board of Elections officially certified the Constitution Party on Tuesday in a unanimous vote. However, the board once again deferred action on the \"We the People\" and \"Justice for All\" parties, which are led by Kennedy and West, respectively.\n\n\"I'm a little disappointed and at a loss at how this board is dragging its feet on this issue,\" Republican board member Kevin Lewis said.\n\nLast month, the board's Democratic majority voted against certifying the parties, but said they would revisit the matter after investigating concerns about misleading petition-gatherers and voters who asked for their signatures to be removed.\n\nAt Tuesday's meeting, the board's lawyer said that board Chair Alan Hirsch, a Democrat, authorized subpoenas to nine people and groups involved in the petition processes and the board had not had sufficient time to collect and review the information. He did not set a date for a second vote on certification.\n\nJuly 1 was the statutory deadline for new candidates to file for office. The board's lawyer, however, said he doesn't believe this deadline applies to presidential candidates and that prior court precedent could allow the board to waive it.\n\nA board member noted that the parties could sue the board for ballot access, as the Green Party successfully did in 2022.\n\nRepublicans and independents at the national and state level have decried the board's handling of the parties, suggesting they are seeking to eliminate competitors to President Joe Biden.\n\n\"This board is yet again engaging in blatant partisanship, this time clearly aimed at preserving the political prospects of Democrats, specifically President Joe Biden in this state's General Election,\" NC GOP Chair Jason Simmons said in a letter to board members on Monday.\n\nAt the meeting last month, the board's two Republicans voted in favor of certifying the parties and suggested that the majority was yielding to political pressure from Democratic groups that sought to eliminate challengers to Biden.\n\nPrior to the vote, the North Carolina Democratic Party and a group tied to Biden lobbied the board to vote against certification.\n\nThe group, Clear Choice Action, sent a lengthy letter to the state board alleging that it had found thousands of deficiencies in JFA's petition sheets. Clear Choice also contacted signers of Kennedy's and West's petitions to question them about their decision.\n\nLast week, high-ranking Republicans in Congress requested information from the board regarding its decision to block the third parties.\n\n\"The NCSBE's decision ensures that some otherwise qualified candidates will not garner votes in the November election, which will inevitably influence the election and potentially sway the electoral results,\" said the letter, signed by U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nState lawmakers are also seeking testimony from the board. The North Carolina House Oversight Committee initially sought to question the board at a hearing on Tuesday, but agreed to reschedule after learning that the board would be meeting on that date.\n\nUnder the Dome\n\nGet the latest news about North Carolina politics from The News & Observer's award-winning team.

Hirsch added that any delay was intended only to allow the board staff to do its due diligence in verifying the legitimacy of the groups' petitions and not politically motivated.\n\nOn June 26, representatives of the Constitution Party, We the People Party, and Justice for All Party, appeared before the state elections board in a virtual meeting to answer questions about their petitions for state recognition.\n\nState law requires petitions with enough signatures from registered North Carolina voters to equal at least .25% of voters who cast ballots in the most recent general election for governor. Based on that, the minimum number of valid signatures required for recognition as a party in North Carolina is 13,865.\n\nThe signatures first must be verified by county elections boards before the petitions are passed on to the state board.\n\nDeep-pocketed effort behind blocking recognition\n\nEach petitioning party has met and exceeded that threshold by thousands of signatures, which is why Stacy Eggers, one of two Republicans on the five-member state board, pushed for a vote on recognition of all three groups.\n\n\"I don't see anything here that would cause us, much like the Constitution Party, to say that they're in violation of the requirements for their signature gathering,\" said Eggers before calling for a vote on Justice for All's petition.\n\nAt the June 26 board meeting, the 3-2 party-line vote against recognizing the Constitution Party centered solely on questions around a discrepancy in the residential address for the group's chairman. All indications were those questions would be cleared up quickly and the Constitution Party will gain recognition at the state board's meeting on Tuesday, July 9.\n\nMuch of the controversy swirls around the We the People and Justice for All efforts to gain recognition. We the People's preferred candidate is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. In the case of Justice for All, their presidential candidate is Cornel West.\n\nDemocrats see Kennedy and West as potential spoilers who could take votes away from the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, currently President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Elias Law Group, a well-known Washington, D.C.-based firm associated with Democratic Party causes, has filed objections with the North Carolina elections board opposing recognition for We the People.\n\nThe law firm filed its objections on behalf of Clear Choice Action, a super PAC working to preventing the interference of third-party and independent candidates in this year's presidential race.\n\nIn their letter to the state board, attorneys with the Elias Law Group alleged the We the People Party was formed for the sole purpose of allowing Kennedy to circumvent North Carolina's tighter rules for independent candidates who want to get on the ballot.\n\nThe Elias Law Group also provided affidavits from 26 voters who allegedly signed the We the People petition but have since asked that their signatures be removed.\n\nBallot access for independent candidates much higher\n\nWhile political parties only need 13,865 for recognition, an independent candidate would need signatures from a number of qualified voters that equals at least 1.5% of the number that voted in the most recent race for governor, or, in this case, 83,188 signatures.\n\nIn the petition script used by We the People to sign up voters, Kennedy is referred to as \"an independent.\" But We the People's North Carolina chairwoman, Ceara Foley, clarified what the use of \"independent\" meant in response to questions from the state elections board's Democratic members about what potential petition signers were told about We the People's goals.\n\n\"I think everybody hears that as independent of Republicans and Democrats and that's part of our general purpose,\" said Foley, distinguishing independent from Unaffiliated, which is an official voter registration label in North Carolina.\n\nFoley criticized the campaign by the Elias Law Group and Clear Choice Action to oppose what she characterized as a grassroots effort by We the People.\n\n\"It's a concerted effort with a lot of money behind it,\" Foley said at the June 26 meeting, adding that one of her group's board members called it 'lawfare.'\n\nIn 2022, the state elections board initially denied the Green Party certification over allegations of fraudulent signature gathering but ultimately gave the Greens official recognition.\n\nThe Green Party's efforts also faced opposition and scrutiny from the Elias Law Group.\n\nThe Green Party needed a federal district court to intervene and allow the group to have their candidates added to the North Carolina ballot after a statutory deadline for doing so had passed.\n\nElections board questioned by Congress, state legislators\n\nWhile Democrats on the state elections boards wanted to postpone a vote on certification, GOP members insisted on proceeding because the three groups seeking party recognition had met all the requirements.\n\n\"I'm afraid that you're probably a victim of a political hit job and I'm sorry if we've wasted your time today,\" said Kevin Lewis, one of the Republican board members, addressing Italo Medelius, chairman of North Carolina's chapter of Justice for All. \"But I appreciate your coming and answering our questions honestly and we'll see where it leads.\"\n\nIn his statements to the elections board, Medelius acknowledged that some outside groups helped Justice for All collect petition signatures and that Justice for All could not account for all the tactics used in the petition effort.\n\nLewis went on to say that he was not accusing any members of the state elections board of participating in a \"political hit job\" but was referring to the efforts by the Elias Law Group and Clear Choice Action to prevent recognition.\n\nAs part of its objection to Justice for All's petition, Clear Choice Action cited evidence of a right-wing activist named Scott Presler who collected petition signatures for Justice for All at a pro-Donald Trump rally.\n\nState Elections Board Chairman Alan Hirsch repeatedly assured the petitioning parties that the decision to deny recognition for \"just for now\" so the board could get \"better information\" about the petition campaigns.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Congress and the North Carolina General Assembly have started inquiries into the state elections board's decision to deny recognition of the three petitioning parties.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 -

Kennedy Jr.'s We the People party.\n\nThird-party hopeful RFK Jr. has been petitioning for ballot access in almost all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according to his campaign website, while former president Donald Trump faces felony sentencing in September and President Joe Biden attempts to assuage calls for his stepping down from office.\n\nDuring the state board of elections' June 26 meeting, the five-person board voted to deny We the People ballot access \"for now.\" The three Democratic board members who voted no said the status of the party could change after further investigation into concerns over the validity of petitioners' signatures and what volunteers told signees about the petition.\n\nCalls for Biden to step down: NC governor shows support for President Biden after White House meeting\n\nAdditional presidential third-party candidates Cornel West with the Justice for All party and Randall Terry for the Constitution party were initially denied ballot access by the state board.\n\nThe updated decision will come out past the July 1 deadline to certify petitions, but Democratic chair of the state board Alan Hirsch said if the parties are approved, he believes they will still be able to place candidates on the ballot.\n\nWith the board's investigation pending, there's still a chance We the People could obtain ballot access, and We the People Vice Chair Ryan Rabah said he anticipates a re-vote in his favor.\n\n\"We look forward to the Board reversing that decision very soon,\" Rabah said in an email. \"This is not the first time the Board has exhibited this type of behavior and this pattern and their motives are being scrutinized. These delaying tactics are a barrier to our campaigns and we want to get to the business of helping the people of North Carolina.\"\n\nThe party continued business as usual holding their state convention just days after the initial denial where they nominated RFK Jr. for president, Nicole Shanahan for vice president, Jeff Scott for North Carolina Senate and Mark Ortiz for Rowan County Commissioner, Rabah said in the email.\n\nA party-line vote\n\nDemocratic board of elections members voted no primarily over concerns about how We the People collected signatures. Did volunteers properly inform signees that they were supporting We the People becoming a party, not just RFK Jr., and not just third parties in general, board members wondered in the meeting.\n\nAfter a few signees requested their names be removed from the petition, Hirsch said, it caused pause. He said those few signees could be indicative of a concerning pattern.\n\nNovember election: Could third-party candidate RFK Jr. make a splash in battleground state North Carolina?\n\nCeara Foley, chair of the We the People party who was present at the meeting, clapped back at the assertion, saying she and her staff were properly informing signers.\n\n\"There are a number of different reasons besides not given the purpose and intent of the petition that people could change their mind months later,\" Foley said.\n\nAdditionally, the North Carolina Democratic Party and Elias Law Group for Clear Choice Action, a Democratic PAC, sent letters to the state board calling into question the party hopeful. Clear Choice Action said RFK Jr.'s campaign was \"creating a sham political party\" under We the People to obtain ballot access easier.\n\nThe letter referenced the difference in required signatures for a new party versus an unaffiliated candidate wherein it takes almost 70,000 more signatures to get on the ballot as an unaffiliated candidate than as a party.\n\nTwo Republican board members, Stacy \"Four\" Eggers IV and Kevin N. Lewis, voted to approve the party, both expressing frustration during the meeting.\n\n\"I don't think it's our responsibility to kick this down the road past the statutory deadline, to go out on a hunting expedition\" for people who may want to remove their names from the petition, Lewis said.\n\nConcerns over political motivation\n\nFrom the beginning of RFK Jr.'s endeavors, Democrats in particular took issue with his run, with many saying he would pull votes from Biden, which could hurt him in a close race with Trump.\n\nDemocratic Party chair in Buncombe County Kathie Kline has been outspoken on the issue writing an opinion piece in the Asheville Citizen Times urging voters not to vote for third-party candidates.\n\nLater, Kline said in an interview that she had concerns about how the We the People party garnered signatures, saying she and her team called petitioners to inquire. When speaking to some signees, she said they did not know it would put RFK Jr. on the ballot. It was misleading, she said.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans jumped on the decision, saying it was politically motivated.\n\n\"The State Board of Elections' majority have shown yet again there is no action too outrageous or too radical they won't make to protect Joe Biden and Democrats,\" said North Carolina GOP Communications Director Matt Mercer.", "source": {"uri": "citizen-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Asheville Citizen Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_(petitioning_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "We the People (petitioning system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West remains undetermined after a July 9 meeting of the North Carolina State Board of Elections (NCSBE).\n\nBy unanimous vote, the board officially certified the Constitution Party to run candidates in the state's November general elections, but it delayed action for an unspecified period of time on Mr. Kennedy's We the People party and Mr. West's Justice for All.\n\nThe decision marked the second time in less than a month that the panel did not vote to add We the People and Justice for All to the state general election ballot.\n\nThe July 9 decision allows Mr. Terry's name to appear on North Carolina's general election ballot in November, but the fate of Mr. Kennedy and Mr. West is still uncertain.\n\nNorth Carolina election officials have confirmed that We the People surpassed the minimum of 13,865 valid signatures required to register as a political party for the 2024 general election.\n\nDemocrats on the elections board have cited concerns about how the party represented itself while circulating petitions and gathering signatures.\n\nThe board's chairman, Alan Hirsch, a Democrat, said on June 26 that the three parties requesting certification had likely met the signatures requirements. The delay was intended to give the board enough time to perform due diligence in verifying the petitions.\n\nOn July 9, Mr. Hirsch reiterated that he wanted to give staff members enough time to complete their investigations into the signatures submitted by We the People and Justice for All.\n\nIn a statement to The Epoch Times, NCSBE spokesperson Patrick Gannon said that board staff directed by board members continue to verify whether We the People and Justice for All \"complied with the statutory requirement for prospective parties to communicate the purpose and intent of the new parties to petition signers.\"\n\nThe board will \"meet again soon\" to decide whether to recognize the parties, Mr. Gannon added, noting that \"there is still time\" for the groups to get their candidates on the North Carolina general election ballot if they are certified.\n\nThe two Republicans on the panel voted in favor of the parties on June 26.\n\n\"I'm just completely at a loss for what is going on here,\" Kevin Lewis, a Republican board member, said during the July 9 meeting.\n\nMr. Kennedy's press secretary Stefanie Spear told The Epoch Times on July 9 that the campaign submitted \"double the required signatures\" in North Carolina and \"counties officially validated much more than we need for We the People to gain ballot access.\"\n\nMs. Spear called the Democratic Party's challenge \"frivolous\" and said North Carolina voters will ultimately be able to vote for Mr. Kennedy in the general election.\n\nDemocrats on the board have expressed concerns about how We the People collected signatures. They asked if petition circulators notified signees they were supporting We the People's bid to become a certified party in the state and not just backing Mr. Kennedy and third parties.\n\nMr. Hirsch noted that the board paused the party's certification after a number of signees asked that their names be removed from the petition.\n\nNorth Carolina Republicans criticized the decision, calling it politically motivated.\n\nMr. Kennedy's campaign submitted paperwork to create We the People in January.\n\nThe campaign has said that filing for political party status in certain states reduced the number of signatures required for the candidate to gain ballot access.\n\nIn North Carolina, independent presidential candidates must obtain 83,188 valid signatures instead of 13,865 for political party nominees.\n\nThe Kennedy-Nicole Shanahan ticket is currently on the ballot in 10 states: California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Utah.\n\nThe campaign said it has submitted its signatures in 12 states -- Alaska, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Illinois, and Nevada.\n\nAccording to the campaign, it has gathered enough signatures for ballot access in Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, and New Hampshire.\n\nThe campaign reported that the Kennedy-Shanahan ticket had collected the required signatures for ballot access in 27 states, totaling 363 electoral votes.\n\nEarlier this year, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the creation of a team to counter third-party and independent presidential candidates.\n\nIt hired Lis Smith, a veteran Democrat strategist who managed Pete Buttigieg's unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign, to spearhead an aggressive communication plan to combat Mr. Kennedy, Mr. West, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein.\n\nMr. Kennedy, after announcing he'd run as an independent, told The Epoch Times in October that his campaign suspected organized efforts by both parties to keep him off the ballot.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_(petitioning_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "We the People (petitioning system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Anderson_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Anderson (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cornel West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epoch Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West on the state's ballot after learning that some voters who signed petitions to help the independent presidential hopefuls gain ballot access did not understand the purpose of those petitions.\n\nThe findings potentially lend credence to some of the objections filed by allies of President Joe Biden seeking to block access for the two candidates in the key battleground state.\n\nAt a North Carolina State Board of Elections hearing on Tuesday, board staff shared that they had reached out to voters who signed petitions to help the minor parties established by Kennedy and West to gain ballot access in the state and found that some of them \"were not told the purpose and intent or did not understand the purpose and intent\" of the petitions they signed.\n\nIn its objections to both Kennedy and West's ballot access, the pro-Biden super PAC Clear Choice claimed that both candidates were \"misleading\" voters who signed their petitions, arguing that the candidates had violated a state law that requires newly formed political parties to inform signers of the \"general purpose and intent\" of the party.\n\nAn elections board staff member reached out to 26 voters who signed the Kennedy campaign's petition to get his We The People party on the ballot and 66 people who signed the West campaign's petition to help his Justice For All party qualify.\n\nWest's campaign submitted over 17,000 validated signatures, while Kennedy's campaign submitted over 18,500 validated signatures. Minor parties must submit at least 13,000 valid signatures to be considered for approval by North Carolina's elections board.\n\nBoard staff also spoke to 12 North Carolina voters who said they did not recall signing petitions to help West qualify for the state's ballot. None of the Kennedy petition signatories recalled not supporting his ballot access, staff said.\n\nThe elections board did not take action Tuesday, with board chair Alan Hirsch saying that staffers were still reviewing materials submitted during the petition process for both minor parties.\n\nTuesday's brief meeting revealed partisan tensions on the five-seat board, which features three Democrats and two Republicans. The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee criticized the board for delaying a ruling at a hearing last month.\n\nFollowing last month's hearing, a conservative-aligned group called Fair Election Fund launched an ad campaign targeting the Democratic members of the board for \"blocking Biden's competition from the ballot.\"\n\nKevin Lewis, a Republican elections board member, suggested Tuesday that the board had an ulterior reason for delaying a ruling, saying, \"Your motives are being questioned.\"\n\nDemocratic board member Siobhan O'Duffy Millen criticized the attacks on the board, citing the Fair Election Fund ads.\n\n\"Some of the rhetoric is a little bit out of hand,\" O'Duffy Millen said. \"Some of these ads that are very personal are unfortunate.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kennedy has qualified for Minnesota's presidential ballot, a state elections official told CNN on Tuesday. He's also qualified in Michigan, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Delaware, California, Hawaii and Utah - making him eligible to compete for 110 electoral votes in total. The Kennedy campaign has either gained ballot access, submitted paperwork or completed signature collecting in 27 states so far.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_pellish@cnn.com", "name": "Aaron Pellish", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornel_West", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cornel West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy Jr. would run under, and Justice for All, the party Cornel West would run under.\n\nAfter initially denying three third parties ballot access at the end of June, the North Carolina State Board of Elections certified one and postponed the rest barring more investigation during a July 9 meeting.\n\nThe June decision to investigate the parties came after receiving letters from the North Carolina Democratic Party and Clear Choice Action, a Democratic PAC, and concerns over whether signees were properly informed on the intent of the party.\n\nThe board's investigation included subpoenaing petition gathering services, presidential candidates associated with the parties and calling signees.\n\nDive into the details: RFK Jr.'s We the People party nominates NC candidates after denial by board of elections\n\nAll We the People signees contacted said they signed the petition; however, the nine contacted signees expressed a mix of responses as to what the petition meant. The board called 26 signers of We the People, and could not reach 17, said Lindsey Wakely, a board of elections staff member.\n\n\"A number of those we spoke with said they were not told the purpose and intent or did not understand the purpose and intent,\" Wakely said about some We the People and Justice for All signees. \"In terms of what it was they thought they were signing, the results were very mixed.\"\n\nTwelve people called from the Justice for All party petition said they \"either did not sign or do not recall signing the petitions,\" according to Wakely.\n\nIn response to the evidence provided, Republican board member Stacy \"Four\" Eggers IV, who voted to certify the parties in the last meeting, called into question the board's motives.\n\n\"We generally do not second guess voters on their decisions and should not do so in this case,\" Eggers IV said, adding that the parties have more than enough signatures necessary for approval.\n\nKevin N. Lewis, the only other Republican member, said the \"board is dragging its feet\" and their actions were creating \"bad publicity\" and added that \"motives are starting to be questioned.\"\n\nNorth Carolina's House select committee on oversight and reform is questioning the board's actions. They scheduled a hearing for July 23 at 9 a.m. to address their concerns and hear from board members.\n\nCo-Chair of the House select committee Rep. Jake Johnson, R-Polk, said the board of elections needs to follow the statutes on party ballot access.\n\n\"The requirements political parties must meet to be recognized are outlined in statute,\" Johnson said in an email statement from his legislative office. \"We're not going to move the goal posts to keep them off the ballot after they've met those requirements.\"\n\nDuring the July 9 meeting, the board voted to certify the Constitution Party despite concerns about the chair's address in a previous meeting. The party will have until July 23 to submit their candidates.\n\nA follow-up meeting to discuss We the People and Justice for All will be scheduled promptly, Democratic chair of the state board Alan Hirsch promised, but he did not set an exact date saying they haven't had time to review the evidence yet.", "source": {"uri": "citizen-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Asheville Citizen Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_People_(petitioning_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "We the People (petitioning system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Third party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

The Constitution Party is known for conservative values, while the other two would likely draw Democrat voters away from Biden.\n\n\"Democrats on the NC State Board of Elections are tipping the scale in favor of Biden, trying to control who's on the ballot,\" said the Fair Election Fund, a political action group concerned with \"free and fair\" elections. \"By blocking competition, they're blocking your voting rights.\"\n\nNo date has yet been set for the next board meeting, which, according to Cox, will be in the next two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@ktbs.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "elyse_apel@ktbs.com", "name": "Elyse Apel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_House_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on House Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_for_All_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justice for All Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_North_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elections in North Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719320", "eventUri": "eng-9719320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 439}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1048, "textEnd": 1054}], "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Voters may register with the Constitution, Democratic, Green, Libertarian, No Labels, or Republican parties, or they can register as unaffiliated. This recognition also means that voters currently registered with a different political party or as unaffiliated may switch their affiliation to the Constitution Party if they wish. For information on how to do that, see Updating Registration.\n\nThe Constitution Party of North Carolina also will have candidates on ballots in November, which it chose during its 2024 nominating convention. They include Walter Vinny Smith for governor and Wayne Jones for lieutenant governor. A letter to the State Board indicated that the party would have additional candidates, but the party did not want to disclose their names until it was recognized. The Board set a deadline of July 23 for the Constitution Party to provide the names of its candidates for the 2024 general election.\n\nThe State Board is updating voter registration applications to include the new political party option. Until then, voters may register with the new party by checking the \"Other\" box and writing \"Constitution Party\" on the line in the \"Political Party Affiliation\" section of the voter registration form.\n\nState Board voter data also will be updated to include the new party registrants.\n\nAccording to a review by State Board staff, the Constitution Party submitted 14,022 valid signatures from registered N.C. voters, 157 more than the required 13,855 signatures. The signatures were verified by the county boards of elections of the counties in which they were collected. The Constitution Party also received at least 200 signatures from three different congressional districts, a requirement of \"Political party\" defined; creation of new party.

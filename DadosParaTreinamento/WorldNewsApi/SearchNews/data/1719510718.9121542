{"id": 223762082, "title": "Haitians anticipate a more determined and hungrier Dumornay after Champions League final defeat", "text": "CAP-HAITIEN \u2014 Haitian Women\u2019s National Soccer Team superstar, Melchie \u2018Corventina\u2019 Dumornay, fell short Saturday of becoming the first Grenadier to lift a UEFA Champions League trophy. Her team, Olympique Lyonnais (OL), lost 2-0 to FC Barcelona in the final. However, many Haitian fans were still satisfied as Dumornay became the first Haitian, man or woman, to play in a final of Europe\u2019s most prestigious soccer competition. They expect this loss will inspire her to elevate her game even further. \u201cLosing in a final is a step towards winning one,\u201d stated John S\u00e9v\u00e8re, head coach of the legendary Haitian club, Football Inter Club Association (FICA). \u201cLosing a final is never easy,\u201d S\u00e9v\u00e8re added. \u201cBut one can lose in a final and soon find themselves in another. We might see Corventina in another final; she could be the perfect example for that.\u201d Dumornay, hailing from Mirebalais, a commune in the Central Department, has established herself as a promising young woman soccer player on the global stage. Despite Haiti\u2019s multiple crises, the 20-year-old central midfielder has proven that greatness can still emerge from the country. Her remarkable performances in soccer have won the hearts of many Haitians. In the semi-finals of the Champions League, Dumornay was arguably the most valuable player for OL against Paris Saint Germain, scoring goals and providing two assists to help her side win 5-3 on aggregate. Thus, she became the first Haitian player to reach a Champions League final. Many Haitians watched the final on Saturday, hoping Dumornay would have made history by becoming the first Haitian to win a UEFA Champions League title. Unfortunately, Lyon lost the match 2-0 to a skillful Barcelona side, which now holds three Champions League titles. Dumornay had a quiet game, perhaps due to playing striker instead of her natural position as central midfield. However, many Haitians, including athletes, were proud to see a compatriot compete in the final of such a prestigious event. \u201cWhen you look at the score, it\u2019s a loss for France but it\u2019s not a loss for Haiti because something big happened,\u201d said Peterson Joseph, forward for the Haitian club Cosmopolites Sportif Club. \u201cA lot of people, a lot of other nations playing soccer at a higher level than us, would have liked to be here.\u201d Like S\u00e9v\u00e8re, many Haitians hope that Durmornay will use the loss as motivation to improve and triumph in her next possible final. \u201cTough times like these make you learn who you are, what level you\u2019re at, where you came from, and where you want to reach,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cTimes like these make you even stronger.\u201d Haitians are already looking forward to next season\u2019s UEFA Women\u2019s Champions League final, hoping that Dumornay\u2019s side will claim the trophy this time around. \u201cI think she will win the Champions League one day,\u201d said Michelet Jerome, an electrical engineer based in Port-au-Prince. \u201cShe\u2019s young, she\u2019s only 20. I hope she keeps playing football at the level she\u2019s at. All Haitians are behind her. She\u2019s our pride.\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"720\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?fit=720%2C900&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"Melchie Dumornay, Champions League,\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1 240w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?resize=400%2C500&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?resize=706%2C883&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?fit=720%2C900&amp;ssl=1&amp;w=370 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 34.9rem) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 53rem) calc(8 * (100vw / 12)), (min-width: 53rem) calc(6 ", "url": "https://haitiantimes.com/2024/05/26/dumornay-fell-short-of-winning-champions-league-title/", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FB_IMG_1716670975977.jpg?fit=720%2C900&ssl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Onz Ch\u00e9ry", "authors": ["Onz Ch\u00e9ry"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.062}

{"id": 232031852, "title": "My hay fever is so bad I feel I should be allowed to take to my hypoallergenic sheets", "text": "Ever year, the same tired routine. May rolls around, and we brace ourselves, praying to the gods of summer that this will be one of those rare, glorious years when the pollen plague passes over us without taking its pound of tissue paper. As June approaches, we start to get cocky: I might go outside. I might sit on the grass. Why not? Fear is for mortal men, and I am invincible. And then \u2013 the first sniffles. The dry eyes. The regret at having been born. Maybe it isn\u2019t that bad, we think at first \u2013 maybe it\u2019s just the flu, or Covid. But no, we aren\u2019t that lucky. The days press on, and our eyes get redder and itchier, and eventually we have to acknowledge the horrible truth: we still have hay fever, and it\u2019s just as bad as it\u2019s always been. This June promises to be a particularly rough month for suffers, as experts say pollen levels could triple over the next few weeks. This weekend in particular saw an especially nasty rise, so if you\u2019ve spent the past 48 hours raging against a cruel and uncaring universe, just know there\u2019s a good reason. I know I have. I work weekends, and while I\u2019m not saying I deserve a medal for struggling through my job these past two days, surely at least some sort of certificate is in order? Maybe a fruit basket or edible arrangement? Anything except flowers, really. You have to wonder at what point an employer should be duty-bound to recognise this terrible affliction, and put the appropriate measures in place to accommodate them (ie letting me lie down in a dark room with an ice pack on my face instead of doing anything that resembles my job). How can I be expected to get anything done when all I can think about is how good it would feel to rip my own eyes out and put them in the freezer? If you\u2019re one of those genetic freaks whose body doesn\u2019t completely shut down in the presence of shrubbery, you probably don\u2019t appreciate how bad it can get, but you have to understand: hay fever is no joke. It restricts your breathing, it makes it hard to see, it ruins your mood, and most importantly of all, it lasts for months with no breaks. And for what? The proliferation of fauna and the continued survival of life on Earth? Is any of that really worth it? Every day I wake up after a night of fitful, constantly interrupted sleep, only to feel as though my face has been colonised by a swarm of spiteful fire ants. My eyes \u2013 if you can call them that, since they no longer perform many of the functions that eyes are supposed to \u2013 feel like they\u2019ve been taken out of my head and rolled around in sand. All I want to do is rub them, which I obviously can\u2019t, because that\u2019s not good for them, but which I obviously do anyway, because I am a human being made of flesh and nerves. My nose is somehow too dry and too wet, all at the same time. It really feels like there\u2019s something lodged up there, and that if I could remove it, all of my problems would go away. But there\u2019s nothing up there. That\u2019s just another one of hay fever\u2019s sick pranks. If I meet an important person, or somebody I\u2019m attracted to, it\u2019s only a matter of time before I sneeze on or near them. And this won\u2019t just be any sneeze \u2013 it\u2019s going to be one of those sneezes where you make a weird, sad whimpering noise. Goodbye self-respect \u2013 goodbye the respect of others. The only way to mitigate any of this is to stay indoors, preferably in the dark, preferably while unconscious \u2013 and I can\u2019t do those things while I\u2019m in work. Something needs to change, or I\u2019m going to lose it. There\u2019s an election in just a few weeks. If any party promises to bring in legislation that will let me take a sick day when the pollen count is this high, I\u2019ll vote for them, no questions asked. I don\u2019t care about the economy, or schools, or hospitals, or any of that small-potato stuff \u2013 it\u2019s time to bring our long, itchy national nightmare to an end.", "summary": "<p>As the pollen count goes up, my ability to do my job plummets, writes Ryan Coogan.

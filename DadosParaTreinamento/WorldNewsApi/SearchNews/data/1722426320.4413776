The People\u2019s Team has had one of their worst starts in the domestic top-flight this season in which they have won just three out of 10 matches. Bullets have drawn six games and lost once. They have bagged 15 out of a possible 30 points and lie fifth in the 16-team league. To rub salt into the wound, Bullets players staged a training boycott early this week to force the team\u2019s management to address their grievances. In a pre-match interview, Bullets head coach Kallisto Pasuwa said they are determined to turn the corner. He said: \u201cThe only challenge that we have is that we are not able to make good use of the chances we create. \u201cIt is a psychological problem and we need to encourage the players more to turn the situation around. It\u2019s something to do with pressure and they need to relax.\u201d The former Dynamos FC and Zimbabwe National Football Team coach said they have bee concentrating on those aspects. Last week, Pasuwa said he was worried that only attacking midfielder Patrick Mwaungulu is scoring for the champions. KB are enjoying a good run as they have 19 points from 10 matches, having won five, drawn four and lost only once. Their marksman Zelliat Nkhoma is the league\u2019s leading scorer with eight goals and playing at home should give them an edge. Last season, Bullets won the second round encounter 3-2 while the first round match ended goalless. Both teams are coming from draws against rookies with Bullets having been held to a one-all draw against Creck Sporting Club while the Charles Kamanga troops played out a goalless draw against Baka City. Kamanga could not be reached for comment. In other matches, newly-promoted Fomo FC host Moyale Barracks at Mulanje Park Stadium while table anchors Baka City face Bangwe All Stars at Karonga Stadium.", "summary": "<p>TNM Super League reigning champions FCB Nyasa Bullets will be out to end their three-game winless run when they face second-placed Kamuzu Barracks (KB) at Civo Stadium in Lilongwe this afternoon.

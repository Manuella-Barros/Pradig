Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Massoud Barzani's close adviser and uncle Hoshyar Zebari said, commenting on the request communicated by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\n\nThe United States has asked Iraq's Kurds to postpone a referendum on the independence of their autonomous Kurdish region, the Kurdish presidency said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made the request on Friday, during a phone call with the president of Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government, Massoud Barzani.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said the statement issued by the Kurdish presidency after Tillerson's call, giving no further details on the Kurdish leader's reaction to the U.S. request.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are concerned that the vote could turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdistan Region's political parties, not including the second biggest party of Change (Gorran) Movement and the Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), came to an agreement on June 7 to hold a referendum on the region's independence on September 25, 2017. The decision was slammed by Iraq, US, UK, EU, Russia, Germany, Turkey and Iran.\n\nBaghdad, however, rejects the planned referendum, saying the move could adversely affect the region's ongoing fight against the Daesh terrorist group.\n\nRead more about Independent Kurdistan state", "time": "11:11:00"}

plan to hold an independence referendum on September 25, despite a U.S. request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum.\n\nTillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of IS militants.\n\nIS's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part.\n\nThe hardline militants remain however in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The United States has pledged to maintain its backing to allied forces in both countries until the militants' total defeat.\n\nThe Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War I, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n\nBarzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, told Reuters in July the Kurds would take responsibility for the expected 'yes' outcome of the referendum, and pursue its implementation through dialogue with Baghdad and regional powers to avoid conflict.\n\n\"We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, 'if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?',\" he said in an interview in the KRG capital, Erbil.\n\nKurdish officials have said disputed areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region, will be covered by the referendum, to determine whether they would want to remain or not in Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga in 2014 prevented IS from capturing Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs.\n\nHardline Iraqi militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin.\n\nReuters\n\nNext Page >", "time": "12:57:00"}

Kurdistan referendum\n\nThe US secretary of state has called on the leader of Iraq's semi-autonomous region Kurdistan region, Massoud Barzani, to delay a controversial referendum on independence from the mainland slated for next month.\n\nIn a telephone call on Friday, Rex Tillerson said Washington \"would want for the referendum to be postponed and that the issues between the Kurdistan region and the federal government in Baghdad should be addressed through dialogue,\" Barzani's office said in a statement.\n\nThe statement further said, \"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future.\"\n\nIt, however, did not elaborate on Barzani's reaction to the demand by the senior American official concerning the referendum that is due to take place on September 25.\n\nHowever, Reuters on Saturday quoted Hoshyar Zebari, Barzani's advisor, as saying that Iraq's Kurds will maintain their plan to hold the referendum.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" the Iraqi Kurdish official.\n\nThe developments came on the backdrop of the US State Department's expression of concern back in June that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the fight against Daesh terrorists.\n\nSenior officials in Baghdad as well as in neighboring states of Iran and Turkey have voiced concerns over the planned vote, warning against largely Western-backed attempts to partition Iraq.\n\nIn June, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi described as untimely the decision by Barzani to hold the referendum.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"Every part of Iraq has aspirations and has a dream, and we respect that, even if we disagree with it,\" Abadi said on June 13. \"We live in one homeland and they are our partners.\"\n\n\"We have a constitution that we've voted on, we have a federal parliament and a federal government...The referendum at this time is not opportune,\" he added.\n\nHis remarks came after Barzani announced in a Twitter message that the northern territory would hold an independence referendum in September not only in the three provinces that make up the Kurdish region but in the areas that are disputed by the Kurdish and the central Iraqi governments.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the Iraqi government also issued a statement saying that it would reject any unilateral move by regional Kurdish authorities to push for independence.\n\nTurkey has censured efforts to establish an independent Kurdistan as 'a grave mistake.\" Ankara has expressed fears that the potential of creating of an independent Kurdish state in its backyard would further embolden Turkey's homegrown Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants towards an even stiffer confrontation with the government.\n\nIn June, Iran also expressed opposition to the \"unilateral\" scheme, underlining the importance of maintaining the integrity and stability of Iraq and insisting that the Kurdistan region is part of the majority Arab state.", "time": "11:05:00"}

for September -- and called for dialog between the Kurdish region and Baghdad.\n\nBut Barzani is not convinced there is an \"alternative\" to the referendum at this stage, said a statement.\n\nTillerson also praised a decision by the Kurdish region's political leadership to send a delegation to Baghdad to hold talks with Iraqi officials to discuss the upcoming

worked for with the state of Iraq in the past and over various stages was not implemented, and that is why the people of Kurdistan have decided to take their own path,\" the statement

of Change (Gorran) Movement and the Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), came to an agreement on June 7 to hold a referendum on the region's independence on September 25, 2017. The decision was slammed by Iraq, US, UK, EU, Russia, Germany, Turkey and Iran.\n\nBaghdad, however, rejects the planned referendum, saying the move could adversely affect the region's ongoing fight against the Daesh terrorist group.\n\nThe Iraqi government also claims that the poll would violate Iraq's 2005 constitution and would be \"of no political or economic benefit to the region's Kurds\".\n\nRead more about Independent Kurdistan state", "time": "05:59:00"}

despite a U.S. request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum.\n\nTillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nIslamic State's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part.\n\nThe hardline Sunni militants remain however in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The United States has pledged to maintain its backing to allied forces in both countries until the militants' total defeat.\n\nThe Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n\nBarzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, told Reuters in July the Kurds would take responsibility for the expected 'yes' outcome of the referendum, and pursue its implementation through dialogue with Baghdad and regional powers to avoid conflict.\n\n\"We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, 'if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?',\" he said in an interview in the KRG capital, Erbil.\n\nIraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.\n\nThe country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The centre around Baghdad is mixed.\n\nKurdish officials have said disputed areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region, will be covered by the referendum, to determine whether they would want to remain or not in Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants.

the leader of Iraq's semi-autonomous region Kurdistan region, Massoud Barzani, to delay a controversial referendum on independence from the mainland slated for next month.\n\nIn a telephone call on Friday, Rex Tillerson said Washington \"would want for the referendum to be postponed and that the issues between the Kurdistan region and the federal government in Baghdad should be addressed through dialogue,\" Barzani's office said in a statement, presstv reported.\n\nThe statement further added that \"on the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President [Barzani] stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future.\"\n\nIt, however, did not elaborate on Barzani's reaction to the demand by the senior American official concerning the referendum that is due to take place on September 25.\n\nHowever, Reuters on Saturday quoted Hoshyar Zebari, Barzani's advisor, as saying that Iraq's Kurds will maintain their plan to hold the referendum.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" the Iraqi Kurdish official added.\n\nThe developments came on the backdrop of the US State Department's expression of concern back in June that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the fight against Daesh terrorists.\n\nSenior officials in Baghdad as well as in neighboring states of Iran and Turkey have voiced concerns over the planned vote, warning against largely Western-backed attempts to partition Iraq.\n\nIn June, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi described as untimely the decision by Barzani to hold the referendum.\n\n\"Every part of Iraq has aspirations and has a dream, and we respect that, even if we disagree with it,\" Abadi said, adding that \"we live in one homeland and they are our partners.\"\n\n\"We have a constitution that we've voted on, we have a federal parliament and a federal government... The referendum at this time is not opportune,\" he stressed.\n\nHis remarks came after Barzani announced in a Twitter message that the Northern territory would hold an independence referendum in September not only in the three provinces that make up the Kurdish region but in the areas that are disputed by the Kurdish and the central Iraqi governments.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the Iraqi government also issued a statement saying that it would reject any unilateral move by regional Kurdish authorities to push for independence.\n\nTurkey has censured efforts to establish an independent Kurdistan as \"a grave mistake.\" Ankara has expressed fears that the potential of creating of an independent Kurdish state in its backyard would further embolden Turkey's homegrown Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants towards an even stiffer confrontation with the government.\n\nIran also expressed opposition to the \"unilateral\" scheme, underlining the importance of maintaining the integrity and stability of Iraq and insisting that the Kurdistan region is part of the majority Arab state.", "time": "12:24:00"}

The United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum. Tillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call. The U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nIslamic State's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part. The hardline Sunni militants remain however in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The United States has pledged to maintain its backing to allied forces in both countries until the militants' total defeat.\n\nThe Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. Barzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, told Reuters in July the Kurds would take responsibility for the expected 'yes' outcome of the referendum, and pursue its implementation through dialogue with Baghdad and regional powers to avoid conflict.\n\n\"We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, 'if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?',\" he said in an interview in the KRG capital, Erbil. Iraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.\n\nThe country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The centre around Baghdad is mixed. Kurdish officials have said disputed areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region, will be covered by the referendum, to determine whether they would want to remain or not in Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs. Hardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App", "time": "12:45:00"}

"Erbil, Iraq: Iraq's Kurds are sticking to a plan to hold an independence referendum on September 25, despite a US request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official said on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, September 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum.\n\nTillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call.\n\nThe US State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nIslamic State's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when US-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part.\n\nThe hardline Sunni militants, however, remain in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria.

independence referendum on Sept. 25, despite a U.S. request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum.\n\nTillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nIslamic State's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part.\n\nThe hardline Sunni militants remain however in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The United States has pledged to maintain its backing to allied forces in both countries until the militants' total defeat.\n\nThe Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n\nBarzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, told Reuters in July the Kurds would take responsibility for the expected 'yes' outcome of the referendum, and pursue its implementation through dialogue with Baghdad and regional powers to avoid conflict.\"We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, 'if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?',\" he said in an interview in the KRG capital, Erbil.\n\nIraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.\n\nThe country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The centre around Baghdad is mixed.\n\nKurdish officials have said disputed areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region, will be covered by the referendum, to determine whether they would want to remain or not in Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs.\n\nHardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "11:45:00"}

and elders from the cities of the Kurdistan region in Erbil August 9, 2017. -- Reuters picBAGHDAD, Aug 12 -- Washington has urged Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani to postpone an independence referendum scheduled for next month but he requested something in return, his office said today.\n\nThe timing of the September 25 vote has drawn criticism from both the Baghdad and Western governments, coming as the campaign against the Islamic State jihadist group in Iraq if still unfinished.\n\nIn a telephone call yesterday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington \"would want for the referendum to be postponed and that the issues between the Kurdistan region and the federal government in Baghdad should be addressed through dialogue\", Barzani's office said in an English-language statement.\n\nThe Kurdish leader responded that were it to be put off, \"the people of the Kurdistan region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future\".\n\nSome Iraqi Kurdish officials have openly acknowledged that calling the referendum was intended as a bargaining counter in negotiations with Baghdad on other issues.\n\nThe Kurdish regional government's representative in Iran, Nazem Dabbagh, said last month that the Kurds wanted Baghdad to meet their longstanding demand for plebiscites on incorporating other historically Kurdish-majority areas in their autonomous region.\n\nHe said they also wanted Baghdad to ratify laws on oil revenues and funding for the Kurdish security forces, known as the peshmerga, who have played a crucial role in the

Kurds are sticking to a plan to hold an independence referendum on September 25, despite a US request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint.

living in Turkey, Iran and Syria have their own features and identify themselves as distinct people, the governor of an Iraqi governorate said.\n\nThe governor of the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk, Najmaldin Karim, said in an interview with Sputnik that Kurds may create several independent states like the Arabs did when they established the Arab League, which comprises over 20 states.\n\nThe Kurdistan Region's political parties, not including the second biggest party of Change (Gorran) Movement and the Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), came to an agreement on June 7 to hold a referendum on the region's independence on September 25, 2017. The decision was slammed by Iraq, US, UK, EU, Russia, Germany, Turkey and Iran.\n\nFollowing the announcement, authorities of the Kurdish-controlled Kirkuk province decided to take part in the referendum.\n\n\"Each part of Kurdistan has its own features. Kurds in Turkey, Iran, Syria determine themselves what they want. There are 22 Arab countries and we may have more than one Kurdish state,\" Karim said.\n\nHe pointed out that the province of Kirkuk is an inherent part of Iraqi Kurdistan and has a right to participate in the referendum on the region's independence.\n\nThe Kurds, making up about 20 percent of the Iraqi population, have been seeking self-governance for decades. In 2005, Iraq's Constitution recognized Kurdistan as an autonomous region, run by the Kurdistan Regional Government, therefore making Iraqi Kurdistan the only autonomous region of the country.\n\nNeed to be mentioned Iraqi Kurds are not unified, Barzani's KDP controls half of Kurdistan and PUK the rest. The Kurdish Peshmerga are not unified forces and considered as militias loyal and taking orders of the ruling parties of PUK and KDP. Kurds have two security and intelligence agencies. Kurdish parliament is closed by Barzani after his term as president of Kurdistan ended on August 20, 2015 but refused to step down and remains unofficially in office.\n\nKurds, who have never had their own state, are dispersed across Syria, Iraq and Turkey, where they are largest ethnic minority. A portion of the Kurdish population also lives in Iran.\n\nEstimated to over 40 million Kurds live in Greater Kurdistan which covers an area as big as France splits between (Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Iran).\n\nThe Turkish government, which still denies the constitutional existence of the Kurds and who make up around 22.5 million of the country's 79-million population, has long struggled to prevent the Kurds from gaining independence. Erdogan said during the latest G20 summit in Hamburg that Ankara will not allow establishment of a Kurdish state in southern Turkey.\n\nRead more about Independent Kurdistan state", "time": "13:06:00"}

of the country's border crossings with the region, Nazim Dabbagh, the representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Tehran, said on Wednesday.\n\nIran has been clear in its position in reaction to the plans of holding an independence referendum on Sept. 25 this year, urging the Kurdistan Region to reverse such a decision, Dabbagh told NRT in a statement.\n\n\"It is improbable to happen [closure of border crossings by Iran after the referendum],\" Dabbagh said. \"No time has been scheduled for talks with Iran over the Kurdistan Region's referendum, though they [Iran] have clearly told the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) their opposition stance.\"\n\nTehran's backing militarily for the Peshmerga forces in the fight against Islamic State (ISIS) may also come to an end in the outcome of holding the referendum, he added.\n\n\"Tehran has expressed a willingness to help mend pending issues between Erbil and Baghdad.\" Iran seems to have the same position that Baghdad has towards the referendum on the independence of Kurdistan, he further said.\n\nThe autonomous northern Kurdistan Region is expected to hold a referendum on September 25 with the aim to establish an independent state.\n\nThe decision to hold referendum has concerned Iran. On May 1, the spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Bahram Qassemi, said Iran was against a referendum in the Kurdistan Region and stated it considered Kurds an important part of Iraq's sovereignty.\n\nThe Kurdistan Region's political parties, not including the second biggest party of Change (Gorran) Movement and the Kurdistan Islamic Group (KIG), came to an agreement on June 7 to hold a referendum on the region's independence on September 25, 2017.\n\nThe decision was slammed by Iraq, US, UK, EU, Russia, Germany, Turkey and Iran.\n\nKurds say the expected \"yes\" outcome would strengthen their hand in talks on self-determination with Baghdad, and would not automatically mean declaring independence.\n\nRead more about Independent Kurdistan state\n\nCopyright \u00a9, respective author or news agency, nrttv.com | Ekurd.net", "time": "07:25:00"}

independence referendum on Sept. 25, despite a U.S. request to postpone it, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Saturday.\n\nThe United States and other Western nations are worried that the vote could ignite a fresh conflict with Baghdad and turn into another regional flashpoint. Turkey, Iran and Syria, which together with Iraq have sizeable Kurdish populations, all oppose an independent Kurdistan.\n\n\"The date is standing, Sept. 25, no change,\" said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani, after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Barzani to postpone the referendum.\n\nTillerson made the request in a phone call with Barzani on Thursday, Zebari said.\n\n\"On the issue of the postponement of the referendum, the President (Barzani) stated that the people of the Kurdistan Region would expect guarantees and alternatives for their future,\" said a statement issued on Friday by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) presidency, after Tillerson's call.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in June it was concerned that the referendum will distract from \"more urgent priorities\" such as the defeat of Islamic State militants.\n\nIslamic State's self-proclaimed \"caliphate\" effectively collapsed last month, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces completed the takeover of the militants' capital in Iraq, Mosul, after a nine-month campaign in which Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part.\n\nThe hardline Sunni militants remain however in control of territory in western Iraq and eastern Syria. The United States has pledged to maintain its backing to allied forces in both countries until the militants' total defeat.\n\nThe Kurds have been seeking an independent state since at least the end of World War One, when colonial powers divided up the Middle East, but their territory ended up split between modern-day Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n\nBarzani, whose father led struggles against Baghdad in the 1960s and 1970s, told Reuters in July the Kurds would take responsibility for the expected 'yes' outcome of the referendum, and pursue its implementation through dialogue with Baghdad and regional powers to avoid conflict.\n\n\"We have to rectify the history of mistreatment of our people and those who are saying that independence is not good, our question to them is, 'if it's not good for us, why is it good for you?',\" he said in an interview in the KRG capital, Erbil.\n\nIraq has been led by Shi'ites since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, by the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.\n\nThe country's majority Shi'ite community mainly lives in the south while the Kurds and Sunni Arabs inhabit two corners of the north. The centre around Baghdad is mixed.\n\nKurdish officials have said disputed areas, including the oil-rich Kirkuk region, will be covered by the referendum, to determine whether they would want to remain or not in Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdish Peshmerga in 2014 prevented Islamic State from capturing Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, after the Iraqi army fled in the face of the militants. They are effectively running the region, also claimed by Turkmen and Arabs.\n\nHardline Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias have threatened to expel the Kurds by force from this region and three other disputed areas - Sinjar, Makhmour and Khanaqin.

years ago, a proud and independent nation lived and thrived in its own land in the heart of the Middle East. Down through the ages, although subject to many foreign invasions, this ethnically distinct people refused to be integrated with their various conquerors, but retained their individual culture. At the start of the First World War, their country was a small part of the Ottoman empire. In shaping the future Middle East after the war the Allied powers, and in particular the United Kingdom, promised to act as guarantors of this people's freedom. That promise was subsequently broken.\n\nNo, this is not the story of the Jewish people. It is the broad outline of the long, convoluted and unresolved history of the Kurds.\n\nThe Kurds - more than 30 million strong - are the largest stateless nation in the world. Historically they inhabited a distinct geographical area flanked by mountain ranges, once referred to as Kurdistan. No such location is depicted on current maps, for the old Kurdistan now falls within the sovereign space of four separate states: Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. Most Kurds - some 25 million - live within Turkey's borders, but the 2 million Kurds in Syria are the country's largest minority, while within Iraq the 5 million Kurds have developed a near autonomous state. Nearly 7 million Kurds are trapped inside Iran's extremist Shi'ite regime.\n\nIt was shortly after the end of the First World War that, orchestrated by Britain and France, the dissolution and partition of the Ottoman Empire were set out in the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. In abolishing the Ottoman Empire, the treaty stipulated a referendum to decide the issue of the Kurdistan homeland,\n\nThat referendum never took place, and the S\u00e8vres treaty itself was rendered null and void in 1922 by the establishment of the Turkish Republic under Kemal Ataturk. What followed was a new treaty, the Treaty of Lausanne, which gave control of the entire Anatolian peninsula, including the large portion of the Kurdistan homeland that lay within it, to the new republic. With a stroke of the colonial pen over 20 million Kurds were declared Turkish.\n\nKurdish nationalism in Turkey developed largely as a reaction to the secular nationalism that revolutionized the country under Ataturk. After years of struggle, Mustafa Barzani emerged as the figurehead for Kurdish separatism. Comprising about 20 percent of Turkey's 77 million population, fractious Kurds were a constant political problem for Turkey.\n\nIn Syria the civil war, starting in 2011, brought the Kurds to the forefront of the region's politics. In the face of Islamic State's (IS) military advance, Syrian government forces abandoned many Kurdish occupied areas in the north and north-east of the country, leaving the Kurds to administer them. In October 2011, sponsored by Iraqi Kurdish President Masoud Barzani, the Syrian Kurds established a Kurdish National Council (KNC). The KNC is now initiating elections intended to consolidate an autonomous Kurdish region within whatever Syrian state eventually emerges.\n\nYears of rebellion by the Kurds of Iraq ended in 1970 with a peace deal with the government, granting the Kurds a degree of self-rule and recognition of their language. When Mustafa Barzani died in 1979, the leadership of the KDP passed to his son, Masoud. But a new rival force had emerged in Kurdish politics with the founding by Jalal Talabani of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The journey towards a unified Kurdish movement in Iraq was long and bitter, but finally, in 1998, a joint leadership deal was signed. Eventually the PUK and the KDP set up a unified regional government, and Masoud Barzani became a member of Iraq's Governing Council.\n\nWhen the Americans invaded Iraq in 2003, the Peshmerga troops of the Kurds - who retained bitter memories of Saddam Hussein's poison gas attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja - joined in the fight to overthrow him. After he was driven from office the Iraqi people, in a national referendum, approved a new constitution which recognized the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) as an integral element in Iraq's administration. Barzani was elected President of Iraqi Kurdistan in June 2005.\n\nIn June 2014 IS began its conquest of much of western and northern Iraq. The Iraqi military largely disintegrated. It was Kurdish Peshmerga forces that stepped in, taking control of Kirkuk and other northern areas long claimed by the KRG but until then outside its control. The Peshmerga subsequently proved to be the most effective of the anti-IS fighting forces, backed as they were by the US-led coalition which adhered to its \"no boots on the ground\" policy.\n\nIn June 2017, with Mosul in the final stages of being recaptured from IS, Kurdish president Barzani announced that an independence referendum would take place on 25 September 2017 encompassing not only the area within the administration of the KRG, but also three adjacent regions, largely occupied by Kurds but claimed by the central government.\n\nIn announcing the referendum, the leadership made it clear that a \"Yes\" vote would not automatically trigger a declaration of independence. It would, however, greatly strengthen the Kurds' bargaining position in future talks with the central government on self-determination.\n\nTurkey's initial reaction to the referendum announcement was critical. So indeed was that of the US and the UK - the main burden of their opposition being that the referendum was \"untimely\". The US understood \"the legitimate aspirations of the people of Iraqi Kurdistan\", but believed that they should concentrate on repairing the ravages of war and on collaborating with, rather than confronting, the central government. Baghdad had already rejected the referendum call. \"No party can, on its own, decide the fate of Iraq, in isolation from the other parties,\" said Saad al-Haddithi, Iraqi government spokesman.\n\nShortly after Barzani announced the referendum, Saudi Arabia came out in support. Other Sunni states in the Saudi-led coalition are likely to follow, since Turkey is siding with Qatar in their current conflict. Then on 25 July 2017 Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, in perhaps a knee-jerk reaction to the US's position, announced support for the referendum.\n\nThe Kurds are a brave and battle-hardened people yearning for national independence and the right of self-determination. Long the powerless pawns of others' interests, in taking this next step towards achieving autonomy the Kurds merit support. When the time comes for them to declare an independent Kurdistan, perhaps combining the areas in Iraq and Syria under their control, they deserve the recognition of the free world.", "time": "21:44:00"}

On June 7, Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani met with all the political parties in Kurdistan and they agreed on a September date for the vote.\n\nThe initiative has sparked opposition from the Iraqi government and Iran. Turkey also expresses concerns, fearing that the upcoming referendum would galvanize the Kurdish problem on its territory.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2017/ SAFIN HAMEDIraqi Kurdistan to Seek Compensation From Baghdad for 'Unfair' Attitude to KurdsThe United States sees the Kurds as an ally, including in the fight against Daesh in Syria and Iraq. Washington continues to provide support for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), but at the same time avoids openly endorsing the Kurds' push for independence in Iraq.\n\nIn July, US special presidential envoy Brett McGurk said that the Kurdistan Regional Government should not go forward with the planned referendum due to the complexities of keeping a cross-cultural, ethnic military coalition focused on its mission to defeat Daesh.\n\n\"We do not think the referendum should happen in September. Right now [Daesh] is not finished and we have to be clear about that,\" McGurk said at a press briefing.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik/ Irina KalashnikovaLavrov Hopes All Repercussions of Iraq Kurdistan Referendum to Be Taken Into AccountHe explained that the referendum, held on such a fast timeline, would be destabilizing for Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting against terrorism.\n\nAccording to Turkish political analyst Mahmut Bozarslan, McGurk's statement was of a temporary nature and did not reflect the actual political situation.\n\n\"I can't say that remark changed the balance of power in the region. I've talked to some Kurdish senior officials. According to them, Washington is not against the referendum and the statement [by special envoy McGurk] was of a temporary nature and served some immediate interests at the time,\" Bozarslan told Sputnik Turkey.\n\nCommenting on Washington's concerns, the expert pointed out that the US fears that if the Kurds establish an independent state the rest of Iraq would fall under the influence of Iran.\n\n\"I guess this was the main reason behind McGurk's remarks. Taking into account the current situation in the Middle East, the US needs Kurds. So, I don't think Washington is against the referendum. The US has invested a lot in the Kurds, including military and political support. Possibly, that statement also related to Washington's strategy on Turkey,\" Bozarslan said.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Ruben SprichIran FM Says Kurdish Referendum 'Wrong Choice', Impacts Iraqi SecurityIn an earlier interview with Sputnik, The Saker, a US-based top-level European military analyst and the author of the blog \"Vineyard of the Saker,\" noted that the Kurds continue to remain the only force the US can rely on in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\"The Kurds are the only possible candidates for the role of 'boots on the ground' for the US. It is, therefore, no wonder that the Americans would try to use them in some way,\" The Saker told Sputnik.\n\nThe military analyst added, \"That, in turn, implies that the Americans must give the Kurds something, such as a promise of some kind of more or less independent Kurdistan, to entice them to play this role.\"\n\nAccording to Bozarslan, establishing a sovereign Kurdish state would serve Washington's long-run plans for the Middle East.\n\n\"The US signals that its wants Iraq to be a federative state, but in fact Washington would prefer an independent Kurdish state over the weakened and politically unstable Iraq. Moreover, such a scenario would comply with Washington's plan in the Middle East in the long run,\" he suggested.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2017/ DELIL SOULEIMAN In Pursuit of a New State? Why US So Eagerly Helping Syrian KurdsCommenting further, Bozarslan said that currently the situation in the Middle East is highly unstable and the US may be concerned over the possible risk of a Kurdish-Arab conflict if the referendum takes place.\n\n\"This may be another reason behind McGurk's remark. On the other hand, I think that despite such serious concerns the US will not oppose the vote,\" the expert said.\n\nIn conclusion, Bozarslan assumed that if the referendum takes place its result would have an immediate effect on the Kurdish problem in Syria.\n\n\"Despite the fact that Damascus is focused on its domestic issues, the upcoming referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan is a matter of concern. If Kurds establish an independent state in Iraq this would immediately echo in Rojava [a de facto autonomous Kurdish region in northern Syria],\" Bozarslan said.", "time": "12:52:00"}

In an exclusive interview with Manish Rai, editorViewsaround. Kurdistan Foreign Minister Mr Falah Mustafa said that independent Kurdistan will not be against the interest of its neighbours. Mr Mustafa added Kurdistan will pursue the good neighbourly relations based on mutual respect, understanding, and benefit. Following is the detailed interview of Kurdish Foreign Minister;\n\nQ: How you will pursue Kurdistan powerful neighbours like Turkey and Iran to lend support to Kurdistan?\n\nA: Regarding the neighbourhood, we assure our neighbours that this step will not go against the interest of these nations. As a factor for stability, we have always wanted good neighbourly relations based on mutual respect, understanding, and benefit. We are for building bridges and we can assure them that the future independent Kurdistan would be a partner and ally.\n\nWe want our neighbours and the whole world to understand that we have always stood for peace. Now time has come for Erbil and Baghdad to be courageous enough to admit that we have failed and if we continue to insist on failure, we will not bring about a different outcome, therefore we believe that friends and partners should not insist on a failed one Iraq policy. In order to prevent future confrontations, we need to address this issue now. We need to be realistic to address it in such a way that it would bring about stability and security because the current situation is only a recipe for further violence and instability.\n\nQ: After the independence of Kurdistan what relations will you pursue with Baghdad?\n\nA: We need to communicate with Baghdad, we need to ensure that they understand our ambitions and plans, and we do not want conflict with Baghdad, but we want friendship and partnership. We believe that we can become better partners as two sovereign states. Kurdistan can become Iraq's corridor in its relations with Turkey, Europe, and beyond. Likewise, Iraq can operate as Kurdistan's corridor in communicating with the Gulf Countries and beyond.\n\nIt will not be the end of the world when we decide that we cannot live together under one ceiling. Looking back at history, there are other nations that have accepted to be separate peacefully, through dialogue and now they enjoy very good relations. It's a fact of life that the Middle East region in the last hundred years had not seen stability and prosperity because of the wrong doings of the past, denial of identity, and lack of social justice.\n\nToday there is an opportunity for us to be courageous and to admit that we have failed in bringing about a genuine partnership, therefore engaging in a serious process of negotiations and communication with Baghdad is very important so that we communicate and, we don't make room for provocation because this is a national demand for the people of Kurdistan, not a political demand. We want Baghdad to be our partners in addressing this issue so we can do it in such a way that we secure a long term strong partnership with Baghdad. Our belief is that Baghdad is important today and tomorrow, and we seek good returns with Baghdad.\n\nQ: What will the governance structure of the proposed independent Kurdistan be? Will it be a democratic secular republic?\n\nA: The decision about the future governance structure of Kurdistan will be decided during our planning period of the day-after referendum. The political parties with the rest of the communities here will work together in the establishment of a new form of governance. Most importantly, as a nation that strongly believes in democratic principles and adopt them as our core values; we will make sure that our government is a democratic and representative one. We will make sure to stand for an inclusive society adhering to rights of all the communities in Kurdistan. Religious, cultural, and educational rights of the different communities in Kurdistan will be respected. Learning from our past experiences, we want to build a society where all the communities are equal partners. Whether we decide to have a parliamentary, presidency, or hybrid system, will be dependent on our political agreements made the day-after. Nevertheless, principles of human rights, empowerment of youth and women, protection of minorities, etc... Will remain to be cornerstones for our governance. The good governance and transparency, values and principles will be enshrined in our constitution.\n\nQ: How will the constitution of the Kurdistan be drafted? Will common people have a say?\n\nA: The draft-constitution we have for our region now was prepared by a committee then it went through the parliament, and then it was supposed to be approved by the people through a referendum. We will make sure that the people of Kurdistan have a say in their future constitution of Kurdistan.\n\nQ: Will all the Kurdish parties accept the outcome of this referendum?\n\nA: The referendum is a democratic process which is a practice for self-determination. All parties are obliged to respect the will of the people. There will be people who vote yes and there will be people voting no, both are acceptable in a democracy and the majority vote needs to be respected by all components of government. Examples of recent a referendum has been the Brexit one, which resulted in a very narrow margin between the yes and no votes.\n\nQ: How will the issue of disputed territories between Irbil and Bagdad be solved?\n\nA: People of Kurdistan in areas outside KRG Administration as well as in the Diaspora will get a vote. This vote is a yes and no answer to the question \"Do you want an independent Kurdistan\". This vote is not to resolve the issues of the disputed territories. Baghdad's failure to implement Article 140 of the Constitution (which promised a referendum on future of these territories, among other things) leaves the issue of disputed territories in Iraq unresolved. However, KRG being a responsible government, will through peaceful constructive attempts of dialogue with Baghdad or a secondary referendum in the future, work on resolving the issues of disputed territories.\n\nQ: Some Iraqi politicians especially Former Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki declared this referendum unconstitutional. How you react to this?\n\nA: The time when Iraq's politics began to take a wrong direction towards unilateral rule and instability was during Former Prime Minister Al Maliki's time. During Nawroz (March) 2012 my president sent an alarming alert to everyone in Iraq that political process of the country is taking the wrong direction. Unfortunately, no serious attention was paid to the presidents warning.\n\nOn the same note, Baghdad is unconstitutional regarding being responsible for not establishing the necessary institutions and laws for a healthy federal system. For instance, Baghdad is to be blamed for lack a Federal Council, a hydrocarbon law, a revenue sharing law, Status of the Peshmerga, resolving of article 140, etc. In addition to the breaches to the constitution, the budget of Kurdistan was cut. In the preamble of the constitution it is clearly stated that a commitment to this constitution is a guarantee for Iraq to remain united\u009d, therefore, adherence to constitution is a prerequisite for Iraq to be united. Unfortunately, despite our voluntary commitments to remain united, Baghdad breached the constitution on many occasions through exclusion of Sunni Arabs in the decision-making process arena, being hostile to the Kurds and minorities, among other marginalization attitudes and policies.", "time": "22:45:00"}

Good governance and transparency, values and principles will be enshrined in our constitution.\n\nHow will the constitution of Kurdistan be drafted? Will common people have a say?\n\nThe draft constitution ... was prepared by a committee, then it went through the parliament, and then it was supposed to be approved by the people through a referendum. We will make sure that the people of Kurdistan have a say in their future constitution.\n\nWill all the Kurdish parties accept the outcome of this referendum?\n\nThe referendum is a democratic process. All parties are obliged to respect the will of the people. There will be people who vote yes and there will be people voting no; both are acceptable in a democracy, and the majority vote needs to be respected by all components of government.\n\nHow will the issue of disputed territories between Erbil and Baghdad be solved?\n\nPeople of Kurdistan in areas outside the KRG [Kurdistan Regional Government] administration as well as in the diaspora will get a vote. This vote is a yes [or] no answer to the question: \"Do you want an independent Kurdistan?\" This vote is not to resolve the issues of the disputed territories. Baghdad's failure to implement Article 140 of the constitution [which promised a referendum on the future of these territories, among other things] leaves the issue of disputed territories in Iraq unresolved. However, the KRG will through peaceful, constructive attempts of dialogue with Baghdad or a secondary referendum in the future work on resolving the issues of disputed territories.\n\nSome Iraqi politicians, especially former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki, have declared this referendum unconstitutional. How do you react to this?\n\nIraq's politics began to take a wrong direction toward unilateral rule and instability during former prime minister al-Maliki's time. During Nawroz [Kurdish new year in March] 2012, my president sent an alarming alert to everyone in Iraq that the political process of the country was taking the wrong direction. Unfortunately, no serious attention was paid to the president's warning.\n\nOn the same note, Baghdad is unconstitutional in regards to being responsible for not establishing the necessary institutions and laws for a healthy federal system. For instance, Baghdad is to be blamed for the lack a federal council, a hydrocarbon law, a revenue-sharing law, status of the Peshmerga, resolving Article 140, etc. In addition to the aforementioned breaches to the constitution, the budget of Kurdistan was cut.\n\nIn the preamble of the constitution it is clearly stated that, \"Commitment to this constitution is a guarantee for Iraq to remain united.\" Therefore, adherence to the constitution is a prerequisite for Iraq to be united. Unfortunately, despite our voluntary commitments to remain united, Baghdad breached the constitution on many occasions through exclusion of Sunni Arabs in the decision-making process, being hostile to the Kurds and minorities, among other marginalization attitudes and policies.", "time": "20:00:00"}

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday requested Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani to postpone the independence referendum set for Sept. 25.\n\nAccording to a statement by Barzani's office, Barzani told Tillerson that the KRG decided to take care of itself after its efforts to coexist with Iraq failed.\n\n\"If the referendum is postponed, what kind of alternatives or guarantees are there for determining the future and fate of Kurdish people?\" Barzani said in response to the U.S. diplomat's request.\n\nTillerson said the KRG's decision to send a delegation to Baghdad was to find solutions to political issues through dialogue, the statement said.\n\nThe U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley also expressed concern on the planned referendum last month, claiming that it could cause \"a distraction from urgent priorities.\"\n\nIraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi also said that the upcoming Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum is not constitutional. Iran has also said that such a referendum would not be appropriate.\n\nThe KRG was created in 1970 in an agreement with the Iraqi government, putting years of fighting to an end. Later in 2005, it gained the right to autonomous governance in the constitution, but is still considered part of Iraq.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan, with a population of about 5 million, enjoys a high degree of autonomy, including its own parliament and armed forces, but relations with the central government in Baghdad have nosedived in recent years over a range of issues.\n\nThese include the sharing of oil revenues and control of some areas that are technically part of federal Iraq but have come under KRG control since 2014 during the war against Daesh.", "time": "16:06:00"}

They have been lightly edited for content and clarity. Opinions expressed by Iraqi News Contributors are their own.\n\nRAI: How will you persuade Kurdistan's powerful neighbors like Turkey and Iran to lend support to Kurdistan?\n\nMUSTAFA: We assure our neighbors that an Independent Kurdistan will not oppose their national interests. As a factor for stability, we have always wanted good neighborly relations based on mutual respect, understanding, and benefit. We are for building bridges and we can assure them that the future independent Kurdistan would be a partner and ally.\n\nWe want our neighbors and the whole world to understand that we have always stood for peace. Now the time has come for Erbil and Baghdad to be courageous enough to admit that we have failed and if we continue to insist on failure, we will not bring about a different outcome, therefore we believe that friends and partners should not insist on a failed one Iraq policy. In order to prevent future confrontations, we need to address this issue now. We need to be realistic to address it in such a way that it would bring about stability and security because the current situation is only a recipe for further violence and instability.\n\nRAI: After the independence of Kurdistan what relations will you pursue with Baghdad?\n\nMUSTAFA: We need to communicate with Baghdad, we need to ensure that they understand our ambitions and plans, and we do not want conflict with Baghdad, but we want friendship and partnership. We believe that we can become better partners as two sovereign states. Kurdistan can become Iraq's corridor in its relations with Turkey, Europe, and beyond. Likewise, Iraq can operate as Kurdistan's corridor in communicating with the Gulf Countries and beyond.\n\nIt will not be the end of the world when we decide that we cannot live together under one ceiling. Looking back at history, there are other nations that have accepted to be separate peacefully, through dialogue and now they enjoy very good relations. It's a fact of life that the Middle East region in the last hundred years had not seen stability and prosperity because of the wrong doings of the past, denial of identity, and lack of social justice.\n\nToday there is an opportunity for us to be courageous and to admit that we have failed in bringing about a genuine partnership, therefore engaging in a serious process of negotiations and communication with Baghdad is very important so that we communicate and, we don't make room for provocation because this is a national demand for the people of Kurdistan, not a political demand. We want Baghdad to be our partners in addressing this issue so we can do it in such a way that we secure a long term strong partnership with Baghdad. Our belief is that Baghdad is important today and tomorrow, and we seek good returns with Baghdad.\n\nRAI: What will be the governance structure of the proposed independent Kurdistan? Will it be a democratic secular republic?\n\nMUSTAFA: The decision about the future governance structure of Kurdistan will be decided during our planning period of the day-after referendum. The political parties with the rest of the communities here will work together in the establishment of a new form of governance. Most importantly, as a nation that strongly believes in democratic principles and adopt them as our core values; we will make sure that our government is a democratic and representative one. We will make sure to stand for an inclusive society adhering to rights of all the communities in Kurdistan. Religious, cultural, and educational rights of the different communities in Kurdistan will be respected. Learning from our past experiences, we want to build a society where all the communities are equal partners. Whether we decide to have a parliamentary, presidency, or hybrid system, will be dependent on our political agreements made the day-after. Nevertheless, principles of human rights, empowerment of youth and women, protection of minorities, etc... Will remain to be cornerstones for our governance. The good governance and transparency, values and principles will be enshrined in our constitution.\n\nRAI: How will the constitution of the Kurdistan be drafted? Will common people have a say?\n\nMUSTAFA: The draft-constitution we have for our region now was prepared by a committee then it went through the parliament, and then it was supposed to be approved by the people through a referendum. We will make sure that the people of Kurdistan have a say in their future constitution of Kurdistan.\n\nRAI: Will all Kurdish parties accept the outcome of this referendum?\n\nMUSTAFA: The referendum is a democratic process which is a practice for self-determination. All parties are obliged to respect the will of the people. There will be people who vote yes and there will be people voting no, both are acceptable in a democracy and the majority vote needs to be respected by all components of government. Examples of recent a referendum has been the Brexit one, which resulted in a very narrow margin between the yes and no votes.\n\nRAI: How will the issue of disputed territories between Irbil and Baghdad be solved?\n\nMUSTAFA: People of Kurdistan in areas outside KRG Administration as well as in the Diaspora will get a vote. This vote is a yes and no answer to the question \"Do you want an independent Kurdistan\". This vote is not to resolve the issues of the disputed territories. Baghdad's failure to implement Article 140 of the Constitution (which promised a referendum on future of these territories, among other things) leaves the issue of disputed territories in Iraq unresolved. However, KRG being a responsible government, will through peaceful constructive attempts of dialogue with Baghdad or a secondary referendum in the future, work on resolving the issues of disputed territories.\n\nRAI: Some Iraqi politicians especially Former Prime Minister Nuri Al Maliki declared this referendum unconstitutional. What is your reaction to this?\n\nMUSTAFA: The time when Iraq's politics began to take a wrong direction towards unilateral rule and instability was during Former Prime Minister Al Maliki's time. During Nawroz (March) 2012 my president sent an alarming alert to everyone in Iraq that political process of the country is taking the wrong direction. Unfortunately, no serious attention was paid to the presidents warning.\n\nOn the same note, Baghdad is unconstitutional regarding being responsible for not establishing the necessary institutions and laws for a healthy federal system. For instance, Baghdad is to be blamed for lack a Federal Council, a hydrocarbon law, a revenue sharing law, Status of the Peshmerga, resolving of article 140, etc. In addition to the breaches to the constitution, the budget of Kurdistan was cut. In the preamble of the constitution it is clearly stated that a commitment to this constitution is a guarantee for Iraq to remain united\u009d, therefore, adherence to constitution is a prerequisite for Iraq to be united. Unfortunately, despite our voluntary commitments to remain united, Baghdad breached the constitution on many occasions through exclusion of Sunni Arabs in the decision-making process arena, being hostile to the Kurds and minorities, among other marginalization attitudes and policies.", "time": "22:38:00"}

insist on holding the independence referendum set for Sept. 25, whereas Ankara remains resolute in objecting to Iraqi Kurdish independence.\n\n\"The Kurdish leadership has made that decision and there is no turning back,\" Barzani said in a recent interview with the al-Hayat daily. \"We don't want to repeat the failed experience of the last 100 years with Iraq, which is filled with tragedies. The neighboring countries must understand this and we've explained to them that we are a force for stability and security in the region.\"Despite Barzani's messages to Ankara to not harm ties due to the referendum, the Turkish government has not changed its position on the issue. \"We consider the referendum decision taken by the KRG as a step against the territorial integrity of Iraq,\" Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said in an interview with the T\u00fcrkiye daily.\n\nIn an attempt to soothe tensions with his increasingly uneasy neighbor, Barzani also said that the referendum \"does not mean war against any neighboring country. We seek good relations with them, especially Turkey.\"However, \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu asserted that insisting on holding an independence referendum would not be beneficial for the KRG or the Iraqi central government. \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said such a referendum would be likely to further destabilize the already crisis-stricken region.\n\nAnkara has not been alone in opposing the referendum. U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley expressed concern on the planned referendum last month, claiming that it could cause \"a distraction from urgent priorities.\" Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi also said that the upcoming Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum is not constitutional. Iran has also said that such a referendum would not be appropriate.\n\nThe KRG was created in 1970 in an agreement with the Iraqi government, putting years of fighting to an end. Later in 2005, it gained the right to autonomous governance in the constitution, but is still considered part of Iraq.Iraqi Kurdistan, with a population of about 5 million, enjoys a high degree of autonomy, including its own parliament and armed forces, but relations with the central government in Baghdad have nosedived in recent years over a range of issues. These include the sharing of oil revenues and control of some areas that are technically part of federal Iraq but have come under KRG control since 2014 during the war against Daesh.On Tuesday, a group of politicians, journalists and activists launched an opposition campaign in Sulaymaniyah, a city in Iraqi Kurdistan against the upcoming independence referendum. Speaking at a press conference, the NO for the Referendum movement's spokesman Reabun Maruf said that \"beginning from today, the NO campaign is officially launched.\"\"This referendum is not a step toward a just and a democratic stateOn the contrary, it is a very dangerous and historical mistake. The referendum would increase the discharge of those purposes as well as the division of the country. Not only will it not contribute to the cause of our public, but it would also result in the loss of both international and regional support,\" Maruf said.", "time": "21:35:00"}

"Iraqi govt: Issues between Iraq, Kurdistan could be tackled through dialogue\n\nBaghdad: The spokesman of the Iraqi government said the issues between the Iraq and the Kurdistan Region could be resolved through dialogue, as the region is planning to hold referendum on September 25. Spokesman Hadithi told NRT Arabic on Thursday that the Kurdistan Region's referendum is against the Iraqi constitution and that it will put the unity of Iraq in danger. There are issues in most of the countries and there are wills of solution, the spokesman said. All the Iraqi components can overcome the issues through agreement and consensus. Hadithi added a party must not alone determine the future of Iraq and that all the Iraqi individuals should play a role in resolving the issues. The referendum scheduled for September 25 has also concerned the United States, Britain, Russia, Germany and Iran as well as Turkey. nrttv.com\n\nKirkuk Turkmen cry foul in advance of Kurd region poll\n\nBaghdad: Kurdish militants in Kirkuk are tearing down banners critical of a planned referendum on the proposed secession of the northern Kurdish region from Iraq, the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) said Friday. A coalition of Turkmen parties and groups, the ITF is regarded as the main representative of Iraqi Turkmen in Iraq's parliament. \"The tearing down of anti-referendum banners -- which were put up by the Turkmen Nationalist Movement -- is an assault on free expression,\" the ITF said in a statement. \"The ITF reiterates its support for the Turkmen Nationalist Movement and its rejection of Iraq's dissolution,\" the statement read. \"Silencing opposing opinions and anti-referendum sentiment shows the lack of democratic practice in the referendum process,\" ITF member Hassan Salman told Anadolu Agency. \"If the KRG wants to hold a democratic referendum, it should allow all parties to express their opinions without hindrance,\" he added. aa.com.tr\n\nTurkey opens office in Duhok\n\nDuhok: Residents of Duhok in Iraqi Kurdistan region can now obtain Turkish visas without having to visit the Turkish Consulate General in Erbil, a Turkish official announced on Thursday. \"The number of visa applicants to Turkey from the Kurdistan Region is rising, especially in Duhok province located at the border,\" Mehmet Akif Inam, Turkish Consulate General in Erbil said on Thursday. He told Kurdistan 24 that the residents of Duhok could now apply for Turkish visas by visiting the newly opened visa-center in the city, meaning they no longer have to travel to Erbil and visit the Consulate General. Inam mentioned his government would continue to grant visas and facilitate exchanges with the people of the Kurdistan Region and Turkey. The Turkish Consul on Wednesday visited the city of Zakho in Duhok province. kurdpress.ir | Ekurd.net\n\nKurdish top diplomat hints at secondary referendum in disputed areas\n\nThe Kurdish top diplomat has hinted at a secondary referendum for the people in the disputed, or Kurdistani, areas after the independence referendum this September, adding that the issue could also be resolved through dialogue with Baghdad. Massoud Barzani had earlier suggested there may be a second referendum, too in these areas. The issue of the disputed areas, as defined by article 140 of the Iraqi constitution, that are claimed both by Erbil and Baghdad and include a province like Kirkuk has always been at the center of the disagreements between the two governments. Falah Mustafa, head of Kurdistan's Foreign Relations Department, told Asia Times that the September 25 referendum would not determine the fate of the disputed areas. \"This vote is not to resolve the issues of the disputed territories,\" Mustafa said in an interview published on Friday. rudaw.net", "time": "09:43:00"}

hold an independence referendum on September 25, noting that Iraq \"has failed to maintain a true partnership with the Kurdish people.\"\n\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday with Kurdish Muslim clerics in Erbil, Barzani said: \"The Kurds have long tried to establish a federal state in Iraq,\" adding that since 2003, the Iraqi government has violated around 55 articles of the Constitution, which was adopted by the people.\n\nHe also stressed that Kurdistan would never represent part of Iraq, \"if Baghdad continues to violate the Constitution,\" revealing that in 2004, the proportion of Kurds in the Army was 40 percent, while \"today it is zero\".\n\n\"The independence referendum is not the property of one person or one party, but belongs to the people of Kurdistan and all the Kurdish parties,\" Barzani said, adding that \"the Kurdish people have been subjected to genocide since the establishment of the Iraqi state in the 1920s.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barzani's media advisor, Kifah Mahmoud, told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper that the Kurdish leader has stressed that the decision to hold the referendum was not biased or personal, in reference to those who claim that the decision was solely made by the president and the Kurdistan Democratic Party.\n\nMahmoud pointed out that Barzani \"realizes the important role of religious scholars in support of the independence referendum, which is equal to the role of media, teachers in schools, and politicians.\"\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat is the world's premier pan-Arab daily newspaper, printed simultaneously each day on

Baba Gurgur oilfield, just outside Kirkuk, is a stark indication of the Iraqi Kurds' aspirations to establish an independent state with borders that stretch beyond their historic homeland to encompass some of Iraq's richest oilfields. A referendum on independence scheduled for September 25th will probably move the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) further down that path. But the timing of the poll has been questioned, not least because it is unclear what will come after. Some fear that a vote for independence will elicit violent responses from the government in Baghdad and from neighbouring countries.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan, which has enjoyed relative autonomy since 1991, already has many of the trappings of a sovereign country, including an army, a parliament and its own domain on the internet. After Baghdad withheld budget payments to the region in 2014, the KRG began selling its crude independently of the federal government. Its resources were further boosted months later after Iraq's federal army fled the oil region in and around Kirkuk when it was threatened by the jihadists of Islamic State (IS). The job of repelling IS then fell to Kurdish militias, known as the peshmerga, who did it bravely and well.\n\nEven so, some Kurds argue that a bid for independence is premature. \"Beforehand we need to have Kurdish unity and some sort of an understanding with Baghdad,\" says Mahmoud Othman, a veteran politician. \"We do not have either.\" The peshmerga is a unified force only on paper. Its fighters' loyalties are divided between the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the opposition Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Parliament has not convened since 2015, when Masoud Barzani, the president, had his term extended for a second time, prompting violent protests and political deadlock. Some see the referendum as an attempt by the KDP to shore up nationalist support ahead of elections in November.\n\nThe economy is also in a shambles. Revenue from oil is much less than the 17% share of Iraq's budget to which the KRG was entitled before its relationship with the federal government broke down. So the Kurdish government is short of cash. Firms that poured into the region in the 2000s have been pouring out. The KRG blames the crisis on cheap oil and the high cost of fighting IS and hosting some 1.8m refugees. Critics also blame official incompetence and corruption.\n\nAnother question revolves around Kirkuk, which has a Kurdish majority but is also home to Arabs and Turkmen and is prized by all because of its oil. The KRG has long accused Baghdad of flouting a constitutional provision that calls for a local vote on the province's status. By including Kirkuk in the referendum next month, it hopes to legitimise its claim over the territory. \"If the people say yes, it means they are deciding to be part of Kurdistan,\" says Rebwar Talabani, the head of Kirkuk's provincial council. But many non-Kurdish residents are planning to boycott the vote. \"We will not recognise any result,\" says Hassan Toran, an Iraqi Turkmen MP. \"Our future is in Iraq.\"\n\nWinning over regional powers will be even harder. Turkey has cracked down on home-grown Kurdish militants and has carried out air strikes on Kurdish forces in Syria. It opposes the formation of an independent Kurdish state in Iraq lest it encourage separatists at home. Iran appears even more hostile to such a move, largely for similar reasons. Even the Kurds' closest allies are urging them to postpone the vote. America worries it will lead to turmoil in the rest of Iraq, weakening the country's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, and compromising the war against IS.\n\nKRG leaders say they are in no hurry to declare independence, but they do plan to head to Baghdad after the vote to hammer out the terms of the divorce. It will not be amicable. Mr Abadi's government will not sanction what it sees as a grab for oil and land, particularly Kirkuk. \"There is a risk that the Arabs, the Turkmen and the Shia will protest and that Baghdad, backed by Iran, will send in militias or security forces,\" says Joost Hiltermann of the International Crisis Group, a think-tank.\n\nSome analysts think Mr Barzani will postpone the referendum at the last minute. But Kurdish politicians are growing impatient. \"We cannot wait for the right time [for independence], we have to create the right time,\" says Safeen Dizayee, the KRG's spokesperson.", "time": "17:44:00"}

(Fox News/Hollie McKay)\n\nAs Iraqi Kurds count down the weeks until their landmark independence referendum, U.S. and Baghdad officials are warning the non-binding vote could be undermine the fight against ISIS.\n\nKurds, concentrated in the northern part of the war torn nation, maintain a semi-autonomous region that relies on funding from Baghdad. The Kurds, who number nearly 6 million in Iraq, have been instrumental in the battle to expel ISIS from its stronghold of Mosul and surrounding cities and villages, working with both Baghdad and the U.S. The vote for independence is set for Sept. 25.\n\n\"The referendum is going to be held because of Kurdish people's intense heartiness for being independent.\"\n\n- Sami Ergoshi, spokesman for Kurdish Prime Minister Masoud Barzani\n\n\"The Iraqi Kurdistan Government is a strategic partner in our common fight against ISIS in Iraq. That being said, the U.S. continues to support a federal, prosperous, unified and democratic Iraq. We do not support a referendum at this time,\" a State Department official told Fox News this week. \"A referendum now, even this non-binding one, could have catastrophic consequences for Baghdad-Erbil cooperation that is essential to defeat ISIS.\"\n\nCommunication between Baghdad's Iraqi Forces and the Kurdish capital Erbil's Peshmerga to defeat ISIS - which still holds some 30 percent of the total territory it once controlled inside Iraq - is crucial. Yet, the Baghdad and Kurdish governments are still themselves at odds over vast swaths of disputed land.\n\n\"Finally, things appear to be going right between the two - fighting a common enemy, and doing it well. So why destroy relations now? There is a real concern this referendum will be disruptive, raise the temperature in the whole region and lead to a land grab,\" one high-ranking Iraqi official, who requested not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media, told Fox News. \"The disputed territories must be handled first.\"\n\nKey areas in the country, including parts of Kirkuk and Nineveh Governorates, are among these contested areas. Furthermore, critics say, the Kurdish government does not currently have a functioning parliament - given it was suspended almost two years ago after President Masoud Barzani's term ended - but he declined to step down given the crisis of the then-burgeoning ISIS.\n\nThe referendum also poses regional and international concerns. Turkey has already warned that holding the referendum will be a \"grave mistake,\" and Iran has been very vocal in its position that the disintegration of its neighbor will spell \"danger\" for the region as a whole.\n\n\"Kurdistan will need at least 10 years of U.S. support to sustain its affairs,\" projected Ammar Kadhim Alshiby al Amry, a ranking parliament member representing State of Law bloc - the bloc aligned with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. \"Kurds in Turkey and Iran and Syria will find strength in this referendum to ask for a similar move in their countries.\"\n\nAnd even though the September referendum is expected to be met with a resounding yes in favor of independence, it does not instantly mean that a unilateral secession will take place. Rather, it is likely to function as a potent negotiating tool with Baghdad and other international powers on the issue.\n\nISIS, SQUEEZED OUT OF IRAQ AND SYRIA, NOW 'REGROUPING' IN LIBYA, ANALYSTS SAY\n\nHOW ISIS USES HUMAN SHIELDS IN FIGHTING COALITION FORCES\n\nBut despite the U.S, Baghdad and much international opposition, the Kurds are standing strong and officials told Fox News that it will not be delayed.\n\n\"The referendum is going to be held because of Kurdish people's intense heartiness for being independent. Kurds, including all ethnic and minority groups, believe that an independent Kurdistan is the end of all sorrows and persecution which has historically been done against the Kurds,\" Sami Ergoshi, spokesman for the KRG Prime Minister told Fox News.\n\nKurish suffering under the reign of Saddam Hussein, who used chemical weapons against them in 1988, together with their instrumental role in fighting ISIS, has instilled a feeling among them that they have earned their independence - and U.S. support.\n\n\"When ISIS was knocking at their door on the border, the Kurds fought for their homeland. They have sacrificed a lot,\" said Luke Coffey, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundationhe said. \"They have proven a dependable ally to the United States.\"\n\nHollie McKay has been a FoxNews.com staff reporter since 2007.

A referendum on independence scheduled for September 25th will probably move the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) further down that path. But the timing of the poll has been questioned, not least because it is unclear what will come after. Some fear that a vote for independence will elicit violent responses from the government in Baghdad and from neighbouring countries.\n\nIraqi Kurdistan, which has enjoyed relative autonomy since 1991, already has many of the trappings of a sovereign country, including an army, a parliament and its own domain on the internet. After Baghdad withheld budget payments to the region in 2014, the KRG began selling its crude independently of the federal government. Its resources were further boosted months later after Iraq's federal army fled the oil region in and around Kirkuk when it was threatened by the jihadists of Islamic State (IS). The job of repelling IS then fell to Kurdish militias, known as the peshmerga, who did it bravely and well.\n\nEven so, some Kurds argue that a bid for independence is premature. \"Beforehand we need to have Kurdish unity and some sort of an understanding with Baghdad,\" says Mahmoud Othman, a veteran politician. \"We do not have either.\" The peshmerga is a unified force only on paper. Its fighters' loyalties are divided between the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the opposition Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Parliament has not convened since 2015, when Masoud Barzani, the president, had his term extended for a second time, prompting violent protests and political deadlock. Some see the referendum as an attempt by the KDP to shore up nationalist support ahead of elections in November.", "time": "17:28:00"}

in Sweden are urging their government to welcome Kurdistan Region's decision to hold an independence referendum in September, citing the failed Iraqi government, Kurdistan's protection of minority groups, and the right to self-determination under international law.\n\n\"We liberals see that Iraq has become a so-called failed state and we think it would be better for all of its entities if Iraq and Kurdistan went separate ways such as Czechoslovakia in 1992 were divided into both the Czech Republic and Slovakia,\" reads the collaborative statement co-signed by eight Swedish politicians.\n\nThe opinion article was first published in Svenska Dagbladet, a daily newspaper. The politicians believe a peaceful separation from Iraq is a practical one.\n\n\"If the people of Iraq cannot coexist within one and the same national boundary, they should, for democratic reasons, be able to proclaim independence and then live as good neighbors,\" it read.\n\nThey argued \"The central government has repeatedly shown inability to provide protection and care for the whole country. The new Iraq has been shown to pursue the same pan-Arabic policy towards Kurdistan that has always and undeniably failed.\"\n\nThe politicians highlight the defense of the Kurdistan Region against ISIS militants \"by a multicultural Peshmerga,\" pointing out the protection of minority groups in Nineveh province including Assyrians, Syriacs and Chaldeans, who also \"should be given the right to self-government.\"\n\nThey say they are optimistic about the future of various groups in Kurdistan, which has hosted more than 1.5 million displaced Iraqis since 2014.\n\n\"We look forward to a Kurdistan where the various ethnic and religious groups continue to live in unity and with fundamental rights just as they do today in the autonomous region,\" read the article.\n\nThe Swedes believe that \"the right to self-determination is central.\"\n\n\"We all shall be entitled to decide on our own future,\" they added. \"There are principles under international law and we support the Kurds' right to self-determination and the process that ensures this.\"\n\nLiberal support in Sweden for Kurdistan is deeply rooted, the politicians noted, citing expressed support and work by their party since 2010.\n\n\"Liberals have a long tradition of solidarity with the people of Kurdistan, and we therefore welcome the outcome of the referendum and look forward to the fact that the world is gaining a new state and the Middle East another democratic state,\" they concluded.\n\nThe op-ed was co-signed by the Swedish Liberals Birgitta Ohlsson (MP, Foreign Policy Spokesman); Cecilia Wikstr\u00f6m (European MP); Fredrik Malm (MP, Migration Policy Spokesman); Maria Leissner (Ambassador and former Party Chairperson); Olle Schmidt (Substitute city council in Malm\u00f6, former MEP and vice president of ALDE); Joar Forssell (Federal Chairman of the Liberal Youth League, Sukr\u00ee Demir (2nd Vice Chairman of the International Committee of Solna); Sirwan Dabagh (Preparation for Democracy, Equality & Human Rights, Malm\u00f6).\n\nTranslations by Biza Barzo", "time": "16:41:00"}

Let me tell you because I know from experience. As an American, coming to Kurdistan in Iraq after graduating from college in December 2016 for my first real job, things were less than certain. Based in Erbil, I had no idea what the future was going to hold for me. Despite the uncertainty and not knowing what lay ahead, the positive atmosphere and welcoming vibes of Kurdistan reassured me that everything was going to be ok.\n\nDespite armed groups being within an hour's drive from Erbil and war raging throughout the rest of Iraq, Kurdistan always felt safe to me. Not one time, since having been here for over eight months, have I ever felt unsafe in the capital of the Kurdistan Region. No matter what my situation was, a local was always there to help me if needed. This feeling of being welcomed and at times has led me to stay here and continue my career in the humanitarian field.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kurdistan is how open it is. It is a place where you can be yourself, even if your cultural upbringing is much different from that of the local population. When I tell locals that I work for an NGO in the humanitarian field, everyone is so interested and happy to hear I am helping other people, both Kurds and Iraqis, even though there may be animosity between them. People are so accepting even if your religious views, life views, or political opinions are different from theirs. This is something you wouldn't expect coming to the northern region of Iraq in such an unpredictable and unstable time in history.\n\nLiving in Erbil has really been a treat for me. I have made so many contacts, met so many new faces, and I have connected with local people as well as those from all over the world. Just an hour outside of Erbil, you can swim in some of the bluest waters, hike through amazing mountains, and make it back to the city before it gets dark to enjoy a cold beer in the local bar. Even when returning from areas outside of Kurdish control, I feel like I am coming home, to a safe place, when I cross the last military checkpoint heading back to Kirkuk, Erbil, or Duhok.\n\nI love the smiles on the faces of the Peshmerga when I greet them and speak to them briefly in Kurdish at checkpoints. It's really a great feeling in such a far off part of the world. I have always enjoyed the respectful nature of how you introduce yourself and greet someone here. Even more wonderful is how if you shake one hand out of the group, you have to shake everyone else's. But my favorite is the two or three quick kisses on the cheek when you greet someone. This is something so different from anything I have experienced in America but it has grown on me and I have become more comfortable with it as my time here in Kurdistan continues.\n\nWhile Kurdistan may be unknown to many in the West, nothing can compare to the safety and uniqueness of this place. It truly is a rose among the thorns, especially in today's ever changing political context. Even while hosting IDPs and refugees, and suffering from the drop in the price of oil, Kurdistan has still kept its doors open to investment, outsiders, and in turn, the world. It really is a special feeling to be here in such a fragile and complex time in history. I always wonder, when driving through Erbil, what the next ten years will hold for such an amazing and unique place that I have called my home for the past eight months.\n\nYour average American will only hear Kurdistan in the news alongside images of war and destruction.

planned referendum on region's secession from Iraq\n\nKurdish militants in Kirkuk are tearing down banners critical of a planned referendum on the proposed secession of the northern Kurdish region from Iraq, the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) said Friday.\n\nA coalition of Turkmen parties and groups, the ITF is regarded as the main representative of Iraqi Turkmen in Iraq's parliament.\n\n\"The tearing down of anti-referendum banners -- which were put up by the Turkmen Nationalist Movement -- is an assault on free expression,\" the ITF said in a statement.\n\n\"The ITF reiterates its support for the Turkmen Nationalist Movement and its rejection of Iraq's dissolution,\" the statement read.\n\nThe ethnically-diverse city of Kirkuk remains the subject of dispute between northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) and Iraq's central government in Baghdad.\n\n\"Silencing opposing opinions and anti-referendum sentiment shows the lack of democratic practice in the referendum process,\" ITF member Hassan Salman said.\n\n\"If the KRG wants to hold a democratic referendum, it should allow all parties to express their opinions without hindrance,\" he added.\n\nThe non-binding referendum, in which residents of the Kurdish region will vote on whether or not to formally secede from the Iraqi state, is currently slated for Sept. 25.\n\nBaghdad, however, rejects the planned poll, saying it could adversely affect the region's ongoing fight against the ISIL terrorist group.\n\nThe Iraqi government also claims that the poll would violate Iraq's 2005 constitution and would be \"of no political or economic benefit to the region's Kurds\".\n\nTurkey, too, rejects the planned referendum, saying that maintenance of Iraq's territorial integrity is inextricably linked to the region's stability.\n\nThe U.S., for its part, has likewise expressed concern that the referendum would serve as a \"distraction\" from other pressing regional issues, especially the fight against terrorism and the stabilization of war-weary Iraq.", "time": "00:24:00"}

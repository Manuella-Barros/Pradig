The England Under-21 international joined the Clarets from Mancehster City last summer but was unable to prevent Vincent Kompany\u2019s now former side avoid relegation. Trafford\u2019s form deteriorated during the second half of a difficult campaign and was ultimately replaced by Arijanet Muric during the run-in. A further setback for the 21-year-old arrived earlier this week when Gareth Southgate opted to omit Trafford from his final squad of 26 players ahead of the upcoming European Championships. Despite a testing six months, Trafford is still regarded as one of English football\u2019s most exciting goalkeeping talents. Newcastle are keen to strengthen in that department this summer having been forced to contend without Nick Pope for much of last season. Pope, a former Burnley goalkeeper himself, has damaged his shoulder significantly twice in recent years and Eddie Howe is keen to sign top class competition for one of his key players. The Magpies had been strongly linked with a move for Arsenal\u2019s out of favour Aaron Ramsdale but, according to the Daily Mail, have been put off by the the Gunners\u2019 valuation. James Trafford was cut from the England squad earlier this week (Picture: Getty) Aaron Ramsdale played for England last night and has been linked with a move to Newcastle (Picture: Getty) Arsenal had hoped to recoup a large chunk of the \u00a325m they spent on Ramsdale three years ago when they opted to move for the ex-Sheffield United No.1 Should Arsenal fail to receive a suitable offer this summer, they will consider a season-long loan move for the 26-year-old who is firmly behind David Raya in Mikel Arteta\u2019s pecking order. Arteta, meanwhile, is also prepared to listen to offers for a number of squad players who have fallen out of favour. Hale End Academy graduates Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson are all likely to move on. Nketiah is understood to have attracted interest from four Premier League clubs, while Smith Rowe has been heavily coveted by Aston Villa in the past where his former manager, Uani Emery, has just signed a new long-term contract. Thomas Partey is also likely to depart this summer, while fellow experienced midfielder, Moahamed Elneny, left the club earlier this week after eight years following the expiration of his contract.

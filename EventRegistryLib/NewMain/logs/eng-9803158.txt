The incident occurred in Vidya Nagar on Thursday evening, leaving the city in shock.\n\nThe woman, identified as Begum and believed to be in her mid-50s, was attempting to board a Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TGSRTC) bus bound for Dilsukhnagar. As the bus approached the Vidya Nagar bus stop near NCC X Road, Begum signaled for the driver to stop. However, the driver, who was making a turn, did not halt immediately, which infuriated her.\n\nIn a fit of rage, Begum hurled a liquor bottle at the bus, shattering the rear windshield. The commotion prompted the driver to stop the vehicle. As passengers and the conductor rushed to confront her, Begum escalated the situation by pulling out a live snake from her bag and throwing it at the conductor.\n\nThe snake caused panic among those nearby but it slithered away and disappeared into the roadside. In the incident, the conductor escaped unharmed, but the incident led to a traffic jam in the busy area as onlookers scrambled to capture videos and photos of the unusual scene.\n\nTGSRTC Managing Director V.C. Sajjanar expressed deep concern over the incident, condemning such attacks on public transport staff and property. \"It is distressing to witness such actions. We urge passengers to refrain from such behavior, and we will ensure that strict action is taken with the help of the police,\" Sajjanar stated.\n\nThe Nallakunta police were quick to respond, registering a case against Begum. According to Nallakunta SHO Jagadishwar Rao, the woman was apprehended and is currently being questioned to determine the motive behind her actions, particularly why she was carrying a snake in her bag.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana_State_Road_Transport_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telangana State Road Transport Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilsukhnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dilsukhnagar"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nallakunta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nallakunta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/09/6fb92b3f815b0c089c481525225f8e021723181518449240_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803158", "eventUri": "eng-9803158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

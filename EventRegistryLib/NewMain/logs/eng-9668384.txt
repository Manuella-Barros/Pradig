Thanks to teammate Jaylen Warren and his wild idea back in May, it seems even EA Sports wanted to have some fun in the action. Without further ado, let's take a look at the trailer.\n\nMadden 25 Reveal Trailer Shows Steelers' QB Justin Fields Returning Kicks\n\nThe EA Sports Madden 25 Reveal Trailer, released earlier today, shows a clip of Pittsburgh Steelers' QB Justin Fields performing a kick return. Fields, who wears the #2 on his new team, can be seen in the trailer just a few seconds in, where he returns a kick sent from Browns kicker Dustin Hopkins. Furthermore, the trailer even shows off the new 2024 NFL Kick-off rules, which begin this season.\n\nThe whole Justin Fields kick-off return story began back in May when Steelers' RB Jaylen Warren mentioned how the Steelers might use Fields in some interesting ways. \"Our special teams coordinator was talking about Justin Fields being back there,\" Warren said. \"We looked at him like 'Justin Fields about to be back there?' and I don't know I think it's cool.\"\n\nOf course, Fields shut down that rumor later on down the line. \"Nah, I think everybody kind of interpreted it wrong,\" Fields said. \"Coach Danny was basically just trying to send a message that no matter who you are, you could be on special teams. He just used that as an example.\" While Fields thought it was funny to see all the reactions, he made it clear that he is a QB, and nothing else.\n\nBut perhaps the Steelers might have multiple ways to use the 25 year old speedster. The Chicago Bears originally drafted him 11th overall in 2021 NFL Draft. After three rough seasons, the team decided to trade Fields as they set sights on the new No 1. overall pick, Caleb Williams. The Steelers traded for fields in March, where he'll be the backup QB under veteran Russell Wilson.\n\nOverall, there are a variety of ways the Steelers could use someone with Fields' skill-set. Even if Wilson starts, Fields could still see playing time while under Wilson's tutelage. Furthermore, Wilson could also struggle this year, leaving an opportunity for Fields to step in. Regardless, it'll be interesting to watch the Steelers' QB room over the course of the year, and see what happens. We hope to see the former Buckeye make a nice comeback into the NFL.\n\nBut of course, now we look forward to actually returning kicks with Justin Fields in Madden 25. We imagine he'd make for a great returner, and a possible game-breaker if used correctly. With his size, speed, and strength, Fields makes for a great player to use in modes like Franchise. You'll get a chance to take him places when Madden 25 releases this August.\n\nAnyway, feel free to check out the Madden 25 Reveal Trailer. This year's installment sees improvements to Franchise, Presentation, and tackling thanks to the new BOOM Tech on next-gen. However, we're cautiously optimistic for the next Madden title, which does seem to make some cool changes like a returning team builder mode. And of course, with College Football 25 on the way, there's hopefully more urgency to make a better Madden title.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "massimo_marchiano@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Massimo Marchiano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Masters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Masters", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Madden-25-reveal-trailer-gives-nod-to-viral-Justin-Fields-kickoff-suggestion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

It was the player receiving the opening kickoff to start the trailer -- Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nThe trailer began with a contest between the Browns and the Steelers. Cleveland booted the ball away to begin the action, and it's No. 2 -- Fields -- who received the ball out of the air and took it up field. Eventually, he handed it off to Pittsburgh' newest special teams weapon, Cordarrelle Patterson.\n\nThe clip may confuse some people considering it's a quarterback acting as a kick returner. But to those that have been paying attention to the offseason rumors in the Steel City, it's a call back to a quote from Steelers running back Jaylen Warren about Fields potentially taking kick returns in his first year as a Steeler.\n\nMORE: When does Madden 25 come out? Everything to know about latest NFL game\n\nThe speculation around Fields acting as a special teams member started when Warren disclosed a conversation that special teams coordinator Danny Smith had with the team. Smith said that he was considering putting Fields back there to catch punts and return them, according to the Pittsburgh running back.\n\n\"Our special teams coordinator was talking about Justin Fields being back there,\" Warren said when discussing the new kickoff rules. \"We were like, 'Hold up! Hold up!'\"\n\nOf course, everyone wanted to know what the newest member of Pittsburgh's QB room thought of the potential plans to put him out on kick returns. Unsurprisingly, Fields shut down that idea altogether.\n\n\"Nah, I think everybody kind of interpreted it wrong,\" Fields said, per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"Coach Danny was basically just trying to send a message that no matter who you are, you could be on special teams. He just used that as an example.\"\n\nFields never took the suggestion seriously. His focus is working on competing with Russell Wilson to earn the No. 1 job on the Steelers, but he did see it take the internet by storm.\n\n\"It's funny how serious social media takes everything,\" Fields said. \"It was kind of funny to me when everybody was making a big deal about it for no reason.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordarrelle_Patterson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cordarrelle Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Post-Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/Justin%20Fields%20062024.jpg?itok=B12LkAIj", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Heck, even in the lead-up to the 2021 NFL Draft, there were a lot of things that were said about Fields as people will always try to tear guys down before they even get a chance to play. Things didn't go as everyone had hoped with Fields in Chicago, and both fans and pundits alike have made that very well-known.\n\nFields was traded in the 2024 offseason to the Pittsburgh Steelers where it seems like he's currently capped as being Russell Wilson's backup. There have been rumors floated around throughout the course of the offseason that Fields' athletic traits could be used in some way by the Steelers, including a hysterical idea bout him returning kickoffs.\n\nThis was a rumor that was hopefully never meant to be taken seriously. Although Fields would probably do whatever it takes to help the team win, the Steelers have added return specialists to the roster like Cordarrelle Patterson, Quez Watkins, and Calvin Austin III deliberately. The idea of Fields actually returning kicks is a silly one.\n\nNot silly enough, however, for the creators of Madden 25 to include Fields returning a kickoff as the literal first scene of their big trailer for the upcoming video game release.\n\nThis is taking the disrespect of an individual player way too far.\n\nThe creators of the Madden 25 video game did something kind of funny by having Christian McCaffrey running away from a bunch of Raiders players on the cover art. That's all good in the scope of fandom and spirit of competition. But having Fields return a kickoff in the first scene of the game's trailer is over the top disrespect.\n\nFrankly, it's hard to believe it was actually approved.\n\nFans responding to the trailer on Twitter/X are expressing their outrage as well. Justin Fields is a young player trying to make his way in the league and bounce back after a tough start to his career. There are few players who would have excelled in the environment Fields was placed in, and he showed some nice things in spite of that.\n\nThe reality is that Fields is a reclamation project for the Steelers.

Now some fans may be laughing right back, as EA Sports' newest trailer for the upcoming \"Madden NFL 25\" kicks off with none other than Fields ... returning kicks.\n\nThe Steelers are playing the rival Cleveland Browns in the opening of the trailer, and within seconds, Dustin Hopkins boots the ball into the waiting arms of Fields, who's sporting his new No. 2 Steelers jersey and quickly pulls off a reverse handoff to new Steelers return specialist Cordarelle Patterson.\n\nIs it a playful jab, or a sign of what's to come? It depends on who you listen to. Steelers running back Jaylen Warren first indicated in May that special teams coordinator Danny Smith \"was talking about Justin Fields being back there\" as a return man, thanks to the NFL's new rules re-incentivizing kick returns.

Wilson, who joined the team on a one-year deal in March, has maintained \"pole position\" in the battle since Fields' arrival, per head coach Mike Tomlin.

But the folks over at EA Sports and Madden 25 are imagining what it would look like. The debut trailer for the newest Madden dropped Thursday morning. The first clip shows the Cleveland Browns kicking off to the Steelers. And it's Fields back there to return.\n\nIn the video, he fields the kick and hands it off to Cordarrelle Patterson on a reverse.\n\nUnfortunately, that's as far as we see the play go. I'll just pretend Patterson took this one to the house.\n\nFields has been rumored as a return man ever since RB Jaylen Warren mentioned the possibility in a conversation on Cam Heyward's Not Just Football podcast. The team has downplayed the idea, Special Teams Coordinator Danny Smith calling it a \"storyline,\" though he didn't outright deny using Fields back there.\n\nUnder the new kickoff rules, two players must be in the \"landing zone\" to field the kick. Arguably the greatest returner in NFL history, Patterson will be one. But it's not clear which Steeler will stand opposite him. Funny enough, it could be Warren instead of Fields. If kickoffs are now treated like a running play, Warren's bowling ball demeanor with his explosiveness makes him a threat with the ball in his hands and some runway. Other options include WRs Calvin Austin III and Quez Watkins.\n\nThe only Steelers' quarterback returning kicks this spring was fourth-string rookie John Rhys Plumlee. A tremendous athlete who played baseball and football throughout college, he figures to at least be in the return lines at training camp. Whether or not he's used in a preseason game remains to be seen.\n\nIn addition to Fields, T.J. Watt is briefly shown in Madden's trailer making a big sideline hit on Atlanta Falcons WR Drake London. Those two teams will square off to open the season.\n\nNew to Madden 25 is their \"Boom Tech\" and updated hit stick along with new AI Logic and catch animations. Franchise Mode has also reportedly received refreshed storylines though the mode has underwhelmed for years. Madden has come under intense criticism for a sub-par product and now competes with College Football 25, set to be released next month.\n\nMadden 25 is available August 16.\n\nRelated Items:Justin Fields, Madden 25, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you ESPN Columnist Thinks Steelers Should Reunite With CB Ahkello Witherspoon Doug Whaley Questions How Much Longer T.J.

After the Denver Broncos gave QB Russell Wilson permission to meet with teams before his release, he visited the Steelers and agreed to a new contract. That triggered a run of events that saw QB Kenny Pickett traded to the Philadelphia Eagles and then the Steelers acquired Justin Fields from the Chicago Bears.\n\nTo say that a lot happened in a week is an understatement. While the results remain to be seen, few people would argue that the Steelers did not improve at the most important position in football. But if the Steelers had known what the price tag on Fields was earlier, could it have changed how things went down in March?\n\n\"I believe that if you gave the Steelers truth serum, they'll never admit this nor should they,\" ESPN's Mike Greenberg said on Thursday's episode of Get Up. \"But if they had known at the time that they were going to be able to get Justin Fields for the price that they got him for, I don't think they would have signed Russell in the first place.\"\n\nGreenberg believes that the Steelers signed Wilson because the asking price from the Bears was still too high, so they went to Plan B. Then the asking price changed.\n\n\"I think that was at a moment in time when the asking price on Justin Fields was this and the Steelers decided we're not meeting that price,\" Greenberg said as he raised his hand over his head before dropping it down to his side. \"If they had known that it was eventually get to be this, I think they would have [traded for] him and they would have given him every chance to be their starter.\"\n\nHow different would things have been if the Steelers and Bears had been able to agree on the same trade just a week or two earlier? Would Wilson still have visited Pittsburgh and signed as a free agent?\n\nWould the Steelers be staring down the barrel of a potential quarterback controversy?\n\nMaybe not. The old football saying is that if you have two quarterbacks, you have none. That's what former Steelers front office executive Doug Whaley thinks, saying last Wednesday that the Steelers don't truly have a quarterback and are just hoping that one or both of them will develop into a quality starting option.\n\nSo if the Steelers had traded for Fields sooner, perhaps they would not have reached out to Wilson. Maybe they would have simply invested their time and energy into giving Fields a platform to succeed.\n\nHowever, there's also the matter of Pickett. Would Pickett have reacted as negatively to a Fields trade as the Wilson signing? Perhaps he would have stuck it out in Pittsburgh. So would the Steelers still have had a controversy, just with Fields and Pickett rather than Wilson and Fields?\n\nIt's all speculation at this point. We do know that head coach Mike Tomlin is a big fan of Justin Fields and that means a lot for a former first-round quarterback looking to restart his career.\n\nAnd we know that once the Steelers head for St Vincent College, Wilson will be in \"pole position\" at training camp. Whether he is the starter Week 1 or for the entirety of the 2024 season remains to be seen.\n\nRelated Items:Get Up, Justin Fields, Mike Greenberg, Pittsburgh Steelers, Russell Wilson Recommended for you Watch: Justin Fields Returns Kickoff In New Madden 25 Trailer ESPN Columnist Thinks Steelers Should Reunite With CB Ahkello Witherspoon Doug Whaley Questions How Much Longer T.J.

The game looks more realistic than ever, advertised as showcasing \"physics-based tackling, true-to-life player behaviors,\"\n\nThe opening clip highlighting those new features? A kickoff from the Cleveland Browns to the Pittsburgh Steelers -- a tried and true rivalry and AFC North battle worthy of the feature. The only problem? Steelers quarterback Justin Fields was returning the kickoff.\n\nThe idea of Fields returning kicks has floated around the league since running back Jaylen Warren posed the idea while interviewing on Cam Heyward's podcast this offseason. It was more of a joke than anything else, with Fields later noting to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \"Nah, I'm not here to do that. It was kind of a joke, to be honest with you.\" He expanded:\n\n\"Nah, I think everybody kind of interpreted it wrong,\" Fields said Tuesday at his locker. \"Coach Danny was basically just trying to send a message that no matter who you are, you could be on special teams. He just used that as an example.\"\n\nNonetheless, Madden 25 took the opportunity to poke fun at the idea, featuring Fields returning kicks in their game's trailer. All in good fun, one hopes. There's no doubt that the Steelers should be looking to design specific packages for Fields on offense given his upside as a runner.\n\nSince 2020, Fields leads all NFL quarterbacks with 1,908 regular season rushing yards, including 12 rushing touchdowns and a whopping 62.8% of those rushing yards coming after first contact (2nd-highest percentage among QBs with 100+ rush attempts in that span). He also leads that cohort with both his 6.5 yards per carry average and 4.1 yards after contact per attempt.\n\nSo yeah, it wouldn't make a lot of sense not to find a way to incorporate that into the game plan, similar to what the Saints have done with QB/TE/do-it-all guy Taysom Hill. It just won't be in the kick return game.

Fans have been interested in if Fields will return kickoffs ever since running back Jaylen Warren let it be known special teams coordinator Danny Smith broached the possibility during a meeting.\n\nWas it a prescient sign of things to come, or a (not so) inside joke?\n\nMost likely, just a brilliant piece of marketing for extra exposure.\n\nWhatever the reason, video game maker EA Sports' newest social-media promotion for its popular Madden football game features Justin Fields retuning a kickoff.\n\nThe 84-second video, posted on X (formerly Twitter) begins with a \"Madden 25\" kickoff scene at Cleveland Browns Stadium. Browns kicker Dustin Hopkins boots the ball deep, where Fields - a quarterback - catches it.\n\nFields quickly, however, turns to his right for a reverse-style handoff to Cordarrelle Patterson. A free-agent addition soon after the NFL announced its new kickoff format for 2024, Patterson holds the NFL record for most career kick return touchdowns.\n\nThat new rule - intended to revive the kick return as a frequent and exciting part of the game - has led to great speculation about how teams will approach it.\n\nWill different types of returners be used? Will the body types of those covering kicks change? What strategies will be deployed by special-teams coordinators?\n\nBesides that the Kansas City Chiefs are considering not even using a kicker to kick off, among the more bizarre (and fascinating) ideas floated was that the Steelers would send Fields back to return kickoffs.\n\nIt was sent into the NFL internet ether by Steelers running back Jaylen Warren (of all people) during an appearance last month on Cameron Heyward's podcast \"Not Just Football.\"\n\n\"Our special teams coordinator was talking about Justin Fields being back there,\" Warren said. \"We looked at him like, 'Justin Fields will be back there??!!'

But, Madden will once again release an annual title, \"Madden 25\", this August.\n\nThe trailer for the newest edition of the best-selling sports video game series of all-time came out on Thursday, and it featured a hilarious troll of Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nFields' time in Chicago is over after three seasons of high expectations and mediocre results from the 11th-overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, as they shipped him to the Steelers this offseason for mid-round draft compensation. He's expected to back up Russell Wilson.\n\nBut, a few months ago, there was some speculation that Justin Fields could be deployed as a kick returner for the Pittsburgh Steelers. New kickoff rules this season are putting a premium on kick returners, and Fields is definitely very shifty with the ball.\n\nBut, for obvious reasons, having a backup quarterback as a kick returner was pretty quickly shot down by those around the organization. That didn't stop Madden from trolling Justin Fields by showing him as a kick returner in their trailer. Take a look.\n\nThat's a tough look for Justin Fields, who has reasonable hopes of becoming a starting quarterback again in the league. It's not as if he was the worst quarterback in the league or anything. Had the Bears not had the first-overall pick to select Caleb Williams this year due to a trade with the Panthers that involved the first-overall pick in 2023, they likely would've given him another year.\n\nAt 25-years old, I'm sure Justin Fields takes offense to the fact that people are laughing about him being a kick returner on Madden.

However, once Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jaylen Warren revealed in May that Fields was discussed as a possible kickoff return man, many NFL fans have believed that we'll see the quarterback take on that special teams duty.\n\nIt'd be surreal to see a guy who was drafted 11th overall to be an eventual franchise QB drop back deep for kicks. With new NFL rules, though, and Fields' dynamic skill set in the open field as a runner, it makes a lot of sense. Madden 25 gave us a brief, fleeting look at what Fields might look like in a new role.\n\nMutual X/Twitter follower Kyle Brandt does a great job breaking down all the new features, which makes it seem like Madden 25 isn't a glorified roster update with minor tweaks to the gameplay experience. Since College Football 25 is roaring back after such a lengthy hiatus, EA Sports probably figured it was best to up its game a bit with the Madden franchise. Sure looks like that's the case here.\n\nNew technology called \"BOOM Tech\" will give Madden gamers the most realistic tackling to date. That's really cool, since the animations for on-field collisions can be rather repetitive and oversimplified. It's neat, too, to have a superior variety of player behavior, juke moves, and generally better physics to make the simulation at least a little more life-like.\n\nBut not to be lost in this tidal wave of new features is the fact that Fields is essentially being written off as the Steelers' starting QB. I get why that is, too, because Russell Wilson has superior experience, far more career success, and just needs to play at a level similar to last season. History suggests Pittsburgh will win at least nine games as long as he does that.\n\nRetired do-it-all feature back Le'Veon Bell piled on Fields' status as a second-stringer by highlighting how the young field general can't throw with anticipation even during offseason workouts.\n\nWhether the late ball arrival was part of the drill or not, Fields sure could use some practice with routes on air at getting the ball out of his hands before the receiver comes out of his break. Otherwise, he'll be relegated to special Wildcat-centric packages with occasional throws, or to return man status.\n\nToo bad Fields has never put it all together as a pocket passer. He looked way more comfortable at Ohio State in that regard, but the speed of the NFL game has him just a tick slow in terms of processing and seeing the field. Maybe this perceived slight by Madden is the last straw that drives Fields to beat out Wilson in training camp. Not holding my breath on that outcome, though.\n\nShall we not end this Madden 25 piece on a Fields-bashing downer? How about the life San Francisco 49ers tailback Christian McCaffrey is leading these days?

Kaboly broke down the \"winners\" and \"losers\" of the camp and placed Fields on the loser's side of things. He did not indicate that Fields was struggling, only that he would likely not win the starting job over Wilson, which everyone presumed would happen anyway.\n\nThis rumor began to spread, leading to Steelers general manager Omar Khan speaking on Fields' abilities and character.\n\nPat McAfee addressed the rumor on his show, stating that Kaboly \"never indicated that Fields is disinterested of being a Steeler.\" McAfee also indicated that Khan spoke to \"S/A 93.7\" The Fan about these rumors.\n\nAccording to Khan, \"Justin is exciting to have. If you would have told that we would be sitting here with Russell Wilson, Justin Fields, and Kyle Allen five months ago, I wouldn't have believed you. We really like Justin coming out of college. Obviously, he had an up-and-down situation in Chicago, but I'm excited. He's really looked awesome. He is a great individual, too. I didn't really know him personally before he got here, but what a special person he is.\"\n\nKhan laid it all out: Fields is a special person, and the team is excited to have him as a part of the Steelers organization.\n\nA couple of weeks ago when Fields himself stated that he was attempting to win the starting job. Any rumors that he's struggling and not buying into being a Steeler would suggest the complete opposite. Granted, it will be difficult for Fields to unseat the more experienced Wilson, but his drive is there.\n\nThere's no guarantee Wilson will also remain healthy through the whole season, and the Steelers are in a very advantageous position considering they now have one of the top backup quarterbacks in the entire NFL.

You don't need to be an expert at watching film to see just how pathetic this video is, and frankly, the reason why Bears GM Ryan Poles traded Justin Fields for next to nothing.\n\nEven former Steelers great Le'Veon Bell sounded off on the video:\n\nThe video shows Fields throwing a series of passes to \"RouteGod\" who is, apparently, very good at running routes. Anyway, a plethora of the throws arrive quite late to the pass-catcher, which is a huge \"no-no\" for QBs, as getting the ball to their target late usually always involves an incomplete pass or an interception.\n\nLe'Veon Bell makes note of this too, and it's easy to see why they've sounded off on it. This is just not great for Justin Fields, who was a disaster of a QB during his first three years in the NFL with the Chicago Bears. The Bears rightly traded Fields and took Caleb Williams in the 2024 NFL Draft, but many Bears fans and NFL fans were calling for the Bears to keep Fields and \"build\" around him, whatever that means.\n\nIt's not possible to build around a bad quarterback. And with Fields now with Pittsburgh, he's got a fresh start, but is already the QB2 to Russell Wilson, who signed with the team earlier this offseason. Overall, it's not a good look for Fields, and the Steelers would be in deep trouble if he had to start games at QB in 2024.\n\nYou may see Fields on the field in certain gadget plays, but I would assume that'd be about it.

On Thursday, EA Sports released a trailer for the upcoming game release, which surprisingly starts with new Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Justin Fields returning a kickoff.\n\nThough most players claim they'd do anything a coach needs them to do for the team on gameday, returning kicks is not on Fields' agenda for his first season with the Steelers. The former Bears first-rounder laughed off the idea when the chatter started about the potential for using the QB on special teams last month.\n\n\"Nah, I'm not here to do that,\" Fields told reporters at OTAs. \"It was kind of a joke, to be honest with you.\"\n\nThe \"joke\" gained its legs in early May when Steelers running back Jaylen Warren talked about a special teams meeting with Danny Smith. During the meeting, it was suggested that Fields might use his exceptional giddy-up skills to bolster the special teams unit.\n\nWhen Warren dropped the nugget on Cam Heyward's podcast, social media did its thing. Everybody started talking about the possibility of the new Steelers quarterback doing something more than throw passes considering Russell Wilson is the favorite to start at QB.\n\nFields told reporters he was in the Steelers meeting when Smith suggested he do it. He hasn't returned kicks since he was in middle school back home in Kennesaw, Georgia, but apparently, the Madden creators believe he could sill do it.\n\nLanding the cover of Madden NFL 25 is a big honor for San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, but is it also a major risk? The so-called Madden Curse has stolen the seasons of several athletes in recent years after they graced the cover of the popular EA Sports game. After news broke of his selection for this year's game, McCaffrey weighed in on the Madden Curse and how it felt to receive the call about his opportunity.\n\n\"No, yeah, no, I'm not superstitious at all about it,\" McCaffrey said on NFL Network's Insiders. \"I was so excited man. This was such an honor to be able to do this. When I got the call I was just in shock. It's something that I just never thought would happen to me.\n\n\"I never thought that someone would call and tell me I'm going to be on the cover of Madden. So, when I got the call, I wasn't thinking about any curse. I was just excited. I mean, I think that stuff is kind of a myth and whatever happens, happens. I'm excited to be on the cover.\"\n\nMcCaffrey is coming off of a 2023 season with 1,459 rushing yards (a career-high) and 14 touchdowns. As a receiver, he also hauled in 564 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. McCaffrey won the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year award for his performance and helped San Francisco advance to a Super Bowl appearance.\n\nIt's been a huge month for the 49ers star already. San Francisco rewarded McCaffrey for his standout play by extending his contract and re-setting the running back market with a new deal. He will now average $19 million per year.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL_25", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL 25"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EA_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "EA Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennesaw,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/11/15085950/justin-fields-bears-vikings-nov-15.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Who looks like the early leader?\n\nAccording to Steelers insider Mike DeFabo of The Athletic, Wilson is the clear favorite in this competition (if it even is one anymore). He explained in a recent column that Wilson is getting the \"overwhelming majority of meaningful reps\" in practice and believes that Fields might not get a real chance to distinguish himself until the preseason in August.\n\n\"Can Justin Fields make this a competition?\" DeFabo asked.\n\n\"Because right now, it's not. Wilson has taken the overwhelming majority of meaningful reps, including on the final day of minicamp, when almost every veteran took off on what felt like the last day of school. Really, it's hard to argue with this decision right now because Wilson has clearly been the better quarterback and has begun to take hold of the leadership aspects of the position.\n\n\"The major opportunity for Fields lies in preseason games. Because he's still working on processing the game more quickly and his accuracy can be spotty, the former Bears QB doesn't often shine in seven-on-seven situations. But once the pads come on and he can showcase his speed and athleticism, he's a difference-maker. Although he'll face an uphill climb to challenge Wilson for the QB1 spot on the depth chart, at least early, it's worth remembering Fields might also be auditioning for his next job in the preseason.\"\n\nWilson makes the most sense regardless of their current form. He's more polished as a passer than Fields and while his mobility might not do him any favors, his experience should make up for it.\n\nCan the Steelers be a contender in the AFC with either Wilson or Fields as their starter this season?", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tzvi_machlin@postandcourier.com", "name": "Tzvi Machlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Masters", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Masters", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/7e/17e63ead-85c0-56c3-b1b6-129280620f43/6674777c90793.image.jpg?crop=1188%2C624%2C0%2C88&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Minicamp and organized team activities have come and gone and training camp is still a few weeks away.\n\nWith nothing happening on the field, the conversations off it tend to become wilder and wilder. One of the biggest storylines after the team's minicamp was that newly acquired quarterback Justin Fields struggled. Team insider Ray Fittipaldo and Mark Kaboly shared observations and reports from team sessions that highlighted the already-known accuracy issues, and the buzz has grown like wildfire.\n\nKaboly feels the narrative around Fields is off base and his words are being taken out of context. He recently appeared on the Locked on Steelers podcast, hosted by Chris Carter, to set the record straight. The two discussed OTA's and minicamp in detail and eventually discussed the team's quarterback situation. Speaking about Fields, Kaboly clarified what he meant to convey with his minicamp reports.\n\n\"His accuracy has been inconsistent,\" he stated. \"I didn't say terrible, I said inconsistent.\"\n\nKaboly doubled down on his thoughts on Fields by discussing the inconsistencies further. He and Carter discussed the scouting report on Fields. They both agreed that Fields' deficiencies are well documented and that the Steelers knew them well before trading for him. Because of this, it wasn't a surprise to see these issues pop up during OTA's.\n\n\"There were times when he threw a rocket ball and you'd be like, 'wow, this guy's unbelievable,\" he said. \"Then a couple plays later you'd be like 'where was that intended for?'\"\n\nKaboly was most irritated by people taking his recent articles and comments as an insult towards Fields. It wasn't his intention, he tells Carter, but rather an attempt to point out his observations. Speaking to Carter, Kaboly discussed why he doesn't use terms like \"struggle\" this early in the process.\n\n\"I would never use the word struggle when it comes to OTA's and minicamp,\" he said. \"That's stuff you're just trying to learn and get some reps right there.\"\n\nDespite the need to improve, the Steelers believe in Fields long-term regardless if he starts week one of the 2024 season. He may not any games this season if Russell Wilson is healthy, but that doesn't eliminate the possibility of Fields becoming the man for Pittsburgh in 2025 and beyond. There are more details to work out, like his contract after the upcoming season, but if the team wants him around they will make it happen. In the meantime, Fields must keep improving to carve out his role with the Steelers.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mini-camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Carter_(screenwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Carter (screenwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Fields", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2933,h_1649,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_steelers/01j0tvnd07s53b51n0jn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This year, Orr had two Pittsburgh Steelers-centric predictions.\n\nOne could be categorized as bold, while the other one...well, not so much.\n\nOrr predicts that Steelers' quarterback Justin Fields will score five touchdowns in 2024 as a non-quarterback, and he also predicted that star outside linebacker T.J. Watt will win the 2024 NFL Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nWith the Fields prediction, it's quite simple where Orr is coming from. The Steelers are going to lean into the two-QB system to try and utilize Fields' skillsets in unique ways under head coach Mike Tomlin and offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, potentially leading to some success for Fields.\n\n\"The old axiom has long been that if your team claims to have two quarterbacks, it really has none. I think this year's Pittsburgh Steelers could legitimately buck that trend,\" Orr writes regarding his first prediction for the Steelers. \"I love the idea of keeping an opponent in suspense much the way the Jets tried to do with Mark Sanchez and Tim Tebow (though they failed horribly). There really and truly is a finite amount of time a team has to prepare for its opponents, and not knowing which quarterback will walk out onto the field at any given moment could be a disaster for defenses.\n\n\"We saw this when the 49ers started introducing Colin Kaepernick into their offensive scheme during the Jim Harbaugh era. All that said, I think one of the Steelers' more successful packages will be with Fields and Wilson on the field at the same time.\"\n\nThe possibility of a package featuring both Fields and Russell Wilson on the field at the same time is certainly exciting to think about, especially with Fields' rushing abilities, though it's not exactly something head coach Mike Tomlin likes to do.\n\nHe has a 1,000-yard rushing season under his belt already in the NFL and has rushed for more than 2,000 yards in the NFL as a dual-threat quarterback in just four seasons in the NFL. Though he still needs to take steps forward as a passer, there is no denying just how dynamic he is with the football in his hands as a runner.\n\nThe Steelers should try and utilize that under Smith. It can be difficult and potentially hinder an offense rotating quarterbacks, but Fields isn't the type of talent at the position that you just keep plastered to the bench. He has to be utilized in creative ways. Hopefully the Steelers do that, and if they do it properly it could lead to five touchdowns scored as a non-quarterback like Orr predicts.\n\nAs for his other Steelers' prediction, Orr sees Watt winning his second NFL Defensive Player of the Year award, one year after being robbed of his second by Cleveland's Myles Garrett.\n\nAhead of the 2024 season, it seems like there is a public push for Dallas EDGE Micah Parsons to win his first, which likely won't slow down anytime soon. But, Orr sees Watt winning the award for the second time, cementing his Hall of Fame career.\n\n\"With more stability at the quarterback position, the Steelers will be playing ahead more often than not, despite an absolutely absurd and rigorous back-end schedule that has them taking on all of their division rivals in the final weeks of the year,\" Orr writes regarding Watt. \"The AFC North remains the best division in football because of its stockpile of finalists for the award.\"\n\nThe reasoning behind why Watt will win the DPOY award is sound.\n\nWith Wilson and Fields both in the fold, providing upgrades at quarterback for the Black and Gold, and Smith providing stability and functionality as the offensive coordinator, the Steelers should be playing ahead more in games, which in turn will allow guys like Watt and Alex Highsmith to pin their ears back defensively and get after opposing quarterbacks late in games.\n\nThat could lead to some impressive sack numbers, which theoretically help Watt in his push to win the award again. But even after leading the NFL in sacks with 19.0 last season, that wasn't enough.\n\nIt's something Watt has asked for more clarity on when it comes to what voters are looking for with the award. It doesn't appear that he's received that clarity, but he's entering the 2024 season with a massive chip on his shoulder, which could lead to a monster season for the star pass rusher.\n\nRelated Items:Conor Orr, Justin Fields, Pittsburgh Steelers, Sports Illustrated, T.J.

quarterback Justin Fields training with James Everett Jr., who goes by RouteGod -- a football coach specializing in receiver performance.\n\n\"That ball gettin there lateeeeeeeee \" Bell wrote on X, attaining more than 22,000 likes. \"I know it's routes on air, but this is telling you a lot.\"\n\nIn the clips, Fields' receivers appeared to complete their routes -- including corners, curls and outs -- and then waited for several moments before the ball arrived.\n\nEverett defended the 25-year-old quarterback late Wednesday night, writing on X that the focus was for Fields to work on making multiple reads before firing to a target.\n\n\"The Balls Ain't Late \u203c\ufe0f His QB Trainer Was There And They Was Working Progressions He A Great Q And Everything Was on The Money \ud83c\udfaf,\" Everett posted.\n\nIt would appear that Bell, 32, is still keeping tabs on his former team, which traded for Fields this offseason following three topsy-turvy seasons with the Bears.\n\nThe former first-round pick accrued 2,220 rushing yards from 2021-23 but never fully developed as a passer, never eclipsing 2,600 yards or 18 passing touchdowns in a complete year.\n\nTurnovers remained an Achilles' heel for Fields, who tossed 30 interceptions and fumbled 38 times in Chicago.\n\nIn a reply to the original post, Bell added that Fields \"definitely gotta bunch of room improve .. which can also be scary with all the talent he has.\"\n\nBell starred with the Steelers from 2013-17, where he racked up 5,336 rushing yards, which ranked third among all players.\n\nThe three-time Pro Bowler infamously missed the 2018 season after not signing a second consecutive franchise tag offered by Pittsburgh, then signed a four-year, $52.5 million deal with the Jets.\n\nBell's career stalled from there, playing only 17 games in New York before effectively hanging it up in 2021.\n\nThe Michigan State alum has participated in several boxing matches but hinted at a return to football, including with Pittsburgh.\n\nLast year, Bell reflected on his exit from Pittsburgh, saying he \"probably could've really ate\" differences in guaranteed money before leaving for the Jets.\n\nFields and the current Steelers will have 34 more days to train with external coaches until players report to Latrobe, Pa., on July 24 for the beginning of training camp.\n\nPittsburgh's camp offers particular

A Hall of Famer in his own right, Drexler was indeed a great player. But everyone in the know wasn't surprised when Jordan made it emphatically clear who the better player was during the six-game series, which was ultimately won by Jordan's Bulls.\n\nWhile the Steelers' current quarterback situation isn't quite as emphatic as the fabled Jordan-Drexler debate, the narrative that Wilson is in a position battle with Justin Fields is similarly laughable. With minicamp over and training camp on the horizon, Wilson continues to be the clear-cut starter over Fields, a fact that was recently reinforced by The Athletic's Mark Kaboly.\n\nDuring the Steelers' three-day minicamp, Wilson took the majority of the first-team reps and looked the part doing so. His arm talent was reportedly one of the biggest things that stood out.\n\nFields' oft-discussed athleticism was on display during minicamp, but so too were some of the issues that plagued him during his time in Chicago. Accuracy and footwork issues were reportedly some of the biggest flaws observed from the former first-round pick.\n\nThis should all be expected. Wilson, even though his time in Denver didn't go as planned, is still a quality starting quarterback whose past includes nine Pro Bowls, two Super Bowl trips and a Super Bowl win. The Steelers brought Wilson in to be the team's starting quarterback, and that never changed, even with the addition of Fields, who is still tapping into his potential.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_deardo@cbssports.com", "name": "Bryan DeArdo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Drexler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clyde Drexler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/20/c34cd685-0ff1-415a-9890-c2118ed2ed85/thumbnail/1200x675/bc62117a218de26b873e9a55cc071416/russell-wilson.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Things tend to be read too far into, with early conclusions drawn. That's a mistake.\n\nRight now, it appears to be happening with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the quarterback situation between Russell Wilson and Justin Fields. Wilson, who was signed as a free agent, is saying and doing all the right things, while some relatively negative reports about Fields continue to come out following Organized Team Activities and minicamp.\n\nWilson remains in the pole position overall, but for ESPN's Damien Woody, a former NFL offensive lineman with the Patriots and Jets, he is waiting until the pads come on in training camp to make any type of conclusion regarding the Steelers' quarterback battle.\n\n\"Russell Wilson obviously is in the pole position, but let's not forget here: Football is played in pads, not in shorts. We get enamored with what's going on in the spring,\" Woody said of the QB situation on NFL Live Thursday, according to video the NFL on ESPN YouTube page. \"Russell Wilson's...saying all the right things and...quarterback's throwing on air. I'm waiting to see when the pads come on, when the real bullets are flying, then people will start separating themselves. It's great in the spring, but come training camp it's a different story.\n\n\"So listen. Yes, Russell Wilson, with his plethora of experience, he's probably gonna get the starting nod. But make no mistake about it, he's gonna have to continue to play at a high level to hold off Justin Fields,and what Justin Fields brings to the equation, which is that rare athletic ability at the quarterback position.\"\n\nThat's a well-thought-out, reasonable take from Woody, which is rather refreshing.\n\nAlthough it's expected that Wilson will be the starter, drawing any type of conclusion or planting your flag on either side of the discussion regarding the QB position for the Steelers based on OTAs and minicamp seems pointless. All that the quarterbacks did during OTAs and minicamp was continue to learn the playbook under offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, establish chemistry with the other pieces on the offense and try and get acclimated to a new city, new facility and a bunch of new faces.\n\nWhile the Steelers have said time and time again that Wilson is in the pole position and that Fields will compete under center at an appropriate time and place, that appropriate time is coming in training camp when the intensity is ratcheted up.\n\nThere, conclusions can be draw, stances taken and decisions made at the quarterback position for the Steelers.\n\nIt might not be a true competition just yet between Wilson and Fields, but with Fields' skillset and upside, he could force it to become a true competition under center.\n\nRelated Items:Damien Woody, ESPN, Justin Fields, NFL Live, Pittsburgh Steelers, Russell Wilson, Trending Recommended for you Steelers Happy Keeping Keeanu Benton Along Interior, Not Defensive End Cam Heyward Provides Words Of Encouragement For Kenny Pickett: 'Future Is Still Bright' Shannon Sharpe On Steelers-Ravens Rivalry: 'I Called Burress Plexi-Glass'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carney@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Josh Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Woody", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Damien Woody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA\u2013USC_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCLA\u2013USC rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Sharpe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shannon Sharpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DamienWoodyNFLLive.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668384", "eventUri": "eng-9668384", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 456620570, "relevance": 2}

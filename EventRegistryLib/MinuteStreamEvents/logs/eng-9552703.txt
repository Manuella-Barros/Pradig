There's also a nod for the more experienced Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka, both of whom are still within the age threshold for the award.\n\nPalmer and Foden are also nominated for the Player of the Season award, as are fellow young player nominees Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland. The list for Young Player of the Year is rounded out by Arsenal defender William Saliba and Tottenham new boy Destiny Udogie.\n\nWhat have the eight nominees done to warrant their inclusion, though? Here, Mirror Football takes a closer look at their respective seasons.\n\nPhil Foden\n\nManchester City star Foden has really stepped up this season in the absence of some more illustrious team-mates. He has already won the FWA player of the year award, and few would begrudge him doubling up when it comes to the Premier League award..\n\nAfter backing himself to thrive in a central role, the England international has done just that. A 16-goal league haul is already his best ever in a single season, with three games remaining to add to the tally, while he has 24 in all competitions.\n\nWho should win the Young Player of the Year award? Have your say in the comments section\n\nPhil Foden is having his best ever season in front of goal\n\nThere's a discussion to be had when it comes to how England manager Gareth Southgate sees best to use the 23-year-old in the summer's European Championships. The high points this season can't be knocked, though, with match-winning hat-tricks against Brentford and Aston Villa either side of a double which helped Pep Guardiola's side see off neighbours Manchester United in March.\n\nErling Haaland\n\nThere isn't much we can say about Erling Haaland that hasn't already been said. However, the ability to hit 25 league goals in an injury-interrupted season puts last year's achievements into perspective while also demonstrating an off-season for the Norwegian is still better than most players' best.\n\nThe former Dortmund star has 'only' scored two league hat-tricks this term, in 5-1 victories over Fulham and Wolves, but there have been plenty of braces. And there have been plenty of occasions where his impact has made City's progress worryingly simple.\n\nErling Haaland has reached 25 league goals with time to spare\n\n\"I don't really care that much about that man, so that's all right,\" Haaland said after responding to Roy Keane criticism with four of his team's five against Wolves. \"I don't care, we just have to win our games and now, relax tonight and focus on Fulham.\"\n\nWith three games to go, he can add to his goal tally and lead City to what would be a fourth straight title. He's already scored more than anyone managed in any of the four seasons before his arrival in England, and from just 29 appearances.\n\nAlexander Isak\n\nIsak is another who has impressed despite injury woes, after last season gave a hint to his capabilities. After scoring 10 league goals in 22 outings last season, he has doubled that tally in just five extra games this term.\n\nAlexander Isak has thrived in a challenging season for Newcastle\n\nThe Sweden international is the oldest player on the shortlist at 24, right on the upper limit for the award. He also arrived at significant cost to Newcastle, but neither of these things are against the rules.\n\nIsak started the season how he meant to go on, bagging two goals in an opening weekend demolition of Aston Villa. Further braces have followed, including a notable double in the 4-0 victory over Tottenham, while he scored twice from the spot in the dramatic 4-3 comeback win against West Ham.\n\nNewcastle still have work to do to qualify for Europe, and won't be able to secure a second straight season of Champions League football. Without their leading man, though, things could be far worse.\n\nKobbie Mainoo\n\nWhen Erik ten Hag lamented the absence of Kobbie Mainoo for the first half of the season, some felt he was overstating the potential impact of a talented but inexperienced player. Since the turn of the year, though, his value to the team has been clear.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has been a bright spark for Manchester United\n\nMainoo made his senior debut in January 2023, but had only played once in the Premier League before this season. He has done enough this term to earn a first England cap, though, while holding down a starting spot at club level.\n\nA pair of stunning league goals have caught the eye, with the teenager following a last-gasp winner at Wolves with a curler in the draw at home to Liverpool. The latter drew comparisons with another famous United goal by another teenager - Federico Macheda's crucial effort in the 2008-09 run-in.\n\nUnited, as a whole, have been a mess on a number of occasions this term. The form of Mainoo has been one of the factors to give fans hope for the future, though, and many are excited to see what he can do in a more coherent team.\n\nCole Palmer Cole Palmer has excelled since joining Chelsea\n\nWhen Manchester City recouped \u00a342.5m for Cole Palmer at the end of the summer transfer window, it felt like a decent deal for everyone. City had a decent fee for a player with limited first-team experience, while Chelsea added a homegrown star to their ranks.\n\nWhile the form of Phil Foden suggests the 22-year-old might still have struggled for regular minutes at his former club, the move south couldn't have gone better. Only Haaland has more Premier League goals than Palmer's 21, and you have to go all the way back to Didier Drogba in 2009-10 for the last time a Chelsea player scored more in the league.\n\nYes, penalties have boosted the tally (as with others on this list) but that's not all he's capable of. His performance of the season came in April against Everton, when he scored a perfect hat-trick inside the opening half-hour before adding his fourth of the game from the spot.\n\nBukayo Saka Bukayo Saka has played a big part in Arsenal's title push\n\nGiven how much Bukayo Saka has achieved in his career, it's easy to forget he's still just 22. It's also easy to forget he has 16 league goals - two more than last season with a couple of games remaining.\n\nWhile team-mate Gabriel Martinelli has gone off the boil at times this season, Saka's ability to step up has been crucial to the Gunners. Eight of his 16 goals have either put Arsenal in front or drew them level, with Mikel Arteta's team losing just once when their number seven has found the net.\n\nIt's been a collective effort for Arsenal to remain in the hunt for top spot. They have the best attack and stingiest defence in the league, and a first title in 20 years would be tough to argue with if they get over the line.\n\nWithin the collective, though, there have been individuals who have stepped up. Saka's seven goals in six games helped Arsenal start 2024 like a train, giving them the platform on which to build in the latter stages of the season.\n\nWilliam Saliba William Saliba has been a key part of Arsenal's fearsome defence\n\nLike his team-mate Saka, Saliba is a player who can often feel older than his years. Not only is the centre-back just 23, but he's only in his second season as a Premier League starter.\n\nIn the last season before Saliba returned from loan, Arsenal conceded 48 goals. That dropped to 43 in his first season at the club, including 18 in 11 after injury ended his season early, while the tally this season is just 28 in 36 games.\n\nThe former Saint-Etienne star has been fantastic alongside Gabriel at the back. It's not just that opponents haven't scored many against Arsenal - it's rare to even see them get that many clear-cut chances.\n\nWith Manchester City so dominant over recent years, Arsenal have needed to be at their very best to even stand a chance. Saliba has made everyone else's job that bit easier with his calming presence as part of a terrifying defensive unit.\n\nDestiny Udogie Destiny Udogie has played a big part for a new-look Spurs\n\nTottenham's season might have petered out in the spring, but we shouldn't forget how impressive Ange Postecoglou's side looked for chunks of the campaign. Their full-backs have proved important to how the team operates under the Australian, with Udogie one of two gifts left for the boss by predecessor Antonio Conte.\n\nAfter spending last season on loan at former club Udinese, the Italian has looked perfect in Spurs' setup. His pace and attacking threat has suited a system where deep defending might as well be banned and defenders are required to have the engine to contribute at both ends.\n\nStill just 21, Udogie earned his first senior Italy cap in the autumn and helped the Azzurri get over the line and secure Euro 2024 qualification. A hamstring injury has put his involvement at the Euros in doubt, but plenty will be excited to see what he can offer his club next season as part of what they'll hope to be an even more joined-up approach in Postegoglou's second season at the helm.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

There are a couple of surprising omissions from the shortlist, including Manchester City midfielder Rodri. Newcastle forward Alexander Isak, Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk are also in contention. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe nominees are in for the Premier League's Player of the Season award and, while there are a couple of surprising omissions from the shortlist, there are plenty of familiar faces among the eight players named that might fancy their chances of taking home the gong.\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri is the most glaring absentee, while Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka might also feel hard done by not to be included, but there are representatives from both of their clubs, with City attackers Phil Foden and Erling Haaland in the mix as well as Arsenal duo Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice.\n\nGIVEMESPORT's Premier League Player of the Season rankings\n\nRanking\n\nPlayer\n\n8\n\nVirgil van Dijk\n\n7\n\nAlexander Isak\n\n6\n\nErling Haaland\n\n5\n\nMartin Odegaard\n\n4\n\nOllie Watkins\n\n3\n\nCole Palmer\n\n2\n\nDeclan Rice\n\n1\n\nPhil Foden\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Four players have won the Premier League's Player of the Season award twice - Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo, Nemanja Vidic and Kevin De Bruyne.\n\n8 Virgil van Dijk Liverpool\n\nIt took Virgil van Dijk a while to fully recover from the serious knee injury he suffered in 2020 but the Liverpool defender returned to something close to his best this season, playing a key role in dragging the Reds back up the table after a disappointing 2022-23 season in which they missed out on Champions League qualification.\n\nVan Dijk won his first trophy since becoming club captain earlier this year, scoring the winning goal deep into injury time in the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. Van Dijk's Liverpool contract is due to expire in 2025 but he has no intention of leaving Anfield any time soon, stating his desire to help the club in the post-Jurgen Klopp era. \"There will be a big transition and I am part of that,\" Van Dijk said.\n\n7 Alexander Isak Newcastle United\n\nAlexander Isak joined Newcastle in 2022 but his first season with the St James' Park club was impacted by a thigh injury that kept him out of action for three months. The Swede still scored at an impressive rate, with 10 goals in 22 Premier League appearances, but he has found another level this season.\n\nIsak has netted 20 goals in 27 league games this time around, including 10 in his last nine appearances to climb up the top scorer standings and fire the Magpies up the table. He is currently third in the Golden Boot race, one goal behind Cole Palmer and five off Erling Haaland. Arsenal have been linked with a move for Isak this summer but Toon fans will be desperate to keep hold of their star striker.\n\n6 Erling Haaland Manchester City\n\nErling Haaland will likely end the season as the Premier League's top scorer for a second successive campaign but he has not been able to replicate the form he showed during his maiden season in England. Haaland set such high standards as City won the Treble that it was always unlikely that he would be able to reach those levels again the following year.\n\nHowever, he still has 36 goals in all competitions including 25 in the top flight and in his last appearance he scored four times against Wolves. Haaland has faced criticism this season, most notably from Roy Keane, who said the level of his all-round game was like that of a League Two player, but City fans won't care as long as he keeps scoring goals at such an alarming rate.\n\n5 Martin Odegaard Arsenal\n\nIt is rare that a wonderkid goes on to realise their potential but Martin Odegaard is a perfect example of that happening. It's been almost a decade since Real Madrid agreed a deal to sign the youngster after he had just turned 16 and, while it didn't quite work out for him in Spain, there is no doubt that he is proving himself as one of the best players in the Premier League with Arsenal.\n\nMikel Arteta made Odegaard club captain in 2022 and he is a clear leader in the team, His contribution in matches is also not in question, with the Norwegian registering eight goals and eight assists in the league.\n\n4 Ollie Watkins Aston Villa\n\nAston Villa are enjoying a remarkable season and Ollie Watkins' brilliance is a huge reason behind that. The striker has scored 27 goals in all appearances, including 19 in the league, and his excellent form is expected to see him travel to the European Championship with England as Harry Kane's back-up.\n\nWere Villa not on the brink of qualifying for the Champions League, Watkins would be hot property this summer given the amount of top clubs lacking a great goalscorer, but one suspects he will be keen to stick around to sample the biggest European nights under the lights at Villa Park next term.\n\n3 Cole Palmer Chelsea\n\nCole Palmer has been simply excellent since swapping Manchester City for Chelsea last summer. Despite Pep Guardiola's reluctance to sell Palmer in the wake of Riyad Mahrez's move to Saudi Arabia, the youngster was intent on leaving the Etihad over a lack of game time.\n\nEyebrows were raised when Chelsea agreed to pay \u00a342.5million for him considering his lack of senior experience, but Palmer quickly silenced any doubters and has clearly been Chelsea's best player during a difficult season for Mauricio Pochettino's young side. With 21 Premier League goals, he is second only to former teammate Haaland in the Golden Boot standings.\n\n2 Declan Rice Arsenal\n\nIt was clear that West Ham had a generational talent in Declan Rice and it was always a case of 'when' rather than 'if' they would end up selling him to a club that was more likely to be challenging for major honours.\n\nChampions City registered their interest last summer but it was Arsenal who got a deal over the line, signing the midfielder for a mammoth \u00a3105million - a record fee for an English player. Rice has improved the Gunners' midfield significantly and has popped up with significant attacking contributions too, with seven league goals and nine league assists.\n\n1 Phil Foden Manchester City\n\nSome football fans questioned whether it was the right thing for Phil Foden to stay at City during the early stages of his senior career, with many suggesting he would be better served by leaving his boyhood club on loan to gain first-team exposure.\n\nThat was never in Pep Guardiola's plan for Foden, though, and his careful nurturing of one the greatest talents ever to emerge from City's academy was more useful for the player's development than any loan move could have been. Foden has established himself as one of the most important players in one of the best teams in the world and not many people would argue against him being the best player in the Premier League this season.\n\nRelated 10 Favourites for 2023/24 PFA Player of the Year Award Ranked The race for the PFA's prestigious Premier League award is hotting up.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com",

He has scored 16 league goals and provided eight assists this season.\n\nA City player has won the award in each of the past four seasons, with Haaland's success coming after Kevin de Bruyne in 2019-20 and 2021-22 and Ruben Dias in 2020-21.\n\nOdegaard and Rice have played pivotal roles in Arsenal's pursuit of a first title in 20 years.\n\nNorway international Odegaard has eight goals and eight assists, while England's Rice has nine goals and seven assists in his first season since joining from West Ham.\n\nPalmer, who joined Chelsea from City in September, has scored 21 goals and provided nine assists, while Sweden international Isak has 20 goals and one assist.\n\nEngland's Watkins has enjoyed a prolific season with 19 goals and 12 assists, while Netherlands international Van Dijk, who won the award in 2018-19, led Liverpool to the Carabao Cup this season.\n\nHaaland, Foden, Palmer and Isak have also been named on the Premier League young player of the season shortlist alongside Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka and defender William Saliba, Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie.\n\nWho has missed out?\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri did not make the Premier League player of the season shortlist, despite being integral to his team's success.\n\nCity have not been beaten in the league when the Spain international has played for them since a defeat at Tottenham in February 2023 - a run of 47 games.\n\nNewcastle winger Anthony Gordon also misses out, despite 10 goals and 10 assists in 33 top-flight appearances in a season in which his impressive performances have earned him an England call-up.\n\nEngland striker Dominic Solanke has 18 goals and three assists for Bournemouth, while Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has 18 goals and 10 assists in the 2023-24 campaign - both also failed to make the shortlist.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors":

He has been a key fixture within manager Erik ten Hag's plans, cementing his place in United's midfield since missing the start of the season though injury.\n\nIn total, the England international has made 21 Premier League appearances this season, scoring two goals. His maiden league goal secured a dramatic 4-3 triumph over Wolves at Molineux in February.\n\nREAD MORE: United interested in Brazilian lynchpin in bid to solve defensive crisis\n\nREAD MORE: United have six sales up their sleeve to address FFP transfer problem\n\nHe also netted against Liverpool at Old Trafford last month, bending home a brilliant second goal in a 2-2 draw. He also registered an assist in the 4-2 win over Sheffield United just over a fortnight ago.\n\nFoden, meanwhile, has enjoyed the best season of his career thus far, playing a starring role in City's quest for a fourth successive Premier League crown. He has scored 16 goals and registered eight assists in 32 appearances, including two hat-tricks.\n\nOverall, the Stockport-born attacker has scored 24 goals and reached double figures for assists across all competitions. It is his highest goal tally in a single season in his career thus far.\n\nElsewhere, Haaland, who won both the Premier League Player of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards last season, has scored 25 goals and registered five assists in just 28 league appearances this term. He scored four times in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Wolves to establish himself as the firm favourite for a second consecutive Golden Boot.\n\nMainoo, Foden and Haaland have been joined on the list of nominees by Arsenal duo William Saliba and Bukayo Saka, Chelsea ace Cole Palmer, Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak and Tottenham Hotspur defender Destiny Udogie.\n\nThe winner of the award will be decided by supporters, with voting now open to crown the winner.

Palmer won Chelsea's two Player of Year Awards, voted for by team-mates and fans, at a ceremony at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night.\n\nFoden has also been strongly tipped to win the main player of the year award after a remarkable season which looks likely to finish with City's fourth consecutive Premier League trophy.\n\nSaka and Saliba have been key to another title challenge from Arsenal, while Mainoo has enjoyed a remarkable rise to prominence in an otherwise turgid season at United. Isak's form for Newcastle has kept them in the race for European football amid a spate of injuries to the squad.\n\nThe eight nominees all qualify as they were 23 or younger at the start of the season.

The Norwegian has scored two hat-tricks, including his four-goal haul against Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend and has also chipped in with five assists, making him one of only three players to reach 30 goal involvements this term.\n\nBoth Foden and Haaland are joined on the eight-man shortlist by Arsenal pair Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice, the latter has made an impressive start to life at the Emirates Stadium following his big-money move from West Ham United last summer.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nRice, Odegaard in the mix for PL award\n\nRice has quickly established himself as a key cog in Mikel Arteta's machine, transforming from a defensive midfielder into a box-to-box powerhouse who has contributed to 15 goals (seven goals, eight assists) this season, as well as making 79 tackles and 43 interceptions.\n\nAs for Arsenal captain Odegaard, he has once again led by example this term as the Gunners endeavour to win their first league title since 2003-04. The 25-year-old has been ever-present in Arteta's side and has recorded eight goals and eight assists in 33 league appearances, as well as created 94 chances - the second-most in the division.\n\nThe only defender nominated for POTS is Liverpool's colossal captain Virgil van Dijk, who has been back to his best this season following a challenging spell in the previous campaign. The Dutchman, widely regarded as one of the best centre-backs in the Premier League, has made the third-most passes (2,721) and has won the second-most duels (186) in the division, while he has been dribbled past only twice all season.\n\nFoden and Rice are among four English players nominated for the top individual Premier League prize along with Aston Villa talisman Ollie Watkins and Chelsea talent Cole Palmer.\n\nWatkins has elevated his game to new heights this term under the tutelage of Villa manager Unai Emery and boasts the most goal involvements (31) of any player in the division. His 19 goals in 35 outings have pushed him into contention for the Golden Boot, while he currently leads the way for assists with 12 and is on course to claim the Playmaker award.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nPalmer one of four players up for two PL awards\n\nPalmer, meanwhile, is also in the Golden Boot race and has quickly established himself as Chelsea's standout performer following his transfer from Man City last summer. The versatile attacker has scored 21 goals and registered nine assists in 31 Premier League games, and he is only the third player in the division's history to reach 30+ goal involvements in a single season while aged 21 or younger, after Robbie Fowler and Chris Sutton.\n\nLast must certainly not least, Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is another name in contention for POTS following another superb campaign in front of goal. The Swede is the first Magpies player since club legend Alan Shearer in 2002-03 to reach the 20-goal mark in a Premier League season, while his minutes-per-goal ratio of 101.3 is only second to Haaland's 91.8 among players who have scored at least twice.\n\nIsak, 24, and Palmer have also been nominated for the Premier League's Young Player of the Season award along with Foden and Haaland, as well as Arsenal's Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo and Tottenham Hotspur's Destiny Udogie.\n\nAll public votes can be made on the Premier League's official website and they will be combined with those of a panel of football experts to decide a winner for each award. The results will be revealed on May 18.\n\nID:543208:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect8215:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"},

All football fans can nominate their favourite players who they might believe are worthy of the prestigious award through the official site or app of the Premier League.\n\nErling Haaland and Phil Foden are the two nominees from the defending champions Manchester City. The midfield duo of Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice will be representing the current league leaders Arsenal, Alexander Isak (Newcastle United), Virgil Van Dijk (Liverpool), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa) and Cole Palmer (Chelsea) are the other nominees as per the announcement.\n\nThe Player of the Season has been won by a Manchester City player for four seasons in a row with Erling Haaland having been the latest recipient of the award in the 2022/23 season.\n\nPhil Foden may be the frontrunner this season having performed consistently compared to Haaland who has been struggling on and off with injuries although it is still the Norwegian striker who leads the race for the Golden Boot with 25 goals to his name.\n\nMartin Odegaard has been Arsenal's most competitive and consistent player this season with many impeccable performances. The Gunners' captain has bashed in eight goals in the league whilst also providing eight assists. Declan Rice's transition from being a No.6 to No.8 has been phenomenal under Mikel Arteta. The Englishman has lived up to his hefty price together and become Arsenal's set piece taker.\n\nManchester City might live to regret letting Cole Palmer go. The young Englishman has been a bright spot in what has been a very dull Premier League campaign for Chelsea. He has 21 goals to his name, second behind only Erling Haaland.

The 18-year-old's performances in midfield earned him a first England call-up in March, which was quite the achievement given he missed most of the first three months of 2023/24 due to injury.\n\nPalmer, signed for \u00a340 million ($52.4m) last summer from Manchester City, has been sensational in what is still a flawed Chelsea team.

claimed: 'i'm seeing more outrage over an actual youngster being a NOMINEE than the facts there's seasoned pros and 24 year olds in this award.'\n\n'They have to change how this award works', one fan wrote, adding: 'It's got to be about players who clocked their first ever 20+ game season in the PL or something.'\n\nOthers have suggested it could be changed to a 'rookie' season award, to honour those who have made the most impact in their first campaign, or to suggest that previous young winners should be barred from future nomination.\n\nThe Premier League's version of the award was introduced in 2019-20, and the inaugural winner was Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nFoden achieved his double success in the years that followed, before Haaland lifted the Young Player award

The Manchester City star has 25 goals in 28 games at the time of the shortlist's revelation, leading the Golden Boot charge once again.\n\nCity have won this award three times in a row, with Haaland ending the two-year reign of Phil Foden. The 23-year-old is back in the running this year after a sensational campaign which saw him recently named the FWA Footballer of the Year as well.\n\nNewcastle United striker Alexander Isak is hoping to pick up the award after an incredible individual season. Rumours of \u00a3100m moves to Europe's elite are no coincidence after the Swede's haul of 20 goals in 27 games.\n\nKobbie Mainoo of Manchester United makes his first shortlist and, at only 19, could be a regular feature for years to come. The midfielder has firmly established himself as an integral part of the Red Devils' midfield, with a maiden England call-up during the last international break a fair reward for his performances.\n\n2023/24 has been a mixed season for Chelsea fans but the form of Cole Palmer has been an undisputed highlight. In his first year at Stamford Bridge, the former Man City youngster has put the team on his back at times and launched a surprise Golden Boot charge with 21 goals and nine assists.\n\nOver at Arsenal, Bukayo Saka is vying to get his hands on the prize for the first time. Saka leads the Gunners for both goals and assists this year and will hope to wrestle the crown away from his Man City rivals.\n\nWilliam Saliba joins Saka on the shortlist after another dazzling campaign at the heart of the Premier League's meanest defence. Mikel Arteta's side have allowed just 28 goals so far, with Saliba playing a huge role in that success.\n\nRounding things off is Tottenham Hotspur left-back Destiny Udogie. While his season may have been ended by injury, his time on the pitch was truly sublime.

So just how young is young when it comes to the Premier League Young Player of the Season award?\n\nThe Premier League's Young Player of the Season award is open to players who were aged 23 or under at the start of the 2023/24 season.\n\nThat means this will be the last year of eligibility for Isak, Haaland and Foden and Saliba, but the other shortlisted players - Mainoo, Saliba, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Destiny Udogie - could again be up for the award in 12 months time.\n\nWhile the Premier League Young Player of the Season defines 'young' as 23 and under, the more established PFA Young Player of the Year responded to criticism that the 23 cutoff was too old by reducing the age of eligibility in 2021.\n\nPlayers must now have been aged 21 or under as of July 1 immediately preceding the start of the season in order to be running for this award, which has been dished out since the 1973/74 season and has a roll call of winners that contains some of the best players of the past 50 years.\n\nThat means we can expect a much more youthful shortlist when that is announced, with two-time winner Foden too old to be considered.\n\nManchester United: Relegation-threatened manager sensationally tipped to replace Erik ten Hag\n\nTottenham preparing for summer exodus with key first-team duo among seven potential exits: report", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_mewis@fourfourtwo.com", "name": "Joe Mewis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Young_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Young Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TGpdMqGppq7Bv8PGNbm8VA-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1946, "textEnd": 1952}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

All football fans can nominate their favourite players who they might believe are worthy of the prestigious award through the official site or app of the Premier League.\n\nErling Haaland and Phil Foden are the two nominees from the defending champions Manchester City. The midfield duo of Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice will be representing the current league leaders Arsenal, Alexander Isak (Newcastle United), Virgil Van Dijk (Liverpool), Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa) and Cole Palmer (Chelsea) are the other nominees as per the announcement.\n\nThe Player of the Season has been won by a Manchester City player for four seasons in a row with Erling Haaland having been the latest recipient of the award in the 2022/23 season. Phil Foden may be the frontrunner this season having performed consistently compared to Haaland who has been struggling on and off with injuries although it is still the Norwegian striker who leads the race for the Golden Boot with 25 goals to his name.\n\nMartin Odegaard has been Arsenal's most competitive and consistent player this season with many impeccable performances. The Gunners' captain has bashed in eight goals in the league whilst also providing eight assists. Declan Rice's transition from being a No.6 to No.8 has been phenomenal under Mikel Arteta. The Englishman has lived up to his hefty price together and become Arsenal's set piece taker.\n\nManchester City might live to regret letting Cole Palmer go. The young Englishman has been a bright spot in what has been a very dull Premier League campaign for Chelsea. He has 21 goals to his name, second behind only Erling Haaland.

Fans have until 12:00 BST on Monday, May 13, to vote for their favorite candidates via the EA SPORTS website.\n\nAs reported earlier by the News Chronicle, the public votes will be combined with those of a panel of football experts to decide the winner, who will be announced on Saturday, May 18.\n\nPhil Foden (Man City)\n\nThe 23-year-old Manchester City Academy graduate has been one of the standout players this season. The English midfielder has netted 16 Premier League goals plus 8 assists this season for the Cityzens, who push for their fourth title in a row. Foden has been involved in 32 games for City; they have won 22, lost 3, and drew 3 in all the league games he has featured in this season.\n\nErling Haaland (Man City)\n\nNorwegian striker Erling Haaland, who broke the Premier League record for the most goals and claimed the golden boot last season with 36 goals, is on another mission to defend his award after netting 25 times in just 28 league appearances this season. Haaland scored four goals in his last league game, expanding the difference against his closest rival by four goals.\n\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle)\n\nThe Swedish striker is the first Newcastle player to reach the 20-goal mark for the Magpies since Alan Shearer in 2002/03. Isak has 20 league goals to his name in his debut season, while his minutes-per-goal rate of 101.3 is second only to Haaland's 91.8 among players with more than two goals.\n\nMartin Odegaard (Arsenal)\n\nArsenal's captain, Martin Odegaard, has guided his side to a positive dream of lifting the title having lost it to City last season. The 25-year-old has scored eight goals, assisted eight goals, and created 94 chances, the second most in the league, while also being a key part of their pressing game.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea)\n\nChelsea Men's Players' Player of the Year and Men's Player of the Year, Cole Palmer, has been nominated for the Premier League's best player award. Since making his switch to Chelsea from Manchester City, Palmer has single-handedly driven the Chelsea team off ignominy with his goalscoring prowess. Remarkably, he has tied Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard's Chelsea record of 16 home Premier League goals in a season while also becoming only the third player in history to reach 30+ goal involvements in a PL season while aged 21 or younger, after Robbie Fowler and Chris Sutton.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal)\n\nIn his inaugural season, Declan Rice has been pivotal for the Gunners, playing all their 36 league games since his mega-switch from West Ham. West Ham Coach David Moyes could not help asserting that their difficulties began since Rice left the club. Mikel Arteta has transformed him from a holding midfielder into a superb box-to-box player, as shown by Rice directly contributing to 15 goals while also making 79 tackles and 43 interceptions.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n\nLiverpool's and Dutch Captain, Virgil Van Dijk, has been one of the most consistent center-backs this season. Regardless of Liverpool's passing the baton to Arsenal and Manchester City after their inconsistency, Virgil Van Dijk has guided the team to 21 wins in all 34 league games he has played. The 32-year-old has made the third-most passes in the league and been dribbled past only twice all season, while his 186 duels won are the second most of any center-back.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa)\n\nOne of the breaking-in surprises of the season is Villa's forward, Ollie Watkins.

He is trying to be part of the first team to win four straight Premier League titles and previously won this award in 2021 and 2022.\n\nErling Haaland - Man City\n\nLast year's winner has scored 25 goals and assisted five more in only 28 Premier League appearances in a stop-start campaign for the Norwegian. He is leading the race for the Golden Boot and is one of only three players with 30 goal involvements this season.\n\nAlexander Isak - Newcastle\n\nThe 24-year-old Swede is nominated for a second straight season after scoring 20 goals in just 27 league appearances for Newcastle - the first Magpies player since Alan Shearer in 2002-03 to reach that milestone.\n\nKobbie Mainoo - Man United\n\nThe 19-year-old has enjoyed a breakout campaign for Man United and has established himself as a key figure in Erik ten Haag's midfield. He has only scored twice in 21 appearances but one was a late winner against Wolves and the other a stunner in the draw against Liverpool.\n\nCole Palmer - Chelsea\n\nThe 22-year-old has enjoyed an incredible debut season after his arrival from Man City. He has scored 21 goals - 16 of them at Stamford Bridge - and has nine assists to become only the third player to reach 30 goal involvements aged 21 or younger.\n\nBukayo Saka - Arsenal\n\nWith 16 goals and nine assists, 22-year-old Saka leads both categories for title-chasing Arsenal this season, despite playing out wide.\n\nWilliam Saliba - Arsenal\n\nThe 23-year-old Frenchman has been a key feature of the Premier League's tightest defence, helping Mikel Arteta's side keep 17 clean sheets, conceding only 28 goals in 36 games so far. He is one of only two outfield players to have played every minute of the Premier League season.\n\nDestiny Udogie - Tottenham\n\nThe 21-year-old Italy international made a big impression on his debut season in English football. He has scored twice and assisted three goals while creating 24 chances. Though his season was cut short by injury, Tottenham have only lost six times in games he has played, only once more than Saliba's record at Arsenal.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Young_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Young Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobbie_Mainoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobbie Mainoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_Udogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Destiny Udogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/shutterstock_1361406977.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 400, "textEnd": 406}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 519, "textEnd": 525}], "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Manchester City and Arsenal had two players nominated each, while there were also candidates from Liverpool, Chelsea, Newcastle United, and Aston Villa.\n\nThe nominees are detailed below, along with a short description of why they are up for the award, the winner of which will not be officially announced until the 2023/24 Premier League season has concluded.\n\nThe Sporting News has also looked back at the past winners of the prize, stretching back to the mid-1990s, when the Premier League was still in its infancy.\n\nMORE: Erling Haaland on course to win second consecutive Premier League Golden Boot\n\nEight players were named on the shortlist for the Player of the Season award for 2023/24.\n\nThe FWA Footballer of the Year, Foden has enjoyed arguably his best season for Man City in their bid to win a record fourth consecutive Premier League title.\n\nAlthough not quite at the levels of last season, when he smashed the record for goals in a single Premier League season , Haaland still leads the Golden Boot standings and sets the standard for strikers in Europe.\n\nNewcastle have been far less consistent than they were in 2022/23, but Isak has been outstanding. He became the first Magpies player in 21 years to score 20 goals in a single Premier League season.\n\nArsenal's captain has been key to their sustained title challenge this season. Odegaard may have recorded fewer goals and assists than last season (when he had 22 combined), but his all-round play has helped the Gunners keep up their impressive form.\n\nEyebrows were raised when Chelsea signed Palmer from Man City for an initial \u00a340 million ($52.4m) last summer, but the England star looks like being the best bit of business of the past year. He's just the third player aged 21 or younger to record 30+ goal involvements in a single Premier League season, after Robbie Fowler and Chris Sutton.\n\nMORE: Will Cole Palmer make the England squad for Euro 2024?\n\nArsenal paid an astonishing \u00a3105 million ($138m) to sign Rice from West Ham, but his imperious performances in midfield have made a real difference to the Gunners' title hopes.\n\nLiverpool's title hopes may have faded , but Van Dijk has had something of a renaissance this season, looking at least somewhat close to his indomitable best in Jurgen Klopp's final season in charge.\n\nThe spearhead of Aston Villa's amazing challenge for a UEFA Champions League spot, Watkins is still in the running to finish the season as the top goalscorer and assist-provider in the league.\n\nThe winner of the prize will be announced on Tuesday, May 21, two days after the final matchday of the Premier League season.\n\nFans can vote for their preferred winner of the award via the Premier League website.\n\nThe award has run since the 1994/95 season and has seen 25 different winners in that time.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting

key players have stood out among their peers.\n\nMikel Arteta's side have been fighting Pep Guardiola's Manchester City side for the title, but unless the Champions now drop points, Arsenal are likely to fall just short.\n\nNevertheless, Arsenal have the best attacking and defensive records in the league, and a run of outstanding form with just one defeat in 16 games in 2024 has shown that they are capable of competing at the top end of the table.\n\nArsenal have also made themselves competitive with one of the youngest squads in the league, and this has been reflected in the Premier League Young Player Of The Year nominations.\n\nBukayo Saka and William Saliba nominated for Premier League Young Player Of The Year awards\n\nThe six nominees for the Premier League Young Player Of The Year award have now been announced, and two Arsenal players feature.\n\nPlayers who are 23 or younger at the start of the season are eligible for the award, meaning that the shortlist contains established superstars as well as young talents.\n\nArsenal winger Bukayo Saka, and centre-back William Saliba are among the six nominees, for which the winner will be announced on 18th May.\n\nThe other nominees are Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo, Chelsea's Cole Palmer, Manchester City pair Erling Haaland and Phil Foden, Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie and Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.\n\nArsenal target Alexander Isak joins Saka and Saliba in PL YPOTY nominees\n\nArsenal have been linked with a move for Isak, as Arteta is seemingly keen on adding a proven goalscorer to his squad.\n\nIsak has been outstanding this season, with 20 goals in 27 league games, and he could be the perfect fit as a centre-forward or as a winger to add much-needed speed to the squad.\n\nHe will not come cheaply, as it has been reported that he would likely cost a minimum of \u00a3100m, if Newcastle are willing to let him leave.\n\nREAD MORE: All Mikel Arteta signings at Arsenal ranked from worst to

games.\n\nHis former team-mate and current Chelsea star Cole Palmer, is second in the player of the season running and third for the young player award, with an average rating of 7.71.\n\nDespite not being included in the shortlist for player of the season, Arsenal star Bukayo Saka does get the nod for second place in the young player gong with a rating of 7.73.\n\nHowever, his Arsenal team-mates Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice are ranked third and fourth in the list for the main prize.\n\nDefending player of the year winner Erling Haaland is only fifth in the rankings to retain his award, while he's also fourth to win in the young player category.\n\nLiverpool star Virgil van Dijk was the only defender to be included in the player of the season shortlist, and he is sixth in Sofascore's ratings, ahead of Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins and Newcastle forward Alexander Isak.\n\nIsak is fifth in the ranking for the young player award, ahead of Arsenal's William Saliba, Manchester United rookie Kobbie Mainoo and Tottenham's Destiny Udogie.\n\nIt's perhaps no surprise that Manchester City and Arsenal have dominated the shortlist for the two prizes as they battle it out to win the Premier League title.\n\nMartin Odegaard is statistically the third best option for the main prize, with Saka second in the running to retain his young player of the season award\n\nVirgil van

given that they have a game in hand.\n\nLiverpool are five points off the top but it's likely that mathematically their chances will be over this weekend.\n\nManchester City have dominated the Premier League player of the season award over the past four years, with Kevin De Bruyne winning twice, Ruben Dias taking the prize in 2021 and Haaland last year.\n\nShould Foden be crowned the young player

But with the pressure on Declan Rice after his $125 million transfer to Arsenal last summer, the way he has settled in and taken his game to a new level, gives him this award. To be fully transparent, I voted for Rice as my men's player of the year in The Football Writers' Association player of the season vote. He has given Arsenal the solidity they needed defensively and is the perfect player to dovetail with Martin Odegaard in midfield, while Rice has also added more goals and assist to his game this season. He has become the complete midfield player in a Roy Keane or Patrick Vieira way and Rice makes every player around him better.\n\nErling Haaland (Man City)\n\nPhil Foden (Man City)\n\nBukayo Saka (Arsenal)\n\nWilliam Saliba (Arsenal)\n\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle)\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea)\n\nKobbie Mainoo (Man United)\n\nDestiny Udogie (Tottenham)\n\nThe criteria for this award (aged 23 or younger at the start of the season) probably needs to change because there are some huge names on this list. As goos as Saka, Haaland, Foden, Saliba and Isak have been, the correct answer is: Cole Palmer. Scoring 20+ goals in your first season as a starter, at a brand new club, with huge problems at that club due to injuries and Mauricio Pochettino trying to usher in his philosophy in his first season in charge, is mind-blowing. Palmer, who just turned 22, took the brave decision to leave City for more minutes and it has worked out brilliantly. The confidence he has is infectious. I actually selected him to be my young player of the season at the start of the campaign after watching him rip it up for England's U21 side last summer. But I expected it to be at Man City.

Click and follow now!\n\nThe Premier League has announced the eight nominees for the Young Player of the Season award on May 9, 2024.\n\nCole Palmer, an attacker for Chelsea, is leading the list following an incredible season for the Blues. He is a clear favourite to win the award.\n\nThis season, the 22-year-old has racked up nine assists and 21 goals in the league. After Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Palmer is the only Chelsea player with a direct hand in more than 30 goals during their first Premier League season.\n\nPhil Foden, a top player for Manchester City, has improved his consistency this season and has been a standout performer for Pep Guardiola's team. Foden was born in Stockport.\n\nErling Braut Haaland, who has scored 25 goals this season -- four of which came in his most recent match against Wolverhampton Wanderers to support City's title defense -- is another hero in City's attempt to make history.\n\nWilliam Saliba and Bukayo Saka of Arsenal have been crucial to the Gunners' success this season. This season, the England international has helped Arsenal to the top of the league with 16 goals and nine assists.\n\nKobbie Mainoo of Manchester United is an unexpected addition.

Kinda boring to see certain players dominate every year.\"\n\nAnother made the suggestion: \"It should be an award for players in their first pro season playing over X amount of games (maybe 1000 minutes?)\"\n\nA third pointed out: \"So you are telling me Jude [Bellingham] could win the Champions League this year come to the prem and win this award for the next 3 seasons.\"\n\nWhile there were a lot of good points made on the original post, the main suggestion from fans was to lower the age cap from 23 to 21.\n\nDespite the interesting suggestions, the awards will go ahead as normal this season, with Haaland looking to secure his second win in a row.\n\nThe City striker's teammate Foden is also a nominee for the main Player of the Season award, after his pivotal performances in the Cityzen's charge towards their potential fourth consecutive Premier League trophy.\n\nHaaland, Palmer and Isak are also in the running for the main award.\n\nThe winner, decided by a public vote and a Premier League panel, will be announced on May 18.\n\nRead more:", "source": {"uri": "sportsjoe.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsJOE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_kelly@sportsjoe.ie", "name": "Simon Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_Udogie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Destiny Udogie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Saliba", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Saliba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors_and_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors and Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://d1ur8kxvk6cuvz.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/05/Site-header-2024-05-09T171257.183.png?height=720&width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 2143, "textEnd": 2149}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The remaining nominees are Newcastle's Alexander Isak, Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer, Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.\n\nHowever, there are a number of players who have not been nominated and can feel aggrieved after missing out on the eight-man shortlist. They include the likes of Bukayo Saka and Rodri.\n\nHere, Mirror Football have taken a look at six players who could have easily been shortlisted for the Player of the Year prize, having enjoyed successful seasons for their respective clubs.\n\nMohamed Salah\n\nIt does feel strange that Mohamed Salah is even in this conversation, considering the numbers he has produced so far this season. Yes, he has not been at his flying best for Liverpool in recent months, but the Egyptian has still produced 18 goals and 10 assists in just 30 league appearances.\n\nHe is one of just three players that have produced double figures for goals and assists this term, with Ollie Watkins and Anthony Gordon the other two. Salah has previously won the award twice, with the most recent coming during the 2021/22 season.\n\nGabriel\n\nArsenal have the best defensive record in the Premier League this season, so it does feel harsh that there are no defenders from the Gunners among the nominees. There is an argument to be made for Ben White, William Saliba and David Raya to make this list, but Gabriel is the one that gets the nod.\n\nAfter not starting any of their first three matches - a period which saw them concede four goals - Gabriel was recalled for their game against Manchester United and he has not looked back ever since. The Brazilian has started in 32 of their last 33 league matches, scoring four important goals.\n\nHe has been part of an Arsenal team that has conceded just 28 goals in the Premier League, with the Gunners keeping a league-high 17 clean sheets thus far.\n\nGabriel has not been included in the Player of the Year nominees Rodri\n\nUnbeaten in his last 66 top-flight matches, Rodri is the outright record holder for the amount of consecutive appearances without defeat in the Premier League. City have lost the three games Rodri has not featured in this season due to suspension and his impact is pivotal.\n\nDespite this, the 27-year-old has not been nominated for the Player of the Year prize. It's a shock, especially as he has accumulated the most accurate passes, most final third entries and has chipped in with seven goals and nine assists. Not bad for a defensive midfielder.\n\nBukayo Saka\n\nLike Salah, it does not feel like Bukayo Saka has been at his best this season. But when you break it down, he has enjoyed a fine campaign with 16 goals and nine assists in 34 Premier League appearances. The 22-year-old needs one more goal contribution during the final two league matches to beat last season's tally.\n\nHe is Arsenal's top scorer and has helped spearhead their push for the Premier League title. The England international, who was nominated for the award last season, has been left out this time with Odegaard and Rice the two Gunners representatives on the shortlist.\n\nBukayo Saka has been in sensational form for Arsenal Dominic Solanke\n\nHaving showed signs of improvement last season, Dominic Solanke has taken his game to a whole new level this season and is currently the joint-fifth top scorer in the Premier League. The Bournemouth forward has fired home 18 goals in 36 appearances, averaging a goal every 178 minutes.\n\nThat is his best top-flight return by a country mile and Solanke is unfortunate not to get nominated, especially as he is playing in a much weaker team compared to likes of Haaland and Watkins. Although Solanke is not included, he will be hoping he is chosen for the England squad this summer.\n\nDominic Solanke has scored 18 Premier League goals this season Jarrod Bowen\n\nAlthough West Ham's campaign is petering out fast, Jarrod Bowen can hold some pride for his performances across the season. The former Hull forward has notched 16 goals and six assists in 33 league appearances and he is pushing to make Gareth Southgate's Three Lions squad this summer.\n\nAs well as his usual right wing berth Bowen has played league matches at centre forward this season but that has had no reduction on his level of performances. The 27-year-old showed exactly what he is capable of in the recent 2-2 draw against Liverpool, grabbing a goal and an assist.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!

He is trying to be part of the first team to win four straight Premier League titles..\n\nErling Haaland - Man City\n\nLast year's winner has scored 25 goals and assisted five more in only 28 Premier League appearances in a stop-start campaign for the Norwegian. He is leading the race for the Golden Boot and is one of only three players with 30 goal involvements this season.\n\nAlexander Isak - Newcastle\n\nThe 24-year-old Swede is nominated for a second straight season after scoring 20 goals in just 27 league appearances for Newcastle - the first Magpies player since Alan Shearer in 2002-03 to reach that milestone.\n\nMartin Odegaard - Arsenal\n\nThe Arsenal skipper has led by example during their title challenge.

Likewise, Alexander Isak and Ollie Watkins have been outstanding in very different teams, while Virgil van Dijk, Martin Odegaard and Declan Rice all get the nods as Manchester City's closest title contenders.\n\nYet perhaps the two best players in the league this season have gone unnoticed: Rodri for City, Bukayo Saka for Arsenal.\n\nThe former has undoubtedly been more key to Pep Guardiola than Foden. Still on that bonkers unbeaten run, the Spaniard's absences this season have coincided with City's losses, proving his importance - but his all-round level of performance has arguably risen even further.\n\nIt's not an award for all competitions - but is it any wonder that City became a real force in Europe when Rodri became the fulcrum? Like Saka, he carries more responsibility than anyone else in that side - and like Saka, he's almost burned himself out to make himself available for every minute possible.\n\nIt's odd: Foden gets the nod over Rodri for City, but Rice gets it over Saka for Arsenal, despite the fact the England man has more goals and assists than anyone else in that team. Despite the fact that he has been the most consistent, indispensable attacker for Mikel Arteta. Despite the fact he's arguably the best right-winger in the world right now.\n\nThere's a simple explanation. While Foden was used sparingly in the Treble run, he's ascended to a new level of importance. Rice, too, has been excellent - but his nomination is perhaps more down to the pleasant surprise that he's been this good than his status as one of the world's best defensive midfielders.\n\nRuben Dias won this award, after all, for \"fixing\" Guardiola's defence. Mohamed Salah for his blockbuster debut season, Virgil van Dijk for his first full campaign at Liverpool. It's easier to be wowed by something new, after all.\n\nAll while continued excellence sometimes goes under the radar. It feels odd to have neither Rodri nor Saka in the running for this award - but it's more of a show of what we expect from them than their performances.\n\nThomas Tuchel has ignited rumours over a potential Premier League return with Manchester United, while Juan Mata has opened up on his dramatic Chelsea exit to Old Trafford.", "source": {"uri": "fourfourtwo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fourfourtwo.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_white@fourfourtwo.com", "name": "Mark White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWA_Footballer_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FWA Footballer of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFA_Players'_Player_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PFA Players' Player of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Dias", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Dias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Salah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Salah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mata", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Mata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qgG6sudgq8ZXg3Pxvu2Q33-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Rice, who captained West Ham to Europa Conference League glory before joining the Gunners, has excelled since his \u00a3105m move.\n\nThree of the other four nominees have been prolific in front of goal, with Isak, Palmer and Watkins starring for their respective clubs.

to a close and the annual awards are due to be decided ahead of the closing fixtures on 19 May.\n\nEight of the division's top stars have been nominated for the coveted Player of the Season prize but there are some notable absences from the list.\n\nCheck out our other stories here:\n\nVinicius Junior focused on Real Madrid amid Ballon d'Or claims\n\nDyche keen for Everton to finish strong at home\n\nJorginho extends Arsenal stay with new contract until 2025\n\nOne of Erling Haaland, Phil Foden, Martin Odegaard, Cole Palmer, Alexander Isak, Declan Rice, Virgil van Dijk and Ollie Watkins will be crowned after impressing for their sides but the reveal has left many fans on social media furious with the decision-making process.\n\nNot everyone can be selected for the award although the numbers suggest there have been some obvious errors made by those with the power of selection.\n\nWe look at five Premier League players deserving of a spot on the Player of the Season shortlist.\n\nArsenal's starboy is one goal away from matching his 17-goal haul from the 2022-23 campaign and although he has not been at his absolute best this term, he has played a massive part in mounting the club's title challenge.\n\nThe 22-year-old has 25 goal contributions in 34 Premier League appearances and is the club's top scorer.\n\nAfter making the list last year, he has been replaced by Odegaard and Rice as Arsenal's representatives in 2023-24.\n\nHis consistency and availability despite being on the end of several heavy challenges every match embodies the spirit and fight the Gunners have developed under Mikel Arteta and his absence as a nominee is undoubtedly harsh.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking absentee from the Player of the Season list is Man City midfielder Rodri.\n\nNo player in the competition has more passes or touches than the Spanish international and he remains unbeaten in every league match he has featured in this term.\n\nOn top of his solid defensive work for the champions, Rodri also has seven goals and nine assists under Pep Guardiola.\n\nShould City win their fourth consecutive title, it will seem an odd omission considering his influence in the heart of midfield.\n\nBournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has been nominated for the Manager of the Season award, but prolific goalscorer Dominic Solanke has missed out on a Player of the Season nomination.\n\nThe in-form Cherry has enjoyed his best campaign in front of goal, scoring 18 goals in 36 appearances and averaging a goal every 178 minutes.\n\nAn England call-up is not out of the question for the 26-year-old ahead of Euro 2024 but Harry Kane's presence upfront will make it difficult for Solanke to get many minutes on the pitch for his country.\n\nAs the league's fifth top scorer, he will feel aggrieved that his performances have not been given the recognition they deserved.\n\nLiverpool's title challenge may have faltered but Mohamed Salah's brilliance in the final third has not.\n\nDespite his recent injury and slow road back to his best for the Merseyside club, he still has 18 goals and 10 assists in the Premier League.\n\nHe is one of three players to reach double figures for goals and assists in the top flight this season which is impressive considering he has not featured that much in 2024.\n\nSalah is a two-time winner of the Player of the Season award but will not have the chance to earn a third in Jurgen Klopp's last campaign as Reds boss.\n\nHalf of Arsenal's squad could have been included on the Player of the Season shortlist but alongside Saka, defender Gabriel will probably feel disappointed not to have been included.\n\nThe Brazilian has been part of a defence that boasts the best record in the division - keeping 17 clean sheets and conceding just 28 goals.\n\nAlongside William Saliba, he forms one-half of the most formidable defensive partnerships in the world and he has also popped up with four important goals for the Gunners.\n\nHe certainly gives Van Dijk a run for his money when it comes to discussing the best centre-backs this season.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Who gets your vote as the BEST performer of 2023/24?\n\nEight players have been shortlisted for the 2023/24 EA SPORTS Player of the Season award, and you can help to decide who wins.\n\nYou, the fans, have until 12:00 BST on Monday 13 May to vote for your favourite via the EA SPORTS website.\n\nThe public votes will be combined with those of a panel of football experts to decide the winner, who will be revealed on Saturday 18 May.\n\nPhil Foden (Man City)\n\nP32 W22 D7 L3 G16 A8\n\nThe 23-year-old Academy graduate has been one of 2023/24's standout midfielders. He has been utilised in a more central attacking role by Pep Guardiola this season, directly contributing to 24 goals, including two hat-tricks, in Manchester City's push to be the first team to win four consecutive Premier League titles.\n\nErling Haaland (Man City)\n\nP28 W19 D6 L3 G25 A5\n\nThis season's top scorer has netted 25 times in just 28 appearances to sit four clear in the race for the Castrol Golden Boot. The 23-year-old has set up five goals for his team-mates, making him one of only three players this season to reach 30 goal involvements.\n\nAlexander Isak (Newcastle)\n\nP27 W13 D2 L12 G20 A1\n\nThe Swedish striker has 21 goal involvements in only 27 matches. Isak, 24, is the first Newcastle player since Alan Shearer in 2002/03 to reach 20 goals in a Premier League season, while his minutes-per-goal rate of 101.3 is second only to Haaland's 91.8 among players with more than two goals.\n\nMartin Odegaard (Arsenal)\n\nP33 W24 D5 L4 G8 A8\n\nArsenal's captain has led by example this season as the Gunners continue their pursuit for a first league title in 20 years. The 25-year-old has scored eight goals, assisted eight goals and created 94 chances, the second most in the league, while also being a key part of their pressing game.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea)\n\nP31 W14 D8 L9 G21 A9\n\nPalmer, 22, has had a remarkable debut campaign at Stamford Bridge after joining from Man City. He has matched Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard's Chelsea record of 16 home Premier League goals in a season, while also becoming only the third player in history to reach 30+ goal involvements in a PL season while aged 21 or younger, after Robbie Fowler and Chris Sutton.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal)\n\nP36 W26 D5 L5 G7 A8\n\nRice, 25, has enjoyed a superb debut campaign for Arsenal since signing from West Ham United. Mikel Arteta has transformed him from a holding midfielder into a superb box-to-box player, as shown by Rice directly contributing to 15 goals while also making 79 tackles and 43 interceptions.\n\nVirgil van Dijk (Liverpool)\n\nP34 W21 D9 L4 G2 A2 CS8\n\nLiverpool's Dutch centre-back has been back to his best in Jurgen Klopp's final season at the club. The 32-year-old has made the third most passes in the league and been dribbled past only twice all season, while his 186 duels won are the second most of any centre-back.\n\nOllie Watkins (Aston Villa)\n\nP35 W20 D7 L8 G19 A12\n\nThe Aston Villa striker, 28, has the most goal involvements in the league. His 19 goals put him fourth in the race for the Golden Boot, while his 12 assists put him two clear in the hunt for the Castrol Playmaker award.\n\nSee: EVERY EA SPORTS Player of the Season winner",

Injuries have prevented City's hitman from matching the unfathomable heights of last season but he still leads the Golden Boot charge.\n\nHe'll have to fend off competition from City teammate Phil Foden, who is also battling Haaland for the Young Player of the Season award. The Cityzens have won this award for the last four years - Kevin De Bruyne has two either side of Ruben Dias' triumph in 2020/21 - and will fancy their chances of adding a fifth.\n\nNewcastle United striker Alexander Isak has enjoyed another impressive season in front of goal. Despite missing a period through injury, he has still broken the 20-goal mark and become the first Newcastle player to reach that tally since Alan Shearer.\n\nMartin Odegaard has captained Arsenal as Mikel Arteta's side took another step forwards in their quest to win the title. He has created the second-most chances in the division this year but has also earned plenty of praise for his work off the ball as well.\n\nOdegaard has company on the shortlist in the form of midfield teammate Declan Rice, whose \u00a3105m move from West Ham United looks like a bargain. He began the season as a holding midfielder but has come into his own in a box-to-box role which has helped Rice boost his goals and assists numbers.\n\nChelsea's Cole Palmer has earned a place on the shortlist after his dazzling debut year at Stamford Bridge. Arriving with low expectations, the 21-year-old has reached 30 goal involvements and is expected to earn a spot in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.\n\nVirgil van Dijk, the winner from 2018/19, is back in the running this year. At the time of writing, he has been dribbled past just twice all season, steering Liverpool back towards the top of the table in Jurgen Klopp's final year.\n\nThe final name on the shortlist is Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins, whose production in 2023/24 has been nothing short of sensational. His 19 goals and 12 assists appear to have fired Unai Emery's side to a spot in the top four and ended the debate over who will provide cover for Harry Kane in Gareth Southgate's England squad.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Player of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Dias", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Dias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1915,h_1077,x_5,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hxefr2w6z393pv37a7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

United have suffered a wretched season with Erik ten Hag's men looking likely to miss out on qualification for European competitions altogether next season.\n\nThe majority of Ten Hag's squad have underperformed badly throughout the campaign, leading to a record 13 losses in the league and an embarrassing early exit from the Champions League.\n\nHowever, one plus point from the season has been the emergence of young midfielder, Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nMainoo has been a mainstay in the starting XI since his first game of the season at Goodison Park in November, excelling in the middle of the park despite the team's poor form all around him.\n\nHis wonderful breakthrough campaign has not gone unnoticed, with United's No 37 getting nominated for the Premier League's Young Player of the Season award.\n\nThe Englishman grabbed his first goal for his boyhood club in the third round of the FA Cup against Newport, following it up with a couple of stunning strikes in the Premier League.\n\nHis ridiculous stoppage-time winner in the pulsating 4-3 win against Wolves won the Premier League Goal of the Month award for February, showcasing all of his attributes with a stunning run and finish.\n\nMainoo then put United ahead in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool at Old Trafford, his outstanding curling effort ensured a point and helped put an end to the old enemy's title hopes in the process.\n\nThe academy product also made his bow for England in a friendly against Brazil at Wembley, impressing on the big stage and now looking a certainty for the Three Lions squad for the Euros in the summer.\n\nAlongside his incredible talent with the ball, Mainoo's temperament is perhaps the most impressive thing about the young man.\n\nAt just 19, Mainoo's composure in possession and unflappable nature under pressure will be key to him starring for United for many years to come.\n\nIt's imperative United now build their midfield around the new star and with a summer of changes expected at the club, tying Mainoo down to a long term contract should be high on the INEOS to-do-list.\n\nWinning the prestigious award would be the icing on the cake after a wonderful breakthrough campaign but the United man does face stiff competition for the gong.\n\nManchester City pair, Phil Foden and Erling Haaland will be among the favourites with Chelsea's Cole Palmer also in the running.\n\nNewcastle's Alexander Isak, Tottenham Hotspur's Destiny Udogie and Arsenal duo Bukayo Saka and William Saliba make up the remaining nominees.\n\nWhatever the outcome, Mainoo has every

The Premier League have revealed their nominees for this season's Young Player of the Year award and to say it's strong would be something of an understatement.\n\nNewcastle United's Alexander Isak is rightly among the candidates, rubbing shoulders with the elite of Erling Haaland, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Cole Palmer and more. No arguments there, of course. The list for player of the season has yet to be announced, but you would imagine it will bare an uncanny similarity.\n\nBut surely there's a name missing. Has there been some sort of clerical error? Anthony Gordon's absence from the list is a glaring oversight after an incredible season for the Magpies forward.\n\nREAD MORE: Alexander Isak nominated for Premier League award\n\nREAD MORE: Johanes Spors interviewed for top Newcastle role\n\nOf course there has to be a limit, or course we're biased and of course the players shortlisted have all had hugely impressive seasons. But if Kobbie Manoo's 20 Premier League appearances have warranted a place in the list then Gordon's ten goals and ten assists at the very highest level surely earns him a spot?\n\nGordon, like Mainoo, has broken into the England squad this season, impressing on his debut against Brazil and cameo role against Belgium. After last summer's European U21 Championship success for his country - he was named player of the tournament no less - he has stepped things up a gear for Newcastle.\n\nHis goals have come against some of the very best too - scoring against Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United. He's no flat-track bully.\n\nYou could argue that no one has done more for United all season. He has been consistency personified, and not just seven-out-of-ten consistency, we're talking about performing at the very highest level, week-in, week-out. He has a huge future ahead of him, with a place in Gareth Southgate's squad for this summer's Euros looking likely, and a key role still to play in Newcastle's push for a European spot.\n\nGordon is hugely motivated and has spoken of his drive to succeed already this season. Maybe this 'snub' will spur him on to even greater achievements - and that can only be a good thing for Newcastle United.", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stuart_jamieson@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Stuart Jamieson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gordon_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Gordon (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29084266.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gordon1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552703", "eventUri": "eng-9552703", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Abbott's Operation Lone Star, Texas' dangerous razor wire placed along the border has been responsible for dozens of injuries, leaving people with severe lacerations in their hands, arms, and legs. National Guard soldiers have shot pepper balls leaving welts and bruises and resulting in eye, nose, and throat irritation. This same cruelty and disastrous operations have also funneled into border and interior communities in Texas via high-speed chases, which have been linked to 74 deaths and 198 injuries.\n\nThis Executive Order is nothing less than a policy of attrition that will result in undocumented immigrants fearing to seek out medical attention and a shameless attempt to make the state of Texas a hostile place for our communities.

Greg Abbott signed an executive order on Thursday that requires public hospitals in Texas to collect information on the immigration status of patients so that the hospitals can then track costs incurred for the care of undocumented migrants.\n\nPrevious guidance for public hospitals did not include questions about immigration status. The executive order would mandate the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to collect this information so that the state of Texas could then bill the federal government.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Governor Abbott said in a statement on Thursday. \"Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nThe order requires that public hospitals in Texas collect information regarding the costs of medical care provided to undocumented immigrants starting Nov 1, 2024. Direct covered hospitals would have to report data to the state health commission quarterly, beginning in March 2025.\n\n\"This would be a new requirement, and we are reviewing it as quickly as possible,\" said Carrie Williams, spokesperson for the Texas Hospital Association. \"Right now, hospitals don't ask about patient immigration status as a condition of treatment. Hospitals are required by law to provide life-saving treatment to anyone, regardless of ability to pay or status.\"\n\nThe association will be in a better position to answer additional questions once they've had more time to analyze the order, Williams said.\n\nDisclosure: Texas Hospital Association has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Abbott instructs hospitals to collect data on patients' immigration status", "body": "Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered hospitals in the Lone Star State to ask patients about their immigration status in order to ascertain the costs of providing medical care to people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThrough an executive order, Abbott directed Texas hospitals to compile data on inpatient discharges and emergency visits by immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization, as well as on the costs of providing medical services to this population.\n\nAbbott instructed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to require hospitals to start collecting the information on Nov. 1 and to provide regular reports to state authorities.\n\nThe order applies to hospitals enrolled in Medicaid and the Children Health Insurance Program, as well as other health care centers identified by the commission.\n\nTo justify the move, Abbott cited the record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, claiming that Texas was shouldering the economic burden of providing medical services to migrants entering the country illegally.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nAbbott's directive said hospitals should tell patients the new information collection \"will not affect patient care.\" He noted in his order that federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency treatment to any individual, irrespective of their immigration status.\n\nStill, Abbott's order is likely to be decried by immigration rights advocates, who have said similar policies have had a chilling effect on immigrants, discouraging them from accessing medical care out of fear of legal repercussions.\n\nDemocrat Rep. Sylvia Garcia of Texas condemned the order, accusing Abbott of \"social engineering\" and seeking \"to make ICE officers out of doctors providing immigrants with medical care.\"\n\n\"People are allowed to get care regardless of their citizenship,\" said Julia Gelatt, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank in Washington. \"But we know that asking questions can make people worried about immigration consequences and whether or not it's safe to seek care.\"\n\nIn his order, Abbott suggested Texas would seek to get the federal government to reimburse the state for these expenses, though it is unclear how, or if, that would happen.\n\nThursday's action by Texas is the latest example of Republican-led states enacting stricter immigration laws and measures. Last year, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a harsh immigration state law that, among other things, requires hospitals to collect information on patients' immigration status.\n\nLed by Texas, several red states have also passed laws that seek to criminalize unauthorized immigration at the state level and empower state officials to prosecute suspected violators. Those state laws have been challenged in federal court by the Justice Department, which has noted that immigration policy has long been the responsibility of the federal government.\n\nAt Abbott's direction, Texas has mounted an aggressive political and legal challenge to the Biden administration on immigration. The state, for example, has filed lawsuits against virtually every major immigration action by President Biden.\n\nAbbott has also ordered state officials to bus tens of thousands of migrants to Democratic-led cities, tasked the state National Guard with fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and instructed state troopers to arrest migrants on trespassing charges.", "source":

Major cities across the country - such as Denver, Chicago and New York City - have annually shelled out millions caring for the many asylum seekers descending into their jurisdictions.\n\nAbbott, who leads a state that shares the largest portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, has positioned himself as a leading figure in the GOP fight against the Biden-Harris administration's border policies with the launch of his Operation Lodestar initiative and other lawsuits.\n\nWhile it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cost of providing emergency and other medical care for illegal migrants, given many states don't ask for legal status, some estimates put the price tag into the billions.

Abbott directs hospitals to collect immigration status of patients", "body": "Aug. 9 (UPI) -- Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott has signed an executive order directing hospitals to collect the immigration status of patients and report healthcare costs incurred by undocumented immigrants to the state.\n\nThe Republican governor signed the order Thursday, his latest targeting migrants in his protracted feud with President Joe Biden over policies concerning the southern border.\n\nStarting Nov. 1, hospitals and other medical providers will be required to collect the immigration status of patients and the costs of medical care provided to undocumented immigrants. The data is then to be reported quarterly to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The initial submission is due March 1.\n\nThe order states that hospitals are to inform patients that federal law mandates that their response to questions concerning their immigration status will not affect patient care.\n\nIn a statement, Abbot said Texans should not have to pay for the healthcare of \"illegal immigrants\" while suggesting that the data collected will be used to force the federal government to cover the costs.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" he said.\n\n\"Texas will hold the Biden-Harris administration accountable for the consequences of their open border policies, and we will fight to ensure that they pay back Texas for their costly and dangerous policies.\"\n\nThe Texas Hospital Association, the main advocate for the state's hospitals and healthcare system, said Thursday that they are reviewing the order \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Right now, hospitals don't ask about patient immigration status as a condition of treatment. Hospitals are required by law to provide life-saving treatment to anyone, regardless of ability to pay or status,\" the association said in a statement.\n\nBiden has been plagued for much of his administration by GOP criticism over his handling of the southern border, with Abbott being among the most vocal critics.\n\nThe Republican governor has responded to most of Biden's border policies with lawsuits and initiated Operation Lone Star, which deployed the Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Safety to the souther border. He has also been bussing tens of thousands of migrants to Democrat-led states.\n\nHowever, the move by Abbott comes as Biden administration policies have seen encounters at the southern border plummet in recent months. According to U.S. Custom and Border Patrol statistics, there were 83,536 arrests between ports of entry in June, making it the lowest monthly total of the Biden administration.\n\nRep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, called on the governor to focus instead on families in the state, gun violence in schools and the energy grid.\n\n\"Our MAGA Republican governor just can't stop social engineering,\" she said in a statement on X.\n\n\"First, he wants doctors and nurses to police women's choices for reproductive care, then he wants to make criminals out of parents who support their child in seeking gender-affirming care and now he wants to make ICE officers out of doctors providing immigrants with medical care. When will it stop?\"\n\nMAGA is the acronym the far-right Make America Great Again nativist political movement, made popular by former President Donald Trump.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com",

Greg Abbott signed an executive order requiring hospitals to collect data on the healthcare costs of undocumented migrants treated in the state.\n\nThe order will mean that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) must \"assess costs to the Texas public hospital system imposed by the federal government's open-border policies.\"\n\nHealthcare officials who treat undocumented migrants will be forced to collect and send information on those patients' citizenship status to the state, according to the executive order that Abbott signed on Thursday.\n\nHHSC will direct healthcare providers to collect the costs associated with care for undocumented migrants beginning on November 1.\n\nHHSC must provide regular reports to state authorities, according to the order. The state government will require quarterly reports on the costs, with annual reports directed to the governor's office.\n\n\"Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott said.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration does not employ open border policies. However, Republican lawmakers have commonly deployed this attack line during the presidential election.\n\nAbbott cited the influx of migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border and said they impose burdens on the local healthcare services and increase \"the costs of medical care for all Texans.\"\n\nHealth officials fear the order may deter migrants from seeking urgent medical attention.\n\n\"It's going to discourage people from seeking medical care that otherwise are going to need it. And whether you're legal or not, if you're having an emergency or a medical problem, you're a human being, and you need to be seen,\" Hidalgo County Health Director Dr. Ivan Melendez told Border Report.\n\nThe order signed by the Texas governor is the latest string of stand-offs between Abbott and the Biden-Harris administration over matters concerning immigration policy and border security.\n\nIn 2021, Abbott announced Operation Lone Star to stop migrants from entering the U.S. unlawfully. It has led to the apprehension of 516,300 illegal immigrants and more than 45,300 arrests since its launch.\n\nOperation Lone Star has been challenged in the courts, including a back-and-forth over a floating blockade Texas officials placed in the Rio Grande.\n\nA Texas court ruled last month that a floating barrier in the Rio Grande meant to discourage migrants from crossing into the state can remain.\n\nThe ruling by the 5th Circuit appeals court on July 30 dealt a blow to the Biden administration's attempt to remove the floating barrier placed there by the state of Texas.\n\nAnd human rights groups say that immigrants trying to cross the United States-Mexico border in Texas are being shoved into razor wire and fired at with pepper balls by those working under Abbott's Operation Lone Star.\n\nAbbott has also hit out at Vice President Kamala Harris, saying she \"couldn't trouble herself\" to visit the border.\n\nHarris has been under increasing pressure over what Republicans view as a lack of leadership surrounding immigration policy.\n\nImmigration is one of the key issues in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election as former President Donald Trump faces off against Harris.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billal_rahman@newsweek.com", "name": "Billal Rahman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Greg Abbott (R) on Thursday signed an executive order requiring hospitals to record the immigration status of patients starting later this year, in a bid to assess costs that the state incurs by providing care to people lacking permanent legal status.\n\nOn social media, Abbott vowed to make Democratic President Joe Biden's administration reimburse Texas for its \"costly\" border policies.\n\n\"Texans should NOT have to foot the bill for illegal immigrants healthcare,\" the governor wrote.\n\nUnder federal law, hospitals are not allowed to deny emergency care to any individual, regardless of their immigration status or ability to cover the cost of treatment.\n\nAbbott said this results in Texans ultimately bearing \"the costs associated with public financial support for medical care for individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States, in the form of higher taxes.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, starting Nov. 1, 2024, hospitals in the state will be required to log the number of inpatient discharges and emergency visits by such immigrants, as well as the costs associated with providing care to them. The newly signed order also calls for hospitals to report the data quarterly to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, with the first submissions due by March 1, 2025.\n\nAdditionally, hospitals will be mandated to present an annual report on the cost of care for these immigrants to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the state House starting in January 2026.\n\nAbbott said hospitals should let patients know that the information they collect won't affect the care they provide.\n\nThe Texas Hospital Association, an industry group, said in a press release that it is currently reviewing the executive order.\n\nThe new directive has already drawn criticism from Democrats, including Texas Rep. Sylvia Garcia.\n\n\"Here we go again! @GovAbbott yet again social engineering and targeting immigrants. Just unacceptable,\" Garcia wrote on social media, mentioning a handle used by Abbott.\n\n\"He should focus on issues that matter to Texas families like making sure our kids are safe from gun violence in school and fixing our damn grid.\"\n\nAbbott, who has frequently sparred with the Biden administration on immigration, did not commit to working with Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, to make progress on the issue if they win the White House in the November election.\n\n\"As governor of the largest border state, I've got to tell you, that ticket is very frightening,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday. \"As bad as Joe Biden has been on the border, Harris-Walz will be even worse.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Health_and_Human_Services_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Health and Human Services Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvia Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_states_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border states (American Civil War)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Disabilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/66b619cf25000033000494ac.jpeg?cache=pddwIYLhBi&ops=1200_630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802987", "eventUri": "eng-9802987", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Greg Abbott on Thursday issued an executive order requiring hospitals to report the annual costs of care for illegal migrants so the state can seek reimbursement from the federal government.\n\nThe Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) is directed to collect information on illegal migrants who use state hospitals for emergency and inpatient care, according to the executive order. These costs will be reported every year to Abbott's office and the Texas Legislature in order for state officials to demand reimbursement from the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nThe Republican governor places direct blame on the White House's \"reckless open border policies\" for the high medical care costs.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott stated in a press release. \"Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants.\"\n\n\"That is why today I issued an Executive Order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to collect and report healthcare costs for illegal immigrants in our state,\" the governor continued. \"Texas will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for the consequences of their open border policies, and we will fight to ensure that they pay back Texas for their costly and dangerous policies.\"\n\nHospitals are to begin collecting information on illegal migrant medical care costs by November 1 and to report their data quarterly, according to the order. Beginning in 2026, hospitals would then begin reporting their data annually to the governor, lieutenant governor, and Texas House speaker.\n\nHowever, patients will also be informed that, under federal law, any response to legal status will not affect patient care, according to the order.\n\nAbbott's order follows an ongoing border crisis that has had more than 7 million foreign nationals illegally cross into the U.S. since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, according to the latest Customs and Border Protection data. Major cities across the country - such as Denver, Chicago, and New York City - have annually shelled out millions caring for the many asylum seekers descending into their jurisdictions.\n\nAbbott, who leads a state that shares the largest portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, has positioned himself as a leading figure in the GOP fight against the Biden-Harris administration's border policies with the launch of his Operation Lodestar initiative and other lawsuits.\n\nWhile it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cost of providing emergency and other medical care for illegal migrants, given many states don't ask for legal status, some estimates put the price tag into the billions. A 2023 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) put total federal medical expenditures at more than $23 billion and estimated state medical expenditures to be more than $18 billion.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Greg Abbott issued an executive order on Aug. 8 requiring that hospitals collect data on patients living illegally in the United States and report the costs of medical services provided to them.\n\nIn a statement, Abbott said he aims to collect data on illegal immigrants who use public hospitals so that Texas can seek reimbursement from the federal government for their medical expenses.\n\n\"Texas will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for the consequences of their open border policies, and we will fight to ensure that they pay back Texas for their costly and dangerous policies,\" the Republican governor stated.\n\nHospitals will need to report the information to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) by March 1, 2025, and continue reporting data on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe executive order also requires that hospitals inform patients that, under federal law, their responses to questions about their immigrant status will not affect patient care.\n\nIt stated that HHSC will need to report annually to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the House speaker on the preceding year's costs for medical care provided to illegal immigrants starting Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nAbbott said that people in Texas should not have to \"shoulder the burden\" of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants.\n\nThe Epoch Times has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\nThe Texas Hospital Association (THA), representing over 85 percent of the state's acute-care hospitals and health care systems, said that it is reviewing Abbott's executive order \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Right now, hospitals don't ask about patient immigration status as a condition of treatment,\" THA said in a statement. \"Hospitals are required by law to provide life-saving treatment to anyone, regardless of ability to pay or status.\"\n\nAs part of the initiative, state authorities have deployed floating border barriers, installed wire fencing, and used the Texas National Guard to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to the statement, the multi-agency effort has led to over 513,700 illegal immigrant apprehensions and more than 44,000 criminal arrests, with more than 38,600 felony charges so far.\n\nThe Texas governor criticized President Joe Biden's recent executive actions, announced by the White House in June, stating that they \"will do little to stem the flow of illegal immigration into the country.\"\n\n\"As long as the Biden Administration refuses to provide any type of enforcement, any type of blockage, of people crossing illegally, all that this new Biden policy is going to do is to actually attract and invite even more people to cross the border illegally,\" Abbott said in the statement.\n\n\"This ban will remain in place until the number of people trying to enter illegally is reduced to a level that our system can effectively manage,\" Biden said at a news conference on June 4.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 1.44 million encounters with people trying to enter the United States nationwide as of June 2024.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The Executive Order specifically indicates that the term \"Hospitals\" includes \"acute care hospitals enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, and any additional providers identified by the Health and Human Services Commission.\n\nA borderland organization that advocates for migrant's human rights issued a written statement saying the Governor's latest move will put migrants in danger as it could deter them from seeking medical attention.\n\nAttributed to Fernando Garcia, the executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights, the full statement reads:\n\nOnce again, Gov. Abbott is using immigrants as scapegoats for his failed policies and political frustrations, painting a one-sided picture of the realities happening at the border and in the state of Texas. Today, we remind Gov. Abbott that his cruel, inhumane, costly, and unconstitutional border enforcement operations has wasted over $11 billion of taxpayer money in harming asylum seekers, many of whom include children, women, and entire families.\n\nUnder Gov. Abbott's Operation Lone Star, Texas' dangerous razor wire placed along the border has been responsible for dozens of injuries, leaving people with severe lacerations in their hands, arms, and legs. National Guard soldiers have shot pepper balls leaving welts and bruises and resulting in eye, nose, and throat irritation. This same cruelty and disastrous operations have also funneled into border and interior communities in Texas via high-speed chases, which have been linked to 74 deaths and 198 injuries.\n\nThis Executive Order is nothing less than a policy of attrition that will result in undocumented immigrants fearing to seek out medical attention and a shameless attempt to make the state of Texas a hostile place for our communities. Despite recent findings showing that undocumented immigrants paying $96.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in addition to raising over $4.9 billion in tax revenue in the state of Texas, they continue to be the targets of Gov. Abbott's hate agenda.\n\nLas Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center's Executive DirectorMarisa Lim\u00f3n Garza said,\n\nOnce again, Governor Abbott is weaponizing public institutions to enforce cruelty against immigrant families. This is part of a larger pattern of xenophobia and racial discrimination that we must call out.\n\nInstead of taking steps to improve access to adequate healthcare for all Texans, Abbott is wasting time and resources by directing medical staff to focus on the status of the person in their care, proving once again that the governor is comfortable scapegoating migrants for failed public services across Texas.\n\nEl Paso County Commissioner David Stout said migrants in the county pay taxes to some extent and should be entitled to medical care.\n\nStout added, \"It just seems to me that like, what the governor is trying to do is go down the road of continuing to demonize migrants, continuing to scapegoat migrants for problems that you know that are being created by he, and his folks.\"\n\nSign up to receive the top interesting stories from in and around our community once daily in your inbox.", "source": {"uri": "abc7amarillo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVII"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erika_esquivel@abc7amarillo.com", "name": "Erika Esquivel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Telepharmacy_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Telepharmacy Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://abc7amarillo.com/resources/media/3b7dbc18-5778-4553-b9d7-f0fdcbb36ff1-large16x9_GregAbbott.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802987", "eventUri": "eng-9802987", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered hospitals in the Lone Star State to ask patients about their immigration status in order to ascertain the costs of providing medical care to people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThrough an executive order, Abbott directed Texas hospitals to compile data on inpatient discharges and emergency visits by immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization, as well as on the costs of providing medical services to this population.\n\nAbbott instructed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to require hospitals to start collecting the information on Nov. 1 and to provide regular reports to state authorities.\n\nTo justify the move, Abbott cited the record levels of migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, claiming that Texas was shouldering the economic burden of providing medical services to migrants entering the country illegally.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott said in a statement.\n\nAbbott's directive said hospitals should tell patients the new information collection \"will not affect patient care.\" He noted in his order that federal law requires hospitals to provide emergency treatment to any individual, irrespective of their immigration status.\n\nStill, Abbott's order is likely to be decried by immigration rights advocates, who have said similar policies have had a chilling effect on immigrants, discouraging them from accessing medical care out of fear of legal repercussions.\n\nIn his order, Abbott suggested Texas would seek to get the federal government to reimburse the state for these expenses, though it is unclear how, or if, that would happen.\n\nThursday's action by Texas is the latest example of Republican-led states enacting stricter immigration laws and measures. Last year, Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a harsh immigration state law that, among other things, requires hospitals to collect information on patients' immigration status.\n\nLed by Texas, several red states have also passed laws that seek to criminalize unauthorized immigration at the state level and empower state officials to prosecute suspected violators. Those state laws have been challenged in federal court by the Justice Department, which has noted that immigration policy has long been the responsibility of the federal government.\n\nAt Abbott's direction, Texas has mounted an aggressive political and legal challenge to the Biden administration on immigration. The state, for example, has filed lawsuits against virtually every major immigration action by President Biden.\n\nAbbott has also ordered state officials to bus tens of thousands of migrants to Democratic-led cities, tasked the state National Guard with fortifying the banks of the Rio Grande with razor wire and instructed state troopers to arrest migrants on trespassing charges.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Health_and_Human_Services_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Health and Human Services Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Telepharmacy_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Telepharmacy Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/08/ffb830dc-33f3-4f14-8a8b-ee5c531c43e4/thumbnail/1200x630/48595ec2b1c237a86328429e6dba796a/gettyimages-2162461368.jpg?v=0a0c17d349635d55704afd4e16e28fc6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802987", "eventUri": "eng-9802987", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 610, "textEnd": 616}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The Governor was also joined by Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Deputy Director Freeman Martin, Adjutant General of Texas Major General Thomas Suelzer, and Texas Border Czar Mike Banks.\n\nPrior to the press conference, Governor Abbott held a border security briefing for members of the Texas House of Representatives to update them on Texas' unprecedented border security efforts due to President Biden's complete refusal to secure the border and keep Texans -- and Americans -- safe.\n\nDeputy Director Martin, Major General Suelzer, and Border Czar Banks outlined the different tools and strategies deployed by Operation Lone Star to secure the Texas-Mexico border.\n\n\"Deputy Director Martin touted the work DPS has done, mentioning that Texas law enforcement has made more than 39,000 criminal arrests and seized over 458 million lethal doses of fentanyl -- enough to kill every man, woman, and child in America.\n\nMajor General Suelzer then highlighted Texas National Guard soldiers' efforts to defend Texas from the Biden Administration's refusal to secure the border, including taking Shelby Park as a base camp to curb the flow of illegal crossings. Border Czar Banks touted Operation Lone Star's border security measures, pointing to the effective deterrent strategies currently deployed along the Texas-Mexico border that have resulted in low border crossings.\n\nGovernor Abbott was joined by 13 of America's Governors who stand in solidarity with Texas' right to defend itself against President Biden's border crisis. \u25a0", "source":

These costs will be reported every year to Abbott's office and the Texas Legislature in order for state officials to demand reimbursement from the Biden-Harris administration. (RELATED: New Poll Sinks Dems' Hopes That Voters Will Forget All About Kamala Harris' Record On Immigration)\n\nThe Republican governor places direct blame on the White House's \"reckless open border policies\" for the high medical care costs.\n\n\"Due to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' open border policies, Texas has had to foot the bill for medical costs for individuals illegally in the state,\" Abbott stated in a press release. \"Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants.\"\n\n\"That is why today I issued an Executive Order requiring the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to collect and report healthcare costs for illegal immigrants in our state,\" the governor continued. \"Texas will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for the consequences of their open border policies, and we will fight to ensure that they pay back Texas for their costly and dangerous policies.\"\n\nHospitals are to begin collecting information on illegal migrant medical care costs by November 1 and to report their data quarterly, according to the order. Beginning in 2026, hospitals would then begin reporting their data annually to the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker.\n\nHowever, patients will also be informed that, under federal law, any response to legal status will not affect patient care, according to the order.\n\nAbbott's order follows an ongoing border crisis that has had more than 7 million foreign nationals illegally cross into the U.S. since the beginning of the Biden-Harris administration, according to the latest Customs and Border Protection data. Major cities across the country - such as Denver, Chicago and New York City - have annually shelled out millions caring for the many asylum seekers descending into their jurisdictions.\n\nAbbott, who leads a state that shares the largest portion of the U.S.-Mexico border, has positioned himself as a leading figure in the GOP fight against the Biden-Harris administration's border policies with the launch of his Operation Lodestar initiative and other lawsuits.\n\nWhile it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cost of providing emergency and other medical care for illegal migrants, given many states don't ask for legal status, some estimates put the price tag into the billions. A 2023 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) put total federal medical expenditures at more than $23 billion and estimated state medical expenditures to be more than $18 billion.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Abbott directed the Texas Health and Human Services Commission to require state hospitals to document, and report quarterly, the costs of treating \"patients who are not lawfully present in the United States.\" The state agency will begin providing an annual report of costs to the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the Texas House beginning in January 2026.\n\nHospital employees must inform patients that if they are undocumented, it will not affect their ability to receive care, according to the executive order. Luis Figueroa, the chief of legislative affairs for Every Texan, a left-leaning public policy nonprofit, said in a brief phone interview that he feared the executive order could lead migrants to avoid care over fears they will be reported to federal immigration authorities. \"People are going to be hesitant to go to emergency rooms, which only makes our communities less safe when it comes to receiving the care that they need,\" Figueroa said. Kassandra Gonzalez, a staff attorney for the Beyond Borders Program with the Texas Civil Rights Project, said in an email that the executive order is \"xenophobic smoke and mirrors\" because \"there is no evidence that Texas loses money because of undocumented immigrants' healthcare costs.\" Gonzalez pointed to a 2023 study by the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, that found on average immigrants pay more in taxes than they consume in benefits. \"Thus, Abbott's cruel policy is targeting the very people who provide state services - services that we all depend on and use,\" Gonzalez said. A spokeswoman with the Texas Hospital Association said in an emailed statement that Abbott's order is a new requirement and hospitals currently don't ask a patient their immigration status as a condition of treatment.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Health_and_Human_Services_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Health and Human Services Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cato Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libertarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Family Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802987", "eventUri": "eng-9802987", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Greg Abbott on Thursday ordered hospitals that treat undocumented migrants to collect and send future information on their citizenship to the state.\n\nAbbott is requiring that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission \"assess costs to the Texas public hospital system imposed by the federal government's open-border policies,\" according to the executive order that Abbott signed Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"The surge of individuals crossing the southern border has continued,\" Abbott wrote in his executive order. \"Federal law contributes to the growth of uncompensated medical costs by requiring that any individual must be allowed to obtain emergency medical treatment regardless of that individual's immigration status, or willingness or ability to pay for such treatment.\"\n\nHis order requires hospitals to collect information on patients \"who are not lawfully present in the United States\" starting Nov. 1. This includes the number of inpatient discharges and emergency room visits.\n\nMigrant advocates and healthcare professionals reacted with confusion and tell Border Report they fear that this will cause racial profiling, and could deter migrants from seeking medical care.\n\n\"It's going to discourage people from seeking medical care that otherwise are going to need it. And whether you're legal or not, if you're having an emergency or a medical problem, you're a human being and you need to be seen,\" Hidalgo County Health Director Dr. Ivan Melendez told Border Report.\n\nAbbott states that the federal government \"may and should be obligated to reimburse the State of Texas for the costs,\" and indicated that the collection of data is a way for the Lone Star state to, in effect, bill the federal government.\n\nAbbott says hospitals must tell patients that the collection of the information \"will not affect patient care.\"\n\nThe information is to be submitted to the Health and Services Commission quarterly with the first batch of data sent no later than March 1, 2025.\n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2026, the commission is to send the information to the governor, lieutenant governor and Texas Speaker of the House on \"inpatient and emergency care of patients not lawfully present in the United States as reported by hospitals,\" the order states.\n\nHospitals tell Border Report they do not ask patients whether they are U.S. citizens or not, but do ask for identification.\n\nMelendez says migrants who are brought to Texas public hospitals for care by U.S. Border Patrol, Immigration Customs and Enforcement officers or U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, have a card that authorizes the care and all costs to go to the federal government.\n\nHe says he understands, from a fiscal standpoint accounting for costs, but he says the federal government picks up costs for undocumented migrants in federal law enforcement care.\n\nHowever, he says asking other patients for their citizenship information \"is overreaching.\"\n\n\"Medical facilities, especially the physicians, the actual staff that takes care of the patient -- We're already so overburdened with the volume and the acuity of the patient's care that asking us to ascertain a legal status of a patient, regardless of whether we're not going to turn the patient away, regardless of their status. I think for me, it's overreaching,\" Melendez said.\n\n\"I can see his motivation. I can see he's well motivated, that he's trying to take care of the citizens and the well being of everyone. But if you look at it from a pure humanistic perspective, I think it's going to get in the way of delivering health care to those people who are at greatest need, which are the indigent, poor, and especially immigrant, that all that may be here illegally, they're human beings also. So I don't think it's a good idea,\" Melendez said.\n\nGabriel Rosales, Texas State Director for the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, on Thursday told Border Report that this order, in effect makes doctors and healthcare workers law enforcement officers for the border and will promote \"racial profiling.\"\n\n\"That's ludicrous. Right off the bat it's racial profiling,\" Rosales said. \"It's going to immediately intimidate the community, our immigrant community, from trying to get the help that they need. This is completely uncalled for.\n\n\"It is an insult and a slap in the face to Latinos in Texas,\" Rosales said.\n\nRosales said LULAC is meeting with their lawyers and looking at possible court action to try to stop this.\n\nIn West Texas, the El Paso County-run University Medical Center issued a statement saying: \"We are aware of the Executive Order that was issued today by Governor Abbott. We will be reviewing it with our team to fully understand its implications and requirements.\"\n\nLas Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, in El Paso, called the order cruel.\n\n\"Once again, Gov. Abbott is weaponizing public institutions to enforce cruelty against immigrant families. This is part of a larger pattern of xenophobia and racial discrimination that we must call out,\" Las Americas Executive Director Marisa Lim\u00f3n Garza said in a statement. \"Instead of taking steps to improve access to adequate healthcare for all Texans, Abbott is wasting time and resources by directing medical staff to focus on the status of the person in their care, proving once again that the governor is comfortable scapegoating migrants for failed public services across Texas.\"", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Abbott Orders Hospitals to Report Costs of Care for Illegal Immigrants", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nIt's a safe bet that most folks agree that we have a right to know what our tax dollars are being spent on.\n\nIn Texas, Governor Greg Abbott has ordered precisely this, as he has signed an executive order requiring hospitals in the Lone Star State to report the costs of treatments rendered to illegal aliens.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott on Thursday issued an executive order that requires Texas public hospitals to collect information on undocumented immigrants who receive care, including the cost of care, in an effort to get the federal government to pay the state for those costs.\n\nIn a release, Abbott said he issued the order because of what he called President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' \"open border policies.\"\n\nAbbott said the state would be fighting to get the federal government to pay for the medical costs associated with treating undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe order will apply to a range of Texas hospitals and clinics.\n\nThe order applies to hospitals enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program as well as any others identified by the HHSC.\n\nHarris Health, which runs Ben Taub, LBJ and other county health clinics, told KHOU 11 News that it would comply with the order.\n\nKHOU 11 Legal Analyst Carmen Roe said other states and cities have similar laws in place. She also said people in need of care can't be forced to answer a question about immigration status and can't be denied services based on their immigration status.\n\nThis is the right thing to do, whether or not Texas is successful in getting Washington to pick up the tab.\n\nSee Related: Crisis at the Border: Under Biden, at Least 99 Illegals on Terror Watch List Released Into United States\n\nHouse Judiciary Report: How One Illegal Alien Gang Member Was Allowed to Terrorize New York\n\nAs I've said for years, if you don't believe that taxation involves taking your money - your resources - with the implied use of force, try not paying your tax bill and see how long it is before whatever level of government you have stiffed sends men with guns out looking for you. Taxation is not voluntary; it is compulsory and is enforced with the full power of government. As taxpayers who are inextricably bound to this system, the very least we can expect is to know what the various levels of government are spending our money on.\n\nGovernor Abbott, in signing this order, is not only providing this transparency -- he is also revealing the cost of illegal immigration on our strained healthcare system. I've heard first-hand accounts of these strains; my oldest daughter, who has worked in emergency medicine for nearly 20 years, has regaled her mother and me time and again with stories of how illegals use the emergency rooms as a clinic, coming in with everything from hangovers to head colds. And this isn't in Texas; this is in Iowa.\n\nWe not only have a right to know how much money this is costing us -- we should be demanding to know. Governor Abbott's order should be an example for the other 49 states.\n\nFor more up-to-date news on immigration and government spending, as well as politicians, appointed officials, and their shenanigans, please consider upgrading to a VIP account.

Hospitals will also have to track how much money they spend on care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe order requires hospitals to report its findings to the state's Health and Human Services Commission four times a year starting March 1.\n\n\"I very much believe this is a political move that vilifies our immigrant communities,\" Imelda Mejia, with the immigrant advocacy group Texas Rising, said.\n\nMejia worries the new law will make people think twice about seeking treatment.\n\n\"It's going to throw patients for a loop, I think, and we know that immigrant families already have a hard time navigating our health care system,\" she said.\n\nAs noted in the executive order, patients won't be turned away because of their immigration status. Abbott argues that since the state is paying for treatment through Medicaid funding, it has a right to try to recoup the cost from the federal government.\n\n\"It is important to the taxpayers to know how their money is being spent, how much it's costing them, and where that money is going,\" Ira Mehlman with the Federation for American Immigration Reform said.\n\nFlorida enacted a similar law in 2023. The state reports it's spending $148 million a year on health care for undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile hospitals can ask about immigration status, legal experts say you're not required to answer.\n\n\"Even if people don't say if they're in the country illegally, you can make a reasonable deduction here. If people don't have a valid ID,\" Mehlman said.\n\nThe executive order doesn't spell out if that will be an acceptable way for hospitals to gather data.\n\nHarris Health, which operates Ben Taub and LBJ, said it would comply with the law but didn't provide specifics as to how.", "source": {"uri": "queondamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u00a1Que Onda Magazine!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTRK-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KTRK-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_for_American_Immigration_Reform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation for American Immigration Reform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Abbott calls for utility reform after Hurricane Beryl destruction", "body": "AUSTIN, Texas - Governor Greg Abbott says he is ready and willing to drop the hammer on a major Texas power provider.\n\nThe warning came during a one-on-one interview with FOX 7. Governor Abbott wants utility providers to be storm ready and will make an example out of Houston's utility provider, CenterPoint.\n\nWhen Hurricane Beryl made landfall near Houston as a Cat 1 storm, more than two million utility customers lost power. Officials at CenterPoint were criticized for not being prepared and not being fast enough to get the lights back on.\n\nLast week, Governor Abbott rejected the utility's plan to make repairs and upgrades, calling CenterPoint's place inadequate. The utility has to come up with a new plan by the end of the month. If the deadline is missed, the Governor said he will force the company to put in the changes he wants.\n\n\"I said, well, you are not doing enough, and you're not fast enough, because we could have another tropical storm here in a week or two. So, I gave them a deadline of August 31 to get all of this fixed, and they said, yes, they will do it,\" said Governor Abbott.\n\nThe \"proof will be in the pudding,\" Abbott said when asked if he believed CenterPoint would follow through.\n\n\"If they don't. Here's what they know. I will use my Executive Authority, under the Emergency Authority the governor has, to impose those restrictions on them. They know I have that hammer. They know that I'm willing to use that hammer if they fail to do it on their own,\" said Abbott.\n\nThe governor also spoke to FOX 7 about presidential politics and the border. Abbott is not backing down on how he is trying to secure the south Texas border. Abbott said he has already started thinking about what new measures he will have to put in place if the Democratic presidential ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz wins the election.\n\n\"I got to tell you, I'm very concerned and frightened to see a ticket that could impose open border policies that are even more extreme than what Biden has allowed in the United States,\" said Governor Abbott.\n\nThe full discussion with Governor Greg Abbott can be seen Sunday night on FOX 7 News as part of the \"Texas, The Issue Is\" segment.", "source": {"uri": "fox7austin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 7 Austin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudy_koski@fox7austin.com", "name": "Rudy Koski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Abbott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Abbott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox7austin.com/www.fox7austin.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1280/720/snapshot-2024-08-08T170816.503.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802987", "eventUri": "eng-9802987", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-31", "textStart": 1010, "textEnd": 1019}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223760414, "title": "Unusual colour of your stools that could be a sign of silent killer cancer", "text": "Whether you've consumed something that didn't agree with you or are suffering from a stomach bug, there are numerous reasons why your stool might change - including the possibility of bowel cancer. Health experts have emphasised that one symptom of bowel cancer can be a change in your usual bowel habits or blood in your stool, reports the Mirror. The disease can initially manifest in the large bowel (known as colon cancer) or the rectum (rectal cancer). While it may seem challenging to distinguish between common bowel issues and something more serious, medical professionals have highlighted that a key indicator can be related to the colour of your stool. The Cancer Research UK website advises that if you observe blood in your stool that resembles the colour of tar, it's crucial to seek medical attention immediately. It explains: \"Blood from higher up in the bowel doesn't look bright red. It goes dark red or black and can make your poo look like tar. This type of bleeding can be a sign of cancer higher up the bowel. Or it could be from a bleeding stomach ulcer for example.\" In addition, Dr Porter, who writes a column for The Times, clarified that bleeding is a common \"red flag\". He stated: \"Common red flags include bleeding from your bottom (often not cancer but never normal) and/or an unexplained and prolonged change in bowel habit (more than a few weeks), typically to becoming looser rather than constipated.\" Porter stated: \"Call or email your practice, outlining your symptoms (and any relevant family history of bowel cancer), stating that you are concerned. \"What happens next will depend on practice policy but will often start with a stool test that you can do at home to look for, or confirm, bleeding, as well as some blood tests, all followed by an appointment with the GP to run through your symptoms and results. And this will typically include a physical examination and a finger up your backside.\" Other potential signs of bowel cancer include: A lump that your doctor can feel in your back passage or tummy (abdomen), more commonly on the right side The feeling of needing to strain in your back passage (as if you need to poo) Weight loose Pain in your abdomen or back passage Tiredness or breathlessness Symptoms of bowel obstruction include: Cramping pains in the abdomen Feeling bloated Constipation Being sick", "summary": "Experts have stressed that one of the symptoms of bowel cancer can include a change to your normal bowel habit or blood in your stool.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/unusual-colour-your-stools-could-32897249", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32897278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_ezgif-7-ae68d749ea.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:30:06", "author": "Abbie Meehan,Monica Charsley", "authors": ["Abbie Meehan", "Monica Charsley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.136}

Mike Wall appeared to struggle to speak as he recalled the notification early Sunday that an officer from his department had been killed in the line of duty.\n\n\"Our entire department is hurt, and the family of the officer is hurt,\" he said, his voice breaking as officers flanked him, one with his arm around him supporting him.\n\n\"Because of a senseless act by one individual, we have family members who will miss their father at their nearing wedding. But I can assure you we as a police department will stand up, and we will be there, and we are one family,\" Wall said.\n\nThe lieutenant thanked community members who have helped during this tragic situation.\n\nJust before 6 a.m., the Utah Highway Patrol's Richfield office received a call about a person standing on the back of a semitrailer as it drove north, Spanish Fork police said in a news release.\n\nSpanish Fork Police Lt. Cory Slaymaker did not specify whether the semitrailer was parked or driving with a person on the back of it, nor did he provide other details about that call. About 6:30 a.m., the semitrailer was located by a Santaquin police officer and a UHP trooper, and they initiated a traffic stop.\n\n\"During the traffic stop, the driver of the semi fled and drove northbound a short distance before turning around and driving the wrong way back toward the Santaquin officer as well as the UHP trooper,\" Slaymaker said. The semitruck then hit the Santaquin officer and his vehicle, as well as the trooper's vehicle.\n\nThe Santaquin police officer died at the scene. His name has not yet been released.\n\nThe semitrailer driver ran away, and police believe he then stole multiple vehicles. Residents of multiple cities were asked to shelter in place as officer searched for the suspected driver, 42-year-old Michael Aaron Jayne, who police said was considered possibly \"armed and dangerous.\"\n\nGov. Spencer Cox announced on social media that the man had been captured about 11:40 a.m.\n\nJayne was found in Vernal and crashed after a \"short pursuit,\" and he was then taken into custody, Slaymaker said.\n\nProvo Police Chief Troy Beebe announced a procession in honor of the officer as soon as the investigation concludes about 1 p.m. would travel along I-15 from Santaquin to the medical examiner's office in Provo, and he invited community members to show their respects for the officer along that route.\n\nLt. Gov. Deidre Henderson shared a photo on social media of a line of cars parked along a freeway overpass, and a woman standing in the road holding an American flag.\n\n\"Every overpass in south Utah County looks like this. People lining up to pay their respects to the @SantaquinCity police officer killed in the line of duty this morning, as his ambulance and countless emergency vehicles proceed north on I 15,\" she said.\n\nOfficials urged residents in surrounding communities to remain in their homes until after 11 a.m. while they searched for the man who was considered \"armed and dangerous.\" One Payson resident told KSL he and others had been asked to watch doors of a church meetinghouse where services were underway as police nearby were searching for the driver.\n\nThe Utah Department of Public Safety released an alert late Sunday morning that said police were looking for Jayne, who was described as white with unkempt brown hair, a beard, about 6 feet tall and 220 pounds. The alert said the man was possibly armed with a stolen firearm and driving a stolen extended cab long-bed Ford F-150 truck with a grill.\n\nI-15 was closed in both directions for several hours in south Utah County due to the police response. Southbound I-15 reopened in Santaquin just before 11:30 a.m., but northbound lanes remain closed. \"Expect major delays,\" the Utah Highway Patrol warned. About 1:30 p.m., the semitrailer was towed away as rain while rain fell on the freeway and officials continued to divert cars off northbound I-15. The fallen Santaquin officer's car was towed off the freeway soon after.\n\nThe freeway has since reopened.\n\n\"Devastating news from our law enforcement community this morning. Please keep this officer's family in your prayers. Our hearts are broken and we give our unending gratitude to all those who protect and serve,\" Cox posted earlier on X.\n\n\"We're devastated by the loss of this officer from Santaquin. God bless all our law enforcement heroes this morning. We're praying for the safety of those still working this situation,\" Henderson also posted.\n\nSantaquin Mayor Dan Olsen thanked the community and neighboring police chiefs for their help in the response. He said it is a difficult day for their tight-knit, caring community.\n\n\"I want to assure the community that we have the best; we have incredible people that serve this community,\" he said.\n\nIn 2012, a man who appears to be the same person -- a Michael Aaron Jayne, then 30, who appears similar in photos -- led police on a high-speed chase through Barton County, Kansas, while he was wanted for probation violations, the Great Bend Tribune reported. He had been convicted of assaulting and threatening law enforcement officers in his native Redding, California, and in Oregon, according to the report.\n\nPolice in Kansas warned that Jayne should be considered armed and dangerous, and a stolen pickup truck had been recovered in connection to the search.\n\nThe outlet said that \"Jayne is reported to have been willing to enter into high speed chases and cause accidents to avoid capture, as well as willing to invade homes. He has threatened to take lethal measures to avoid being taken back into custody.\"", "source": {"uri": "eastidahonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "East Idaho News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Bill Hooser, who was killed in the line of duty just a few hours earlier.\n\nThe day which began as a sunny Sunday morning soon turned gray and rainy, with unexpected snowflakes falling in some areas.\n\nThe deadly incident began to unfold about 6:30 a.m., when Hooser responded to the scene near mile marker 244 on northbound I-15, according Spanish Fork Police Lt. Cory Slaymaker, who was asked to speak on behalf of the Santaquin Police Department.\n\nA Utah Highway Patrol trooper also responded to the Santaquin incident, said to involve a man reportedly seen standing on the back of a semi. The two arrived and attempted a traffic stop.\n\n\"The driver of the semi fled and drove northbound a short distance before turning around and driving the wrong way,\" back toward the two officers, Slaymaker said.\n\n\"The semi truck hit the Santaquin officer and also his vehicle, as well as the UHP trooper's vehicle. The Santaquin officer died at the scene after being struck by the semi.\"\n\nThe suspect fled on foot, and reportedly stole another vehicle. Mike Aaron Jayne, 42, was found later in Vernal after he crashed a Ford-150 pickup truck reported stolen shortly after the fatal incident.\n\nSlaymaker shared condolences with the Santaquin Police Department after what he described as a \"very traumatic incident, for not only them but the state of Utah.\"\n\nSantaquin Police Lt. Mike Wall was next up. He struggled to regain composure while choked with emotion.\n\n\"I apologize,\" he said as he supported himself by leaning on the podium.\n\n\"Today, this morning, we got notified that one of our officers had been killed in the line of duty,\" Wall said.\n\nOther uniformed officers stepped forward to put a comforting arm on Wall's shoulder or just to stand nearby. \"And,\" Wall continued, \"our entire department is hurt. And the family of the officer is hurt.\" His voice broke again. \"Because of a senseless act by one individual.\"\n\nWall lowered his face, briefly.\n\n\"We have family members who will miss their father at their nearing wedding. But I can assure you, we as a police department will stand up and we will be there, and we are one family.\"\n\nWall thanked \"the many agencies throughout Utah that have stepped in and supported and helped, and also the support of the community. And we thank them. And we ask that, as a community and a department, we stand up as one.\"\n\nSantaquin Mayor Dan Olson spoke next.\n\n\"This is a difficult day,\" he said. \"A day that tends to rock a community that is very tight knit and caring.\"\n\nFor the past few years, Olson said, \"the police and public safety had been one of our No. 1 priorities. We respect them. We love them. They are an integral part of our city. This is a tough loss for us.\"\n\nOlson praised the police department, and said the loss of an officer would be something the city would struggle with for years to come.\n\n\"And we will do our best supporting each other, loving one another, and loving those men in blue that support us every day. I don't know that I can say anything other than I am so proud of our city, so proud of those that serve, the citizens.

Mike Wall of Santaquin Police Department said that, in addition to the family of the officer, the entire department was hurt by the \"senseless act\" of Michael Aaron Jayne, 41, who was the suspect that was arrested on Sunday.\n\n\"We have family members who will miss their father at their nearing wedding,\" Wall said during a press conference. \"But I can assure you, we as a police department will stand up and we will be there and we are one family.\"\n\nIn Santaquin, a police patrol car has been designated as a temporary memorial, as residents place flowers on and around the car. Across the street from that memorial, at the Santaquin city offices, flags were being flown at half-staff out of respect for the officer.\n\n\"It's just a great loss for the community in general,\" Santaquin resident Tina Miller told ABC4.com. \"That's why we're out here -- rain, snow, whatever it takes to show the family and the community that we all support our men in blue.\"\n\nMiller said the Santaquin community is patient and understanding, and fellow resident Heather Brown said it's a tight-knit community. Brown called the death of the officer devastating.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to you,\" Miller said to the family of the fallen officer. \"As a community, we wrap our arms around you.\"\n\nUtah leaders also addressed the situation, both on social media and in a press conference. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson's statement is as follows:\n\nGov. Spencer Cox posted on social media to say he was praying for the officer's loved ones and others affected by the tragedy. During a press conference later on Sunday, Gov. Cox addressed the family of the fallen officer and thanked law enforcement officers.\n\nDuring his Sunday evening press conference, Gov. Cox said it was a \"tragic day.\"\n\n\"We are fortunate to live in a country and in a state where we have so many dedicated law enforcement officers,\" the governor said. \"Our hearts are broken, and our thoughts, our prayers are with the family and the widow of this hero.\"\n\nGov.

He was charged again in Oct. 2010 for making criminal threats and assault for threatening an officer in the Shasta County Jail.\n\nKansas authorities were attempting to locate Jayne in July 2012 after he violated conditions of his parole.

Bill Hooser, 50.\n\nHooser was raised in Utah and had worked with the Santaquin Police department since 2017. He is survived by his wife of 29 years, two daughters and a new granddaughter, according to a GoFundMe campaign set up to raise money for his relatives.\n\n\"Our entire department is hurt. And the family of the officer is hurt,\" said Lt. Mike Wall, with Santaquin police, at a Sunday news conference. \"Because of a senseless act by one individual, we have family members who will miss their father at their nearing wedding.

Bill Hooser is led into the Office of the Medical Examiner in Taylorsville, Sunday, May 5, 2024.\n\nThe sergeant had been responding with a Utah Highway Patrol trooper at about 6:30 a.m. to a report of someone standing on the back of a semitrailer as it traveled north on Interstate 15 near Santaquin, police said.\n\nWhen Hooser and the trooper tried to stop the semitruck, the driver continued on, traveling farther north a short distance before turning around and heading the wrong way back toward Hooser and the trooper, police said.\n\nThe semitruck struck both Hooser's vehicle and the trooper's vehicle. The trooper was not injured, but Hooser died at the scene. It's unclear if anyone was ever on the back of the semitrailer as originally reported.\n\nAfter impact, the semitruck driver ran away, proceeding to steal several vehicles in Sanpete County before he was taken into custody Sunday in Vernal after a short pursuit, which ended when he crashed the vehicle he was driving, police said. He was hospitalized after his arrest, police said.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune generally does not identify defendants unless they have been formally charged with a crime. Public records indicate the 42-year-old has a lengthy criminal history beginning as early as 2001. In 2009, he was convicted of assault in case where he ran over an Oregon police officer.\n\nAccording to Santaquin police, Hooser joined the agency after serving with the San Juan County Sheriff's Department in New Mexico for about two years.\n\nNamed as Santaquin's city employee of the month in October 2022, Hooser loved \"making a difference in people's lives,\" and at the time, the corporal \"really enjoyed his assignment as an investigator,\" according to a bio posted when he received the award.\n\nHis responsibilities included overseeing the Santaquin Police Department's high school internship program.

My prayers go out to the family,\" said Siddiqui.\n\nThe Utah County Sheriff's Office is planning another procession Monday at 10 a.m. to bring the fallen officer back to Santaquin.\n\n3.9 and 4.4 magnitude earthquakes rattle parts of Box Elder County\n\nSpencer Burt\n\n8:22 PM, May 05, 2024\n\nSuspect caught after officer hit, killed by semi-truck near Santaquin\n\nDarienne DeBrule\n\n8:49 AM, May 05, 2024\n\nCouple finds card skimmer at Salt Lake County grocery store\n\nDarienne DeBrule\n\n9:21 PM, May 04, 2024\n\n18-year-old dies by drowning at Sand Hollow State Park\n\nSpencer Burt\n\n7:33 PM, May 04, 2024", "source": {"uri": "fox13now.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSTU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_tencer@fox13now.com", "name": "Emily Tencer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santaquin,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santaquin, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santaquin, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Herbert_Shinners", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Herbert Shinners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semi-trailer truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernal,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vernal, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vernal, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_Hollow_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand Hollow State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moment magnitude scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_County,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah County, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah County, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_County,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake County, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake County, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provo,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provo, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Provo, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Elder_County,_Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box Elder County, Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Box Elder County, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bd07456/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx-default-stgec.uplynk.com%2Fause%2Fslices%2Fbdb%2Fef205c0e5ea14d77944cbd6904335118%2Fbdb4a2fdaaad48ad97129811124db6eb%2Fposter_2ca0f1273a0f44ada5bfc80653a0ee41.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541281", "eventUri": "eng-9541281", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santaquin, Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1735, "textEnd": 1741, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2004-05-", "textStart": 1949, "textEnd": 1955, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

There, he was originally charged with the attempted murder of an Oregon State Police Trooper after he tried to ram two cruisers. Jayne was eventually convicted to serve a \"lengthy prison sentence,\" according to reporting from the Record Searchlight in his native California.\n\nA year later, Jayne was the subject of 17 criminal counts in California for assault upon a correctional officer and making criminal threats. Record Searchlight reported at that time that Jayne had threatened officers on \"several occasions\" while incarcerated in Shasta County, Calif.\n\nJayne made headlines again in 2012 in Barton County, Kan. after he allegedly fled from a traffic stop in a stolen vehicle. According to the Great Bend Tribune, the Barton County Sheriff's Department described Jayne as a fugitive who was \"armed and dangerous.\"\n\nThe Barton County Sheriff's Office reportedly told news outlets that Jayne has been \"willing to enter into high-speed chases and cause accidents\" to avoid capture. Authorities reportedly ended their manhunt for Jayne in July 2012, according to the Associated Press. By October 2012, Jayne was in Texas facing federal charges for possession of a firearm by a felon, court documents show.\n\nCourt documents show he was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison and was released in 2021. Jayne did not reappear again until the incident in Utah this past weekend where he allegedly hit and killed a Santaquin police officer with a semi-truck. Jayne then reportedly stole multiple cars until he was taken into custody in Vernal.", "source": {"uri": "abc4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC 4"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derick_fox@abc4.com",

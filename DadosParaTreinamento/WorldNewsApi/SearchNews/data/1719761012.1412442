Chief Constable Nick Adderley, of Northamptonshire Police, is accused of exaggerating his rank, length of service and Royal Navy achievements. Chris Hayward, who has been with the MoD for nearly 30 years and in the medal office for 15 years, stated that he has inspected \"hundreds if not thousands\" of South Atlantic Medals (SAMs). These medals were awarded to British military personnel and civilians for their service in the Falklands conflict. Hayward revealed that, in his professional opinion, a SAM sent to him by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) was not genuine. This medal was allegedly handed over voluntarily by Adderley at the end of his IOPC interview in October 2023. Adderley has claimed that the medal, which he has been seen wearing several times since at least 2010, was given to him by his brother when he emigrated. He is currently undergoing a three-day misconduct hearing where he faces accusations of exaggerating his naval rank and service length. Notably, he implied involvement in the Falklands War, despite being only 15 years old when the conflict began in 1982. On the first day of the hearing, it was revealed that Adderley falsely claimed to have served in the Royal Navy for a decade, when he had only served two years. He also asserted that he had attended the prestigious Britannia Royal Naval College, despite his application being rejected, and claimed to have been a military negotiator in Haiti, a country he never visited. During the second day of the hearing at Northampton Saints Stadium, Hayward testified about the suspect medal. He stated that the medal was of \"poorer quality\" compared to official South Atlantic Medals (SAMs). \u201cAs soon as I picked it up, I could tell. It was lighter and not made of the same material,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could tell it was not cupronickel and the mount didn\u2019t swivel \u2013 a real one can swivel around. \u201cCopy medals look more blingy, more shiny \u2013 you can tell straight away. We are handling official medals all the time. Hayward explained that copy medals often appear more \"blingy\" and shiny. \u201cCopy medals look more blingy, more shiny \u2013 you can tell straight away. We are handling official medals all the time. \u201cAn inability to swivel is something I have seen before on copies. They don\u2019t swivel, I think because of intellectual property rights \u2013 MoD medals are made by our contractor so they have to be made in a specific way.\u201d The expert also cast doubt on the authenticity of a medal under scrutiny, stating that the inscription on it differed from those on Ministry of Defence (MoD) medals. \"It was totally different, a completely different look and font,\" he said. During questioning by John Beggs KC, representing the Office of the Northamptonshire Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, Hayward was asked if he believed the medal was genuine. \"It was a copy medal, I\u2019m 110% sure,\" he affirmed. Hayward also mentioned that the medal, which arrived without a covering note, was discarded after examination. \"They are not worth any money,\" he explained. He noted that such copies can be purchased from reputable medal dealers but are not made to the same specifications as MoD medals. Neil Collins, the lead investigator at the IOPC, testified that the medal was handed over by Adderley at the end of his interview. It was sent to the MoD in a police evidence bag, which might have led the MoD to believe it originated from Wakefield Police. \"It was sent directly from our Wakefield office and was stowed in what would appear to be an evidence bag,\" Collins said. \"I can surmise it is because it had \u2018Wakefield\u2019 on the bag and it was a police evidence bag.\" Matthew Holdcroft, defending Adderley, questioned whether the medal received by the MoD was the same one sent by the IOPC. He pointed out discrepancies, including the absence of a covering note and conflicting statements about a service number on the medal.

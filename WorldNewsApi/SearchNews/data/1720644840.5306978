{"id": 231288704, "title": "UCD students\u2019 pro-Palestine encampment ends after month as students and university reach agreement", "text": "The encampment, which started on May 11 was organised by a Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) group established by UCD students last autumn, which said it had between 200\u2013250 members. It formed on the main lake at the south Dublin campus by UCD Students\u2019 Union (UCDSU) and the BDS group over the university\u2019s stance on Palestine and was inspired by a similar Trinity College protest. \u201cUCD Students\u2019 Union, UCD BDS and UCD Academics for Palestine have now ended their encampment and associated protests on the Belfield campus,\u201d UCD said in a statement today. UCD said it has a \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to human rights and the rule of law and is outraged by the killing of civilians, the withholding of humanitarian aid and the destruction in Palestine by Israel. \u201cAs a member of the global university community with an enduring commitment to academic freedom, expression and safety, UCD is particularly appalled by the destruction of all universities in Gaza and attacks on their students, faculty and staff,\u201d the university said. They said their statement follows the Irish government\u2019s recognition of the state of Palestine and their intervention in South Africa\u2019s case against Israel in the International Court of Justice. \u201cThe university recognises the International Court of Justice rulings to prevent the violation of international laws in Palestine. \u201cUCD supports freedom of speech and the right of students and staff to protest on campus. We recognise the powerful tradition of student and staff activism in our university, as in others, in bringing about positive change,\u201d the statement adds. Protesters at UCD had issued a list of demands they wanted UCD to address, including calls for the university to end all academic ties with Israel; to disclose all academic and financial links with Israeli institutions and enterprises, and to commit to divest from any investments in the country. They also asked UCD to remove Israeli goods and supplier contracts from campus. As a result of the protests, UCD said today it will establish a separate stream of up to eight sanctuary scholarships for displaced Palestinian applicants as part of its University of Sanctuary programme. In addition, under the existing scholars at risk programme, UCD said it will support up to four scholars from Palestinian universities. To enhance oversight by its governance structures, a working group, including nominees of the UCD Students\u2019 Union, will be established to develop a policy on ethical investment by June 2025 for approval by Governing Authority. The bursar will report annually to the finance, remuneration and asset management committee of the governing authority on the location of all university investments. The list of research grants included in enhanced President\u2019s reports to the governing authority will include the international partners for each. Nominees determined by the students union will join a review group of its sustainable procurement policy. UCD said it remains committed to sustaining an inclusive university culture, respecting a diversity of views, and sense of belonging for all. The university added that it \u201cwill take action to ensure our multicultural campus community can be better reflected in the names of spaces on our campus, and in university awards and honours\u201d.", "summary": "<p>A pro-Palestinian encampment at UCD protesting the university\u2019s ties to Israel has come to an end after a month, following an agreement reached between students and the academic institution.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/ucd-students-pro-palestine-encampment-ends-after-month-as-students-and-university-reach-agreement/a558127904.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/Tz3H665b7oDRFZFTDY1ZSdLU5NE=/0x0:6000x4000/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/e5d35d44-35a6-4059-b5f6-dec3a5e741f6/d0665beb-2628-46e5-94d7-0e374d8cd8f5/e5d35d44-35a6-4059-b5f6-dec3a5e741f6.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:37:57", "author": "Cian \u00d3 Broin", "authors": ["Cian \u00d3 Broin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.263}

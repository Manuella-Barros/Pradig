Here's Why.", "text": "Choosing to go hair-free on areas like your legs, arms and pubic area is your prerogative, but when it comes to the hairs living inside your nose, they\u2019re better left untouched. \u201cThe nose is a delicate area with numerous blood vessels and mucous membranes,\u201d said Dr. Don J. Beasley, an Idaho-based board-certified otolaryngologist (also known as an ear, nose and throat specialist). Whether you\u2019re DIYing it or getting serviced at a salon, yanking out your nose hairs \u2014 especially if it\u2019s done improperly or without proper hygiene practices in place \u2014 may increase the risk of infection, leading to complications such as folliculitis or nasal cellulitis. Below, we spoke with experts to learn the risks of nose hair waxing and tweezing, as well as the safer alternatives. The Importance Of Nose Hairs You may not have given your nose hairs a second thought (aside from how unpleasant they may be), but the fact is, they\u2019re there for a reason. \u201cThe primary role of nose hairs is to trap dust, pollen and other airborne particles in the air so that the air you breathe is partially filtered,\u201d said Dr. Michael Jacobs, a New York-based board-certified dermatologist and associate professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. He explained that the hairs act as a physical barrier, preventing these allergens from entering the nasal passages and potentially causing irritation or harm to the respiratory system. Nose hairs also play a protective role by alerting us to potential dangers, Beasley said. \u201cWhen something touches the nostril hairs, such as a small insect or other irritants, it triggers a reflexive sneeze, which is the body\u2019s way of expelling the intruder or irritant,\u201d he explained. Beyond this, nose hairs help to maintain optimal moisture levels in the nasal passages. \u201cNose hairs trap moisture from exhaled air, preventing the nasal passages from becoming too dry,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cThis moisture helps to humidify the air we breathe, making it more comfortable for our respiratory system.\u201d What Are The Risks Of Nose Hair Waxing? Nose hair waxing can be tempting because it provides longer-lasting results compared to alternative methods like trimming. But completely removing your nose hairs means removing the filtration system that\u2019s essential to keeping you healthy and warding off infections like nasal vestibulitis and nasal abscess, said Dr. Nicole Aaronson, a Delaware-based board-certified otolaryngologist. \u201cWhile waxing doesn\u2019t necessarily weaken the immune system, it does breach the skin barrier by creating openings for bacteria to get into the deeper tissues, thus creating the opportunity for infection,\u201d she said. Nose hair waxing can also come with some side effects, especially if performed in the hands of an untrained person \u2015 or if you do it yourself, for that matter. For one, Aaronson said that wax that\u2019s too hot can burn the nasal mucosa, or the tissue lining the nasal cavity. This removal of the top layer of skin can also create small lesions in the nose and put you at greater risk of infection. Plus, waxing can be an irritating process in general. \u201cNose waxing can be an uncomfortable experience, as the delicate nasal passages can be sensitive to the pulling sensation, potentially causing temporary pain, redness and irritation,\u201d Beasley said. Ingrown hairs may also be an issue with nose hair waxing. \u201cAn ingrown hair occurs after a hair is removed when the new hair that regenerates from the follicle can\u2019t break through the skin,\u201d Aaronson explained. \u201cBecause waxing pulls out the hair by the roots, the hair must find its way out through the outer layer of the skin again (unlike other hair removal methods where the hair is left at the skin\u2019s surface).\u201d So, what about partial nose hair waxing (that is, removing only the hair located at the front part of the nose)? Aaronson said to avoid this practice, as it \u201ccarries all of the same risks of nasal vestibulitis, ingrown hairs and burning.\u201d Ultimately, Jacobs warned against nose hair waxing altogether to avoid the risk of inhaling more toxins and particles, irritating the nasal membranes and creating ingrown hairs. Alternatives To Nose Hair Waxing Waxing and partial waxing are already off the table, and you can also add tweezing to the list. Aaronson said to avoid plucking out your nose hairs, noting that she has had to perform incision and drainage of nasal abscesses related to plucking of nasal hairs. \u201cI would not recommend this method of hair removal for the nose,\u201d she said. If you find that your nose hairs are reaching lengthy, unsightly heights, you can try carefully trimming them with a clean pair of eyebrow scissors, which are effective for removing straggling hairs that are visibly sitting underneath the nostril. If you\u2019re concerned with hurting yourself during this process, opt for angled scissors with rounded tips, as they reduce the risk of accidental nicks and cuts and are strategically shaped to get to those hard-to-reach areas. For trimming hairs deeper inside the nose, opt for an electric trimmer \u2014 these are both safe and easy to use, and require minimal effort on your part. These two methods of nose hair trimming \u2014 rounded scissors and electric trimmers \u2014 are much safer alternatives to waxing and help prevent the risk of ingrown hairs and irritation.This article originally appeared in HuffPost.", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/never-ever-tweeze-wax-nose-111602805.html", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H8xE95Bz3Rx0XUG56zMOaQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTc-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/buzzfeed_articles_778/52626f9f526c260dd08dc01a1c759845", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:03:33", "author": "Buzzfeed", "authors": ["Buzzfeed"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.029}

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian, and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nREAD: Fears of Middle East war grow after Hamas leader's killing\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza through US, Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the Associated Press, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a US-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nIn Washington, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sinwar \"has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the ceasefire.\"\n\nHe said Sinwar must \"decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire ... It really is on him.\"\n\nREAD: Israeli strike kills 3 sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.", "source":

Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nThe two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics ... The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newindianexpress.com", "name":

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area. The Palestinian territory faces a severe humanitarian crisis as its Health Ministry says the death toll in the war approaches 40,000.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nIsrael confirms the death of the only person who was still missing from the Oct. 7 attack\n\nThe Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it had confirmed the death of the only person still considered missing from the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe army said it had officially informed the family of Bilha Ynon that she was not alive, after a committee of health experts, IDF and police officials and Israel's chief rabbi had determined that she was murdered on Oct. 7. The conclusion followed \"an extensive investigative effort\" and testing of new evidence found in the area of Ynon's home in the community of Netiv Ha'asara, the army said.\n\nThe Hamas border attack that triggered the ongoing Gaza war killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage, 110 of which are still held in Gaza. Over a third of the hostages in captivity are believed to be dead.\n\nIsraeli says it remains committed to killing Hamas' new political leader\n\nJERUSALEM -- The Israeli military's chief spokesperson said Israel remains committed to killing Yahya Sinwar, in response to news about his election as leader of Hamas' political bureau.\n\n\"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists,\" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in an interview with Saudi news channel Al-Arabiya.\n\nIsrael said it killed Deif, the head of Hamas' military wing, in a huge strike in southern Gaza last month. Hamas has not confirmed Deif's death.\n\nSinwar, who is Hamas' chief in Gaza, is considered along with Deif to be the chief architect of the deadly Oct. 7, on southern Israel, the act that sparked the Israel-Hamas.\n\nSince then, Israel has repeatedly vowed to kill him.\n\n\"Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history -- October 7th,\" Hagari said during the interview with Al-Arabiya.\n\nHamas' new leader is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nBiden and Egypt's El-Sisi speak about 'final stage' of negotiations\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli airstike on house in central Gaza kills 3, injures 20 others\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nEgypt working with China to reduce tensions in the Middle East\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nPalestinians in Gaza still struggling to get food and clean water\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah vows to retaliate against Israel for Beirut airstrike\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nAt least 19 hurt in northern Israel after Hezbollah launches drone strikes\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nUltra-Orthodox protesters enter Israeli military base, objecting to draft order\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nHezbollah launches drone attack in northern Israel, wounding at least 7\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nThe only humanitarian air corridor into southern Gaza is shut down\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nAn Israeli strike on a village in south Lebanon kills 4, Health Ministry says\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nAn Israeli officer is stabbed on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police say\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\n10 Palestinians are killed and 10 wounded in Israeli raids in the West Bank\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nAustralia's prime minister condemns Iranian ambassador's comments on social media as 'abhorrent'\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.

Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.", "source": {"uri": "vinnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "vinnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_feldman@vinnews.com", "name": "Joseph Feldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://vinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24219658683535-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 139, "textEnd": 145, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hamas names Oct 7

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sinwar \"has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the cease-fire.\"\n\nHe said Sinwar must \"decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire ... It really is on him.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n--

Hamas named its Gaza leader Sinwar as successor to former political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week, the group said today, in a move that reinforces the radical path pursued since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nCAIRO >> Hamas named its Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar as successor to former political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week, the group said today, in a move that reinforces the radical path pursued since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nSinwar, the architect of the most devastating attack on Israel in decades, has been in hiding in Gaza, defying Israeli attempts to kill him since the start of the war.\n\n\"The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement, succeeding the martyr Commander Ismail Haniyeh, may Allah have mercy on him,\" the movement said in a brief statement.\n\nNews of the appointment, which came as Israel braces for a response to the killing of Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, was greeted with a salvo of rockets from Gaza from the bands of militants still fighting Israeli troops in the besieged enclave.\n\n\"The appointment means that Israel needs to face Sinwar over a solution to Gaza war,\" said a regional diplomat familiar with the talks brokered by Egypt and Qatar, which are aimed at bringing a halt to the fighting in Gaza and a return of 115 Israeli and foreign hostages still held in the enclave.\n\n\"It is a message of toughness and it is uncompromising.\"\n\nSinwar, who spent half his adult life in Israeli prisons, was the most powerful Hamas leader left alive following the assassination of Haniyeh, which has left the region on the brink of a wider regional conflict after Iran vowed harsh retaliation.\n\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the assassination but it has said it killed other senior leaders, including Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri, who was killed in Beirut, and Mohammed Deif, the movement's military commander.\n\nBorn in a refugee camp in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Sinwar, 61, was elected as Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017 after gaining a reputation as a ruthless enforcer among Palestinians and an implacable enemy of Israel.\n\nIsrael's chief military spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, blamed Sinwar for the Oct 7 attack and said Israel would continue to pursue him.\n\n\"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the Oct 7th terrorists,\" he told Al-Arabiya television, according to a statement released by the military. \"That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nUNITY\n\nIn a sign that the movement had united around the choice of Sinwar, Khaled Meshaal, a former leader who had been seen as a potential successor to Haniyeh, was said by senior sources in the movement to have backed Sinwar \"in loyalty to Gaza and its people, who are waging the battle of the Flood of Al-Aqsa\".\n\nFor Israel, the appointment confirms Hamas as a foe dedicated to its destruction and is likely to reinforce Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence that Israel must pursue its campaign in Gaza to the end.\n\nTen months since the surprise attack by thousands of Hamas-led fighters who swarmed into Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 7, the war has turned the Middle East on its head and threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict.\n\nSome 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and more than 250 taken hostage into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP Photo/Adel Hana, File)BEIRUT (AP) - Hamas on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader in a dramatic sign of the power of the Palestinian militant group's hardline wing after his predecessor was killed in a presumed Israeli strike in Iran. The selection of Sinwar, a secretive figure close to Iran who worked for years to build up Hamas' military strength, was a defiant signal that the group is prepared to keep fighting after 10 months of destruction from Israel's campaign in Gaza and after the assassination of Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh. His selection is likely to provoke Israel, which has put him at the top of its kill list after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages. The announcement comes at volatile moment. Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' death. Hamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death. In reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\u009d The two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza - particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades - has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy. Haniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators - though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar. Speaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations. \"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\"\u009d he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal. But he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\u009d Mediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms - a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Hamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release. Speaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\u009d As Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities. In one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\"\u009d He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets He has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes. Hugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\"\u009d he said. The killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\"\u009d he said. - - AP correspondents Kareem Chehayeb and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP's war coverage at", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' death.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nThe two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza - particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades - has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators - though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms - a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bassem_mroue@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Bassem Mroue",

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' death.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nThe two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n-- --", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh",

Sinwar is believed to be hiding deep inside the expansive tunnel system under the Gaza Strip since he is the top target for the Israeli military.\n\nSinwar and the head of Hamas's military wing, Mohammed Deif, are said to be the masterminds behind the October 7 attack on southern Israel. Israel claims it killed Deif in a recent airstrike on a tent camp in Gaza, which killed at least 90 Palestinians, but his death hasn't been confirmed by Hamas.\n\nHamas officials said the decision to appoint Sinwar as the head of the political bureau was made unanimously. \"The Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement, succeeding the martyr Commander Ismail Haniyeh, may Allah have mercy on him,\" Hamas said in a statement.\n\nThe Israeli killing of Haniyeh suspended the indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas. In the weeks leading up to the assassination, it was widely acknowledged by Israeli officials that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was doing everything he could to sabotage the chances of a hostage and ceasefire deal.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 797, "textEnd": 806}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nThe two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics ... The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n-- --\n\nAP correspondents Kareem Chehayeb and Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week.

Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ...

Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.In reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm.

That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"Video below: U.S. increases military presence in Middle East as Israel-Hamas War escalatesThe two assassinations left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in Hamas. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.Haniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.Speaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.

Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.He has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.Hugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said Israel's killing of multiple senior Hamas figures over the past months cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.The killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\nHamas on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader in a dramatic sign of the power of the Palestinian militant group's hardline wing after his predecessor was killed in a presumed Israeli strike in Iran.\n\nThe selection of Sinwar, a secretive figure close to Iran who worked for years to build up Hamas' military strength, was a defiant signal that the group is prepared to keep fighting after 10 months of destruction from Israel's campaign in Gaza.\n\nHis selection is likely to provoke Israel, which has put him at the top of its kill list after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in a blast Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel.

Hamas on Tuesday named Sinwar, who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader - a dramatic sign of the power of the Palestinian militant group's hardline wing. Adel Hana/Associated Press, file\n\nBEIRUT -- Hamas on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader in a dramatic sign of the power of the Palestinian militant group's hardline wing after his predecessor was killed in a presumed Israeli strike in Iran.\n\nThe selection of Sinwar, a secretive figure close to Iran who worked for years to build up Hamas' military strength, was a defiant signal that the group is prepared to keep fighting after 10 months of destruction from Israel's campaign in Gaza and after the assassination of Sinwar's predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIt is also likely to provoke Israel, which has put him at the top of its kill list after the Oct. 7 attack, in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nThe announcement comes at volatile moment. Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh's killing.\n\nRelated U.S., allies prepare to defend Israel as Netanyahu says 'multifront war' with Iran already underway\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the Oct. 7 terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza - particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades - has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators - though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nRelated Israel kills militants in West Bank as a nervous region watches latest on cease-fire talks\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms - a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nRelated Mourners bury Hamas chief in Qatar as more escalation looms over Middle East\n\nIn Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sinwar \"has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the cease-fire.\"\n\nHe said Sinwar must \"decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire ... It really is on him.\"\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\nCopy the

In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at a press briefing that she had no comment on the announcement of Sinwar's appointment.\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n-- --\n\nAP

But a person familiar with Washington's thinking said the selection suggested that Hamas could toughen its position in cease-fire negotiations and make it harder to reach a deal.\n\nThey added, however, that Israel was already aware that even before his formal appointment Sinwar would have the final word on any agreement to halt the fighting, and the announcement merely set the seal on that.\n\nTen months since the surprise attack by thousands of Hamas-led fighters who swarmed into Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 7, the war has turned the Middle East on its head and threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict.\n\nSome 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and more than 250 taken hostage into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a cease-fire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach.\"\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He was the pragmatic face of Hamas and said to be less hardline or militaristic than his successor, Yahya Sinwar.\n\nHamas has named the mastermind behind the 7 October attack, Yahya Sinwar, as its new leader.\n\nThe group's last chief, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran last month in what Hamas called a \"treacherous Zionist raid on his residence\".\n\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nHaniyeh's successor has been chosen as Sinwar, the architect of the attack that saw Hamas militants enter southern Israel, kill 1,200 people and take 250 more hostage.\n\nIn response, Israel's military campaign has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\n\"The Islamic resistance movement Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement, succeeding the martyr Commander Ismail Haniyeh, may Allah have mercy on him,\" Hamas said in a brief statement.\n\nNews of the announcement was met with a salvo of rockets from Gaza from militants still fighting in the besieged enclave.\n\nIt comes as Israel continues to brace for a response over the killing of Haniyeh.\n\n\"The appointment means that Israel needs to face Sinwar over a solution to Gaza war,\" said a regional diplomat familiar with the talks brokered by Egypt and Qatar, which are aimed at bringing a halt to the fighting in Gaza and a return of 115 Israeli and foreign hostages still held in the enclave.\n\n\"It is a message of toughness and it is uncompromising,\" they added.\n\nRead more:\n\nUNWRA staff fired over possible involvement in 7 Oct attack\n\nFamilies of UK embassy staff withdrawn from Lebanon\n\nEyewitness: Inside the one place left for Gazans to go\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanon-based, Iran-aligned group, congratulated Sinwar on his ascendancy, saying it \"confirms goals that the enemy [Israel] seeks from killing leaders and officials failed in achieving its outcome\".\n\nSinwar has spent half his life in Israeli prisons and was Hamas's most powerful leader left alive following the assassination of Haniyeh.\n\nHe has been hiding in Gaza, evading ongoing Israeli attempts to kill him.\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh has also left the region bubbling on the edge of wider-war as Israel said it killed other senior Hamas leaders including deputy leader Saleh al Arouri, who was killed in Beirut, and Mohammed Deif, the movement's military commander.\n\nIsrael's military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Sinwar was responsible for the 7 October attacks and vowed they would continue to hunt him.\n\n\"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the 7 October terrorists,\" he told Al-Arabiya television, according to a statement released by the military.\n\n\"That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him,\" he added.\n\nHamas seemingly united around the choice of Sinwar as Khaled Meshaal, a former leader who was seen as one of Haniyeh's potential successors, was said to have backed the Gaza-based chief.\n\nAccording to senior sources, Meshaal backed Sinwar \"in loyalty to Gaza and its people\".\n\nSinwar, 61, was born in a refugee camp in Khan Younis and studied Arabic at the Islamic University of Gaza, which was founded in 1978 by the two men who went on to set up Hamas.\n\nWhile there, he became close to cleric Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, who co-founded Hamas in 1987 as a Gaza-based political splinter group of the Muslim brotherhood.\n\nIn 2017, Sinwar was elected as Hamas's leader within Gaza after gaining a reputation as a ruthless enforcer.\n\nHe is suspected of killing fellow Palestinians thought to have collaborated with Israel.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at a press briefing that she had no comment on the announcement of Sinwar's appointment.\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n-- --\n\nAP

According to a statement from Hamas, Yahya Sinwar has become the new leader.\n\nHamas Political Bureau Chairman Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran, has been replaced by Yahya Sinwar.\n\nAfter the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the capital of Iran, Tehran, Hamas elected a new leader. In a statement by Hamas, it was reported that the new leader is Yahya Sinwar.\n\nYahya Sinwar came to the forefront as the de facto leader of Hamas after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh. Born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip in 1962, Yahya Sinwar played an important role in shaping the organization as one of the founding members of Hamas. Sinwar, who joined Hamas in the late 1980s, quickly took over the leadership of the organization's security wing. Sinwar, who was accused of killing two Israeli soldiers and organizing assassinations against Palestinian informants in 1989, was sentenced to life imprisonment four times. Sinwar, who spent 22 years in Israeli prisons, was released in 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit exchange.\n\nThe years in prison strengthened Sinwar's ideology and hostility towards Israel. According to former Israeli intelligence official Michael Koubi, Sinwar boasted of killing Palestinian informants during interrogations. This process strengthened his tough and uncompromising image within Hamas. Sinwar, who was elected as the leader of Hamas in Gaza in 2017, served as a bridge between the organization's military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and its political wing. This position made him one of the most influential figures in Hamas. Unlike Haniyeh, Sinwar has operational experience in the field. This allows him to have more influence over the organization's military wing.\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Mahmoud Pezeshkian. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced in a statement on July 31 that an attack was carried out on Haniyeh's residence in Tehran. Iran and the Hamas Movement held Israel responsible for the cowardly assassination.\n\nBorn in a refugee camp in Gaza in 1962, Ismail Haniyeh was an important figure since the establishment of Hamas. Haniyeh, who was imprisoned by Israel several times, survived an assassination attempt by Israel in 2003. After Hamas won the elections three years later, Haniyeh briefly served as the Prime Minister of Palestine. In 2017, he was elected as the head of Hamas' political bureau. Haniyeh led the Hamas delegation in negotiations mediated by Qatar, the United States, and Egypt.", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_State_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the State of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://foto.haberler.com/haber/2024/08/06/hamas-in-yeni-lideri-yahya-sinvar-oldu-17694596_6468_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2023, "textEnd": 2030}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Daniel Hagari, an IDF spokesman, said in a televised statement in February.\n\nBorn in a Gaza refugee camp in the early 1960s, Sinwar joined Hamas after it was founded in 1987, gaining a reputation for brutality after he reportedly helped to form the militant group's internal security force, according a profile of him by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank.\n\nIn 1988 he was sentenced to life in prison for planning to kill two Israeli soldiers as well as the killing of four Palestinians he suspected of collaborating with Israel. He was released in 2011 as one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier held by Hamas for more than five years.\n\nAfter his release, Sinwar rose quickly through the ranks of Hamas and was elected to become the group's leader in a secret ballot in 2017. On taking over, Sinwar attempted to improve relations with Egypt and Fatah, the secular Palestinian political party that partially runs the occupied West Bank and rivals Hamas in Gaza, according to the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSinwar has been in hiding since Oct. 7, when Hamas militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking around 240 hostage, according to Israeli tallies.

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Al-Arabiya television, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza through US, Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the ceasefire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_fedayeen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian fedayeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Arabiya", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Arabiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Hamdan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osama Hamdan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://static.srpcdigital.com/styles/1200x600/public/2024-08/740586_0.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 83, "textEnd": 89, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

But a person familiar with Washington's thinking said the selection suggested that Hamas could toughen its position in ceasefire negotiations and make it harder to reach a deal.\n\nThey added, however, that Israel was already aware that even before his formal appointment Sinwar would have the final word on any agreement to halt the fighting, and the announcement merely set the seal on that.\n\nTen months since the surprise attack by thousands of Hamas-led fighters who swarmed into Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip in the early hours of the morning of Oct. 7, the war has turned the Middle East on its head and threatened to spiral into a wider regional conflict.\n\nSome 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and more than 250 taken hostage into Gaza. In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.

He is the group's chief decision-maker in Gaza, and is believed to hold control over the estimated 120 Israeli hostages who are still in Hamas's custody.\n\nRelated: Yahya Sinwar: the man who may hold key to release of Gaza hostages\n\nSinwar succeeds Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas political chief who was killed in a bombing attack last week that Hamas and Iranian officials blamed on Israel. The assassination came during the inauguration of Iran's new president and has further stirred fears of a larger regional war involving Iran, which backs Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Iran has promised to retaliate against Israel for the attack on its soil.\n\nHaniyeh was another key figure in the talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire, and was seen as an intermediary between Israel and Sinwar. Haniyeh had little direct control over Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip and was seen as a relative moderate, directing Hamas's delegations in talks mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the US aimed at a ceasefire and hostage and prisoner release deal.\n\nSinwar is a founding member of Hamas and is seen as the group's most powerful figure. A former head of the group's intelligence service, Sinwar spent 23 years in Israeli prisons as he served four life sentences for attempted murder and sabotage. A former interrogator called him \"1,000% committed and 1,000% violent, a very, very hard man\".\n\nSinwar was released as part of a swap in which Israel traded 1,000 prisoners in 2011 in exchange for Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier who had been captured five years earlier by Hamas. Sinwar quickly returned to militancy and said that he had concluded that capturing Israeli soldiers was the key to freeing prisoners from Israel.\n\nThe move will further consolidate the group under Sinwar, whose elevation to the head of Hamas's political wing will raise further doubts about the potential for any ceasefire deal to be struck in the conflict. Sinwar is believed to have launched the 7 October attack from Gaza without informing the political leadership, which was headquartered under Haniyeh in Qatar.\n\n\"In electing Sinwar to head Hamas, the organisation lays to rest any differences between external and internal leaders and whatever illusions of moderation existed to reveal its true face,\" wrote Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.\n\nIsrael claims it killed Hamas's military commander, Mohammed Deif, in a strike in July, among a number of assassinations of key members of Hamas's leadership. Another top political leader, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in January.\n\nThe policy of killing top Hamas leaders, including those from the more moderate political wing, has led to rising tensions between the US president, Joe Biden, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden last week told Netanyahu during a phone call that the Israeli PM was intentionally sabotaging efforts to conclude a ceasefire, according to the New York Times and other US media. Netanyahu argued that the assassination in Teheran would temporarily delay negotiations, but would ultimately lead to a ceasefire more quickly by putting pressure on Hamas.\n\nRelated: Assassination again shows Netanyahu's disregard for US-Israel relations\n\nIn reaction to Sinwar's appointment, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion: \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas's spokesperson Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the ceasefire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the US for the failure to seal a deal.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType":

In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yomna Ehab and Jaidaa Taha in Cairo, Ali Sawafta

U.S. officials believe Sinwar could be surrounded by hostages, who are being used as human shields. The U.S. State Department designated Sinwar as a global terrorist in 2015. He has also been sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.\n\nSinwar, who has reportedly spent half of his adult life in Israeli prisons, is reported to have directed Hamas' war strategy with Israel over the last 10 months, and is believed to be involved in talks with Israel for a cease-fire and hostage-prisoner exchange.\n\nHaniyeh was assassinated Wednesday in Tehran, where he was scheduled to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's new president. Haniyeh was killed by a missile launched from another country.\n\nWhile Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh's assassination, it has claimed responsibility for the strike last month that killed Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif and last week's strike that killed Fouad Shukr, Hezbollah senior military commander and founding member of the Iran-backed group.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel prepared for the possibility of attack by Iran in the wake of the assassinations, as Hamas leaders convened a council to discuss the militia's future and its new leader.\n\n\"The assassination of the mujahid brother Ismail Haniyeh will only increase the strength of the Hamas movement and the Palestinian resistance to continue its path and approach,\" the militia said. \"His pure blood will ignite the fire of resistance and escalate it.\"\n\nFollowing Tuesday's announcement of Sinwar as Hamas' new leader, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari issued a statement to the Saudi network Al Arabiya.\n\n\"There's only one place we are designating for Yahya Sinwar, and that's right next to Mohammed Deif and all the other terrorists who are responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks,\" said Hagari.

The choice of Hamas to name him leader of the movement now puts Gaza front and centre of, not just the events on the ground, but certainly of the dynamics in the Hamas movement,\" Nour Odeh, a Palestinian political analyst based in Ramallah, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"And it really sends a signal, as far as negotiations of a ceasefire is concerned, that Gaza calls the shots.\"\n\nHezbollah welcomed Sinwar's appointment late on Tuesday, calling it a strong message to Israel and the United States, and showing that Hamas is united in its decision-making.\n\n\"Selecting the brother Yahya Sinwar from the heart of the besieged Gaza Strip - who is present the frontlines with resistance fighters and between the children of his people, under the rubble, blockade, killings and starvation - reasserts that the goals the enemy is seeking by killing leaders have failed,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nSinwar was born in a Gaza refugee camp, south of Khan Younis, and was the former head of the Al-Majd security apparatus, tasked with eliminating Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. He became the leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip in 2017.\n\nSinwar is one of several Hamas leaders for whom the International Criminal Court (ICC) sought an arrest warrant over allegations of war crimes committed on October 7.\n\nWarrants were also sought for some Israeli leaders, including Netanyahu and Israeli defence chief Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes in Gaza.\n\nBut despite Israel's promise to wipe out Hamas, and a military campaign that ranks among the most destructive in modern history, the Palestinian armed group has continued to hold out against Israeli forces in Gaza.\n\nSinwar has likewise managed to evade capture by Israel, despite a proclamation by Gallant that Sinwar was living \"on borrowed time\" after October 7.\n\n\"I think the focus on Gaza, and the focus on Sinwar, is a major signal of defiance,\" Al Jazeera senior political analyst Marwan Bishara said.\n\n\"And of the fact that Hamas is not about to lose Gaza, that Hamas is going to remain a power within Gaza, and hence its leader is there.\"", "source": {"uri": "247ureports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The 247 Ureports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh's killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at a press briefing that she had no comment on the announcement of Sinwar's appointment.\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hard-line direction,\" he said.", "source":

He is seen by Israel as the mastermind behind behind the Oct. 7 invasion, during which Hamas-led terrorists launched a massacre in Israeli territory, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage.\n\nBorn in a refugee camp in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Sinwar joined Hamas in the late 1980s, raising to prominence as the founder of the group's intelligence arm, known as the Majd.\n\nIn 1989, Sinwar was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences for abducting and murdering two Israeli soldiers. He remained in an Israeli prison until 2021, when Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by Hamas and held in Gaza for five years.\n\nSince his release from prison, Sinwar has participated in numerous attacks against Israel, including the so-called 11-Day War in May 2021, during which Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist group fired rockets at Israel and drew retaliatory Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. Department of State designated Sinwar a global terrorist. The designation means that it is illegal for American citizens to provide him with any financial or material help, and that any assets he may have in the United States must be frozen.\n\nSinwar is believed to have been hiding out in Gaza, where Hamas spent more than a decade building an extensive labyrinth of tunnels.\n\n\"The hunt for Sinwar will not stop until we catch him, dead or alive,\" Israeli Defense Force spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a press conference upon releasing the footage, noting that the video was taken from a surveillance camera inside the tunnel, where soldiers have been pursuing Sinwar since they surrounded his home in December.\n\nThe death of Haniyeh -- which Hamas has blamed on Israel, but Israel hasn't taken credit for -- makes Sinwar the most powerful Hamas figure. With Hamas's remaining fighting force under his direct control, Sinwar is now in a position to accept or reject any ceasefire or hostage release deal with Israel.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/06/id5700933-GettyImages-1243644178-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 145, "textEnd": 151}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 708, "textEnd": 714}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

He is the group's chief decision-maker in Gaza, and is believed to hold control over the estimated 120 Israeli hostages who are still in Hamas' custody.\n\nSinwar succeeds Ismail Haniyeh, the former Hamas political chief who was killed in a bombing attack last week that both Hamas and Iranian officials blamed on Israel. The assassination came during the inauguration of Iran's new president and has further stirred fears of a larger regional war involving Iran, which backs both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Iran has promised to retaliate against Israel for the attack on its soil.\n\nHaniyeh was another key figure in the talks between Israel and Hamas over a ceasefire, and was seen as an intermediary between Israel and Sinwar.

While the Iranian government and Hamas say that Israel carried out the assassination, Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\nIn response to Sinwar's selection, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told the Saudi network Al Arabiya, \"There's only one place we are designating for Yahya Sinwar, and that's right next to Mohammed Deif and all the other terrorists who are responsible for October 7 [attacks]. It's the only place we are preparing and designating for him.\"\n\nIsrael said last week that Hamas' military chief Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month - a report Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nTwo of Hamas' principal allies - Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - have welcomed Sinwar's new role. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, said the choice of Sinwar \"confirms that the objectives sought by the enemy through the assassinations of leaders and officials have failed to achieve their goals.\"\n\n'Not good news regarding the deal'\n\nBecoming Hamas' political leader consolidates Sinwar's power within the movement, but could also cast uncertainty on next steps for ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Israel.\n\nBasem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau told CNN late Tuesday that the selection of Sinwar to replace Haniyeh means, \"you [Israel] chose to assassinate those who negotiate, and we chose those who can oblige you to sign the agreement,\" he said.\n\nAnd one man who spent many years in Israeli prisons with Sinwar, Esmat Mansour told CNN that his new role spells trouble for any future deal.\n\n\"As far as Israel is concerned, this is not good news regarding the deal, because it has considered the military wing and Sinwar to be the hardliners,\" he said. \"It's Sinwar who holds the captives. Now all decisions are within his authority, the military as well as the political decisions, and the decision [whether to hold] negotiations.\"\n\nHe added that Sinwar's close relationship with Iran could mean other negotiating parties, like Qatar and Turkey, which have good relations with the United States, may \"lose their ability to influence the deal, or at least weaken their ability to influence.\"\n\nAnalysts say that while Sinwar's viewpoint has always been critically influential in the negotiations, his difficulty in communicating with the outside world means that the details of negotiating with mediators from Qatar and Egypt have fallen to other Hamas officials, led by Haniyeh until his assassination last week.\n\n\"Even though Sinwar was not physically at the negotiating table with the mediators, he has been consulted at every critical juncture in the negotiations,\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond said Tuesday.\n\n\"That often contributed to delays in the negotiations, with it sometimes taking days for messages to reach him and for his response to be received by Hamas officials in Qatar or Cairo.\"\n\n'Returned the decision-making to Gaza'\n\nA longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas' military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group's civilian and political leader.\n\nHe was elected to Hamas' main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch.

While the Iranian government and Hamas say that Israel carried out the assassination, Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\nIn response to Sinwar's selection, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told the Saudi network Al Arabiya, \"There's only one place we are designating for Yahya Sinwar, and that's right next to Mohammed Deif and all the other terrorists who are responsible for October 7 [attacks]. It's the only place we are preparing and designating for him.\"\n\nIsrael said last week that Hamas' military chief Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month - a report Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nTwo of Hamas' principal allies - Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - have welcomed Sinwar's new role. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group, said the choice of Sinwar \"confirms that the objectives sought by the enemy through the assassinations of leaders and officials have failed to achieve their goals.\"\n\n'Not good news regarding the deal'\n\nBecoming Hamas' political leader consolidates Sinwar's power within the movement, but could also cast uncertainty on next steps for ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Israel.\n\nBasem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau told CNN late Tuesday that the selection of Sinwar to replace Haniyeh means, \"you [Israel] chose to assassinate those who negotiate, and we chose those who can oblige you to sign the agreement,\" he said.\n\nAnd one man who spent many years in Israeli prisons with Sinwar, Esmat Mansour told CNN that his new role spells trouble for any future deal.\n\n\"As far as Israel is concerned, this is not good news regarding the deal, because it has considered the military wing and Sinwar to be the hardliners,\" he said. \"It's Sinwar who holds the captives. Now all decisions are within his authority, the military as well as the political decisions, and the decision [whether to hold] negotiations.\"\n\nHe added that Sinwar's close relationship with Iran could mean other negotiating parties, like Qatar and Turkey, which have good relations with the United States, may \"lose their ability to influence the deal, or at least weaken their ability to influence.\"\n\nAnalysts say that while Sinwar's viewpoint has always been critically influential in the negotiations, his difficulty in communicating with the outside world means that the details of negotiating with mediators from Qatar and Egypt have fallen to other Hamas officials, led by Haniyeh until his assassination last week.\n\n\"Even though Sinwar was not physically at the negotiating table with the mediators, he has been consulted at every critical juncture in the negotiations,\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond said Tuesday.\n\n\"That often contributed to delays in the negotiations, with it sometimes taking days for messages to reach him and for his response to be received by Hamas officials in Qatar or Cairo.\"\n\n'Returned the decision-making to Gaza'\n\nA longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas' military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group's civilian and political leader.\n\nHe was elected to Hamas' main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo's de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).\n\nHe has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.\n\nMansour told CNN that \"Sinwar is a unifying name, there is consensus on that name internally for Hamas...They need a unified movement.

(The Times of Israel: Mohammed Abed/AFP)\n\n(THE TIMES OF ISRAEL) The Hamas terror group on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar as the new head of its \"political bureau,\" the highest-ranking position in the organisation, following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last week.\n\nThe leader of Hamas in Gaza since 2017, Sinwar is widely considered the architect of the October 7, 2023, invasion and massacre in southern Israel, in which thousands of Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostage, sparking the ongoing war in Gaza. It is believed that 111 of the hostages abducted on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of 39 confirmed dead by the IDF. Hamas avowedly seeks to destroy Israel.\n\nSinwar was selected by Hamas's 50-strong Shura Council, a consultative body composed of officials elected by Hamas members in four chapters: Gaza, the West Bank, the diaspora and security prisoners in Israeli jails.\n\nIsraeli officials believe that Sinwar has been forced to hunker down in Hamas's vast network of tunnels beneath Gaza since the slaughter he planned and orchestrated 10 months ago. They have indicated he is likely in tunnels under Khan Younis or Rafah, possibly surrounded by hostages.\n\nIn February, the IDF published a video, filmed on October 10, said to show Sinwar walking through a Gaza tunnel with several of his family members.\n\n\"The hunt for Sinwar will not stop until we catch him, dead or alive,\" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagaeri said in a press conference upon releasing the footage.\n\nAsked about the Hamas announcement in an interview with the Saudi-based Al Arabiya news channel on Tuesday, Hagari said, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar and that is next to Muhammad Deif and all the terrorists who are responsible for October 7. This is the only place we are preparing and designating for him.\"\n\nThe IDF confirmed on August 1 that it had killed Deif, the commander of Hamas's military wing, in an airstrike in southern Gaza last month. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nForeign Minister Israel Katz echoed Hagari's comments, releasing a statement that said Hamas's decision was \"yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organization off the face of the earth.\"\n\nA senior Hamas official told AFP after the announcement that the selection of Sinwar as Hamas's political bureau chief sends a \"strong message\" to Israel. The choice is \"a strong message to the occupation (Israel) that Hamas continues its path of resistance,\" the official said.\n\nSinwar \"is now the most powerful figure in Hamas, formally too,\" Palestinian affairs analyst Ohad Hemo noted on Channel 12 news on Tuesday evening. \"That was already essentially the case, now it's official.\"\n\n\"It's a show of faith\" by the terror group, \"whose leadership is rapidly shrinking,\" Hemo added, \"and it returns the formal center of Hamas power to Gaza,\" whereas in recent years much of the official leadership was overseas -- including Haniyeh and Khaled Mashaal, both based in Qatar.\n\n\"This is happening precisely when Hamas is in its worst shape ever in Gaza,\" said Hemo, as the IDF works to destroy its military and governance capabilities. \"It's a highly significant move\" by Hamas, \"an expression of faith in the man who has been leading it in Gaza and, if I may so, into the abyss.\"\n\nSinwar was convicted in 1989 of leading the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers, as well as four Palestinians he suspected of cooperating with Israel. He was given four life sentences but was released after 22 years as part of the deal to return captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.\n\nSinwar is said to speak fluent Hebrew as a result of his time in Israeli prisons. He received life-saving brain surgery while he was a prisoner, as recounted by the dentist who identified the tumor in a New York Times article in May.\n\nSinwar succeeded Haniyeh as Hamas's Gaza leader in 2017.\n\nBoth Hamas and Iran have blamed Israel for the explosion in a Tehran guesthouse that killed Haniyeh early last Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has vowed to retaliate for his killing. Israel has not commented on Haniyeh's death.\n\nAn unsourced report in the Jewish Chronicle published Tuesday claimed that the bomb that killed Haniyeh was planted hours before he was assassinated by two Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps agents recruited by the Mossad and not weeks or months in advance as previously reported. According to the report, the device was placed under Haniyeh's bed and detonated remotely by a robot.", "source": {"uri": "australianjewishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza.

In a statement delivered to the Agence France-Presse news agency, an unnamed Hamas official said that the choice of Sinwar to replace Ismail Haniyeh -- the Hamas leader assassinated in Tehran on July 31 -- sent \"a strong message to the occupation (Israel) that Hamas continues its path of resistance.\" Separately, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan told the Qatari-owned channel Al-Jazeera that Sinwar \"is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reacted to the announcement by pledging that Sinwar would share the same fate as Muhammad Deif, the senior Hamas military commander who was killed in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis on July 13. \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Muhammad Deif and the rest of the October 7 terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him,\" Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya broadcaster.\n\n\"Hamas's leadership has been eviscerated by Israel over the last nine months. Only a few recognizable names remain. Yahya Sinwar, the man who launched the war in the Middle East on October 7, has now emerged as the single leader atop Hamas. However, Sinwar is living in a Gaza tunnel on borrowed time. When the Israelis catch up to him, serious questions remain about the future of Hamas. Chaos looms, and it bodes poorly for the future of this Iran-backed terrorist group.\" -- Jonathan Schanzer, FDD Senior Vice-President for Research\n\n\"One bloodthirsty Iran-backed Jew-hater with American blood on his hands replaces another. His fate will be the same. Hamas increasingly looks like an organization on its last legs -- perhaps Sinwar's legs.\" -- Richard Goldberg, FDD Senior Advisor\n\n\"Sinwar checked many boxes that Hamas considers essential when selecting a new leader. He spent years in an Israeli prison for murder, rose through the ranks of Hamas, and orchestrated the October 7 attack. However, this choice may ultimately represent a significant miscalculation. For Hamas to survive, it requires stability at the top, and appointing a leader who is currently hiding in Gaza while being pursued by the IDF may not have been in the best interest of the group.\" -- Joe Truzman, Senior Research Analyst at FDD's Long War Journal\n\nSince the October 7 onslaught 10 months ago, Sinwar has been in hiding in Gaza. A video released by the IDF in February showed an apparently healthy Sinwar strolling through an underground tunnel in Gaza accompanied by several family members -- the first time he had been spotted since the massacre in Israel.\n\nIn an interview with Israel's Channel 12, Palestinian affairs analyst Ohad Hemo said the appointment of Sinwar had formalized his status as \"the most powerful figure\" inside Hamas. Calling it a \"show of faith\" by a terrorist organization \"whose leadership is rapidly sinking,\" Hemo noted that the selection of Sinwar by Hamas's 50-man Shura Council -- a consultative body with members in Gaza, the West Bank, abroad, and among Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails -- had returned \"the formal center of Hamas power to Gaza,\" given that many of its top leadership have been based abroad, including Haniyeh and Khaled Mashal, a founding member of the Hamas politburo. On August 4, the Saudi-owned news channel Alhadath reported that Sinwar had conveyed a message opposing Mashal's appointment as Haniyeh's successor to a meeting in Qatar on the grounds that he wanted someone with closer ties to the Iranian leadership to take the helm.\n\nThe 61-year-old Sinwar is a veteran Hamas terrorist who was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences by an Israeli court in 1988 for the kidnapping and murder of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. However, he was released in 2011 as a part of a deal that involved exchanging more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for the captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Classified as a \"Specially Designated Terrorist\" by the United States in 2015, Sinwar became the leader of Hamas in Gaza in 2017. Michael Koubi, an Israeli interrogator who questioned Sinwar on several occasions, recalled that Sinwar was totally devoted to the terrorist organization. \"He told me Hamas is my wife, Hamas is my child. Hamas for me is everything,\" Koubi said. Yuval Bitton, a former senior Israel Prison Service official who also encountered Sinwar, recalled that the terrorist leader had been successfully treated by doctors in Israel for a brain tumor. \"We saved his life, and this is his thanks,\" Bitton said, referring to the October 7 atrocities.\n\nIn a speech in Gaza in December 2022, Sinwar hinted at the assault that would unfold the following October, telling the crowd, \"We will come to you, God willing, in a roaring flood. We will come to you with endless rockets, we will come to you in a limitless flood of soldiers, we will come to you with millions of our people, like the repeating tide.\" More than 1,200 people were killed and over 250 kidnapped on October 7 amid atrocities that included mass rape, decapitation, and the mutilation of the dead. The attack marked the bloodiest act of terror in Israel's history as well as the worst single day of violence targeting Jews since the Nazi Holocaust.", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType":

He is widely considered the mastermind of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack that saw the massacre of at least 1,200 Israeli civilians, with about 250 taken hostage.\n\n\"The choice of Hamas to name him leader of the movement now puts Gaza front and center of, not just the events on the ground, but certainly of the dynamics in the Hamas movement,\" Nour Odeh, a Palestinian political analyst based in Ramallah, told Al Jazeera. \"And it really sends a signal, as far as negotiations of a cease-fire is concerned, that Gaza calls the shots.\"\n\nSinwar has been in hiding as Israel has conducted its military operation in Gaza, with a goal of eradicating Hamas and rescuing the remaining hostages.\n\nThe IDF in February published a video, filmed Oct. 10, said to show Sinwar walking through a Gaza tunnel with several of his family members, The Times of Israel reported.\n\n\"The hunt for Sinwar will not stop until we catch him, dead or alive,\" IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said after release of the footage.\n\nSinwar is one of three Hamas officials for whom the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant because of war crimes committed Oct. 7. The other two, Haniyeh and Mohammad Deif, Hamas' military chief, are dead. Israel Defense Forces confirmed Aug. 1, a day after Haniyeh's death, that Deif died last month in a Gaza strike.\n\n\"This is happening precisely when Hamas is in its worst shape ever in Gaza,\" Palestinian affairs analyst Ohad Hemo told The Times of Israel, as the IDF works to destroy the group's military and governance capabilities. \"It's a highly significant move\" by Hamas, \"an expression of faith in the man who has been leading it in Gaza and, if I may so, into the abyss.\"\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience

Reports had previously indicated that the terrorist organization was considering the appointment of a relatively unknown successor, at least temporarily.\n\nHaniyeh was viewed by some in Jerusalem as an obstacle to a hostages-for-terrorists ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel.\n\nSinwar, 61, is widely believed to have masterminded the Oct. 7 assault, in which Hamas terrorists murdered some 1,200 people and wounded thousands while raping, torturing, burning and mutilating their victims. Terrorists also took more than 250 hostages back to Gaza.\n\n'A cold disregard for human life'\n\nOn Oct. 14, Israel Defense Forces Spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht told journalists that Sinwar and his command team \"are in our sights.\"\n\n\"Yahya Sinwar is the face of evil. He is the mastermind behind this, like [Osama] bin Laden was. He built his career on murdering Palestinians when he understood they were collaborators. That's how he became known as the butcher of Khan Yunis [in southern Gaza],\" said Hecht.\n\nSinwar was convicted on multiple murder counts by an Israeli court and sentenced to five life sentences, which he was supposed to serve until his death. However, in October 2011, he was released from prison -- having served 22 years -- as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange.\n\nFollowing his release, Sinwar gained power and popularity within Hamas, becoming its Gaza leader in 2017 by defeating Haniyeh in a vote. Sinwar is now believed to be hiding in the tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip, surrounded by Israeli hostages used as human shields.\n\nAccording to U.S. military intelligence, Sinwar has been facing internal calls for Hamas to lay down its arms because it is being blamed for the growing suffering in Gaza after ten months of fighting the IDF.\n\nHowever, the terror leader, who enjoys good relations with Iran, has reportedly pushed Hamas to take a hardline stance in hostage talks.\n\nIn February, during a push for a truce deal, Sinwar sent a message to Hamas officials telling them to avoid concessions and continue to push unrealistic demands as mounting \"high civilian casualties\" would place global pressure on Israel, The Wall Street Journal reported in June.\n\n\"We have the Israelis right where we want them,\" he said in a note sent to officials looking to close a deal via Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nThe Journal reviewed \"dozens of messages\" sent by Sinwar in which \"he's shown a cold disregard for human life and made clear he believes Israel has more to lose from the war than Hamas,\" the newspaper said.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType":

So, by choosing him as the head of its political bureau, Hamas is sending a message of defiance to the Israeli government.\n\nBut it remains unclear how Sinwar will be able to communicate with fellow Hamas operatives, run the day-to-day political operations of the movement, and oversee Gaza ceasefire negotiations while in hiding.\n\nIsraeli officials have made no secret of their desire to kill him.\n\nBorn in 1962 in Khan Younis, Sinwar is often portrayed as one of the most uncompromising top Hamas officials. He was arrested by Israel repeatedly in the early 1980s for his involvement in anti-occupation activism at the Islamic University in Gaza.\n\nAfter his graduation, he helped establish a network of fighters to take up armed resistance against Israel. The group would later become the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.\n\nSinwar joined Hamas as one of its leaders almost as soon as the group was founded by Shaikh Ahmad Yasin in 1987. The following year, he was arrested by the Israeli forces and handed four life sentences - the equivalent of 426 in jail - for alleged involvement in the capture and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four suspected Palestinian spies.\n\nHe spent 23 years in Israeli jail where he learned Hebrew and became well versed in Israeli affairs and domestic politics. He was freed in 2011 as part of the prisoner exchange deal that saw the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by Hamas.\n\nAfter his release, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas's ranks again. In 2012, he was elected to the group's political bureau and was tasked with coordinating with the Qassam Brigades.\n\nHe played a leading political and military role during Israel's seven-week offensive against Gaza in 2014. The next year, the United States labelled Sinwar as a \"specially designated global terrorist\".\n\nIn 2017, Sinwar became Hamas's chief in Gaza, succeeding Haniyeh, who was elected as the chair of the group's political bureau.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had travelled regionally and delivered speeches throughout the continuing war on Gaza, until his assassination, Sinwar has been tight-lipped since October 7.\n\nBut in a 2021 interview with Vice News, Sinwar said that while Palestinians do not seek war due to its high cost, they will not \"wave the white flag\".\n\n\"For long periods, we tried peaceful and popular resistance. We expected that the world, free people and international organisations would stand by our people and stop occupation from committing crimes and massacring our people. Unfortunately, the world stood by and watched,\" he said.\n\nSinwar was likely describing the Great March of Return, during which Palestinians protested every week for months on end at the Gaza border in 2018 and 2019, but met a violent Israeli crackdown that killed more than 220 people and injured many more.\n\nAsked about Hamas's tactics, including firing indiscriminate rockets that could harm civilians, Sinwar said Palestinians are fighting with the means at their disposal. He accused Israel of deliberately killing Palestinian civilians en masse, despite having advanced, precise weaponry.\n\n\"Does the world expect us to be well-behaved victims while we are being killed, for us to be slaughtered without making a noise?\" Sinwar had said.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_University_of_Gaza", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic University of Gaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\u20132019_Gaza_border_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2018\u20132019 Gaza border protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-08-06T183431Z_881737084_RC2HA9A1ARP0_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-SINWAR-1722970928.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 556, "textEnd": 563}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 602, "textEnd": 611, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Fears are high of an escalation into a wider regional war, with Iran vowing revenge against Israel over Haniyeh's killing and Lebanon's Hezbollah threatening to retaliate over Israel's killing of one of its top commanders in an airstrike in Beirut last week. American, Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to salvage negotiations over a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza, shaken by Haniyeh' killing.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Haniyeh, who was killed in a blast that Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not confirmed or denied responsibility. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn reaction to the appointment, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya televsion, \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nIsrael's killings of multiple senior officials in Hamas over recent months left Sinwar as the most prominent figure in the group. His selection signals that the leadership on the ground in Gaza -- particularly the armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades -- has taken over from the leadership in exile, which has traditionally maintained the position of the overall leadership to navigate relations with foreign allies and diplomacy.\n\nHaniyeh, who had lived in self-imposed exile in Qatar since 2019, had played a direct role in negotiations over a cease-fire in Gaza through U.S., Qatari and Egyptian negotiators -- though he and other Hamas officials always ran proposals and positions by Sinwar.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSpeaking to Al-Jazeera television after the announcement, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan said Sinwar would continue the cease-fire negotiations.\n\n\"The problem in negotiations is not the change in Hamas,\" he said, blaming Israel and its ally the United States for the failure to seal a deal.\n\nBut he said said Sinwar's selection was a sign the group's will had not been broken. Hamas \"remains steadfast in the battlefield and in politics,\" he said. \"The person leading today is the one who led the fighting for more than 305 days and is still steadfast in the field.\"\n\nHamas' allies Iran and Hezbollah issued statements praising Sinwar's appointment.\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to the AP, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMediators have been struggling to push through a U.S.-backed outline for a deal, but talks have hit obstacles, particularly over its centerpiece terms -- a release of all of Hamas' remaining hostages in return for an end to the war and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nHamas has demanded guarantees from mediators that an initial cease-fire will continue until terms for that exchange are worked out. Israeli leaders have threatened to resume fighting to eliminate Hamas after an initial partial hostage release.\n\nSpeaking Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, \"Escalation is not in anyone's interest, it will only only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity, ... It is also critical that we break this cycle by reaching a cease-fire in Gaza. That, in turn, will unlock possibilities for more enduring calm, not only in Gaza itself but in other areas where the conflict could spread.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday at a press briefing that she had no comment on the announcement of Sinwar's appointment.\n\nAs Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, Sinwar rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule over the territory. Close to Deif and Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn one of his few appearances, Sinwar ended a public speech in Gaza by inviting Israel to assassinate him, proclaiming, \"I will walk back home after this meeting.\" He then did so, shaking hands and taking selfies with people in the streets.\n\nHe has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, which triggered Israel's campaign of bombardment and offensives aimed at destroying Hamas. The death toll among Palestinians is now nearing 40,000, most of the population of 2.3 million has been driven from their homes, and large swaths of Gaza's towns and cities have been destroyed. In May, prosecutors at the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes over the Oct. 7 attack, as well as against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister for war crimes.\n\nHugh Lovatt, an expert on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the European Council on Foreign Relations. said the elimination of other top figures cleared the way for Sinwar. \"Two weeks ago, few would have expected Sinwar to be the group's next leader despite the strong influence he exerts from Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, a relative moderate, \"not only opened the path for Sinwar to claim full control of Hamas, but also appears to have tipped the group into a more hardline direction,\" he said.\n\n-- --\n\nAP

About 250 people were also seized as hostages.\n\n\"Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history,\" said Israel's military spokesperson Daniel Hagari on Tuesday. \"There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif [a Hamas leader Israel said it has killed] and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nDiplomats in the region had expected Haniyeh to be replaced by another member of the political leadership in Qatar, where he had been living in exile. His killing was considered a setback for the diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, as he was the main interlocutor dealing with Qatari and Egyptian mediators.\n\nSinwar's appointment as political leader could risk hardening both Netanyahu's and Hamas's stance in the negotiations.\n\nA diplomat briefed on the talks said: \"Ultimately you always had to convince Sinwar to buy into the deal. But you've lost a voice in Haniyeh, who could do that. Others can help but of course do not have the same weight as Haniyeh.\"\n\nThe US and its allies view the talks as vital to ending the war and defusing soaring regional tensions.\n\nShortly before Hamas announced Sinwar would take over as political leader, US President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar as Washington continued to press for a hostage and ceasefire deal.\n\nOn separate calls with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, Qatar's emir, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Biden addressed \"their efforts to de-escalate regional tensions\", and the three leaders \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible\", the White House said.\n\nBorn in a slum in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza, Sinwar rose to prominence in the 1980s as an adviser to Hamas's wheelchair-bound founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.\n\nSinwar helped build Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades, and was later tasked with leading its feared internal security apparatus, which hunted down suspected Palestinian collaborators, earning him the nickname \"the butcher of Khan Younis\".\n\nHe spent more than 22 years in an Israeli prison for his role in eliminating collaborators, and was released as part of a 2011 prisoner exchange in which more than 1,000 Palestinians were released for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was held by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThose who have spent time with Sinwar have described him as a charismatic man of few words, a quick temper and a commanding presence.\n\nIn the days following the October 7 attacks, he was seen in the tunnel network under Gaza, according to some of the freed hostages. Israeli intelligence believes Sinwar has avoided capture or assassination in south Gaza by remaining inside Hamas's vast underground tunnel network.\n\nEarlier this year, the Israeli military released a video it claimed was of Sinwar, accompanied by his family, moving through one such tunnel underneath Khan Younis.\n\nHis killing has been one of the key objectives of the Israeli campaign to \"destroy\" Hamas in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type":

Sinwar, accused by Israel of orchestrating the deadly October 7 attack, is one of Israel's most wanted militants.\n\nAfter a career in the shadows, spent in Israeli prisons and the internal security apparatus of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar has emerged as leader of the Palestinian group in the middle of a full-blown war.\n\nSinwar, who until now was the movement's Gaza chief, replaces Ismail Haniyeh, whose killing in Tehran last week sent tensions soaring across the Middle East and raised fears of a coordinated attack on Israel by Iran and its regional proxies.\n\nWatch moreIran says has 'legal right' to punish Israel for Haniyeh killing in Tehran\n\nBy choosing him as the group's chief Hamas \"is sending a strong message to the occupation that Hamas continues its path of resistance\", a senior Hamas official told AFP.\n\nSinwar stands accused of masterminding the group's October 7 attacks, the worst in Israel's history, which left 1,198 dead and 251 taken hostage according to an AFP tally and Israeli official figures.\n\nIn the aftermath of that attack, the Israeli military insisted he was a \"dead man walking\", although Sinwar has not been seen since.\n\nThe October 7 attack was probably a year or two in the planning, \"took everyone by surprise\" and \"changed the balance of power on the ground\", said Leila Seurat of the Arab Centre for Research and Political Studies (CAREP) in Paris.\n\nThe ascetic 61-year-old is a security operator \"par excellence\", according to Abu Abdallah, a Hamas member who spent years alongside him in Israeli jails.\n\n\"He makes decisions in the utmost calm, but is intractable when it comes to defending the interests of Hamas,\" Abu Abdallah told AFP in 2017, after his former co-detainee was elected Hamas's leader in Gaza.\n\nPunishing collaborators\n\nAfter October 7, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht called Sinwar the \"face of evil\" and declared him a \"dead man walking\".\n\nBorn in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in southern Gaza, Sinwar joined Hamas when Sheikh Ahmad Yassin founded the group around the time the first Palestinian intifada began in 1987.\n\nSinwar set up the group's internal security apparatus the following year and went on to head an intelligence unit dedicated to flushing out and mercilessly punishing -- sometimes killing -- Palestinians accused of providing information to Israel.\n\nAccording to a transcript of an interrogation with security officials published in Israeli media, Sinwar professed to have strangled an alleged collaborator with a keffiyeh scarf in a Khan Yunis cemetery.\n\nA graduate of the Islamic University in Gaza, he learned perfect Hebrew during his 23 years in Israeli jails and is said to have a deep understanding of Israeli culture and society.\n\nHe was serving four life terms for the killing of two Israeli soldiers when he became the most senior of 1,027 Palestinians released in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.\n\nSinwar later became a senior commander in the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, before taking overall leadership of the movement in Gaza.\n\nWhile his predecessor, Haniyeh, had encouraged efforts by Hamas to present a moderate face to the world, Sinwar has preferred to force the Palestinian issue to the fore by more violent means.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's withering aerial and ground assault launched in response to the October 7 attacks has killed at least 39,653 people in the Palestinian territory.\n\nWatch moreUS working 'around the clock' to avert escalation in the Middle East\n\nAccording to US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, he has vowed to punish anyone obstructing reconciliation with Fatah, the rival political movement with which Hamas engaged in factional fighting after elections in 2006.\n\nThat coming together remains elusive, but the prisoner releases resulting from the brief November truce agreement with Israel have seen Hamas's popularity soar in the West Bank.\n\nSinwar has pursued a path of being \"radical in military planning and pragmatic in politics\", according to Seurat.\n\n\"He doesn't advocate force for force's sake, but to bring about negotiations\" with Israel, she said.\n\nThe Hamas chief was added to the US list of the most wanted \"international terrorists\" in 2015.\n\nSecurity sources outside Gaza say that Sinwar has taken refuge in the network of tunnels built under the territory to withstand Israeli bombs.\n\nVowing in November to \"find and eliminate\" Sinwar, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant urged Gazans to turn Sinwar in, adding \"if you reach him before us, it will shorten the war\".", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

Yahya Sinwar as top...", "body": "Hamas tapped Gaza chief and Oct. 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar as its new leader on Monday to succeed the terror group's previous head, who was assassinated in Tehran.\n\nSinwar, who has managed to evade the Israeli military's campaign for nearly 10 months, was officially named the new Politburo chief following the death of Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a bombing in Tehran last week.\n\nIt remains unclear when Sinwar will officially take over and just how in control he will be -- he remains in hiding while leading Hamas' forces in war-torn Gaza, with few clues as to where he might be.\n\nSinwar has been named as the chief architect of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel that left more than 1,200 people dead and some 250 others kidnapped.\n\nThe last known footage of Sinwar was taken on Oct. 10 as he ran through a Hamas tunnel with his family.\n\nWhile several Hamas commanders and even Hamas head military chief, Mohammed Deif, have been killed by the Israeli military, there remains no hints as to where Sinwar is hiding out.\n\nExperts believe he remains in Gaza, deep inside the 300-mile-long tunnel system, making his rise to power notable as many of Hamas' previous political leaders have served in exile from the Palestinian enclave.\n\nColin Clarke, a counter-terrorism expert at the New York-based Soufan Group, previously told The Post that Sinwar has survived so far by staying radio-silent and using Israeli hostages and innocent Palestinians as human shields to protect him.\n\nClarke suggested Sinwar has lived as long as he has despite Israel's hunt for him by staying out of the limelight, a technique that may no longer be viable if he's expected to lead Hamas' entire organization.\n\nAs the head of the Politburo, Sinwar will be in charge of coordinating among the terror group's leadership not just in Gaza, but also the West Bank, the diaspora and those in Israeli prisons.\n\nHis rise to power also spells trouble for the already stalled cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, as Sinwar has repeatedly gotten in the way of compromises and urged the terror group to keep fighting.\n\nBefore being Hamas' top official in Gaza, a young Sinwar was known as \"The Butcher of Khan Younis\" for his relentless and brutal slaughter of suspected informants for Israel within the terror group's ranks.\n\nSinwar, who was born in a Khan Younis refugee camp, was eventually arrested in 1988 and convicted of killing two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.\n\nDespite the life sentence, Sinwar only spent 23 years in jail and was released in 2011 as one of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners freed in exchange for captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nHamas announced Sinwar's rise to the top of its leadership following reports that Mohamed Ismail Darwish, the man leading Hamas' Shura Council, would serve as its interim leader until the group can hold elections next year.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronny_reyes@nypost.com", "name": "Ronny Reyes", "type":

Please try again later.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Yehiya Sinwar, 61, the elusive leader of Hamas in Gaza and the chief architect of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, will replace Ismail Haniyeh as head of the militant group's political bureau, Hamas announced Tuesday.\n\nSinwar is an ideological hard-liner who spent more than two decades in Israeli jails and is thought to have eluded Israeli forces by hiding in the vast tunnel network underneath Gaza. His ascension to the top political position solidifies his role as the paramount leader of Hamas -- and underscores how its Gaza-based faction has consolidated control of the movement after Oct. 7.\n\nHaniyeh, who was based in Qatar and seen as a more moderate face of the movement, was killed Wednesday while visiting Tehran in an attack Hamas blamed on Israel. Israel has not commented on the attack, but informed U.S. officials immediately afterward that it was responsible.\n\nIt remains unclear how Sinwar, in hiding and atop Israel's most-wanted list, will carry out Haniyeh's diplomatic duties, including serving as a chief negotiator in cease-fire talks, which have stalled again in the aftermath of the assassination. During months of on-again, off-again negotiations, Haniyeh has shuttled between Arab capitals, but it was Sinwar who had the final word on any agreement.\n\n\"There is only one place for Yehiya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the Oct. 7 terrorists,\" Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told Al Arabiya TV shortly after Monday's announcement. Deif, the head of Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, was killed in an Israeli attack last month, according to the IDF. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nIn a statement, Hamas expressed confidence in Sinwar \"as its leader at this sensitive stage,\" while praising Haniyeh for his \"wise and open leadership.\"\n\nHaniyeh and Sinwar represented Hamas's two intertwined strands -- a Palestinian nationalist political party, and a militant Islamist movement dedicated to Israel's destruction. Both men grew up in Gaza's impoverished refugee camps, set up to house Palestinians displaced and dispossessed during the founding of Israel in 1948. And both were accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for their role in Oct. 7.\n\nIsrael vowed to eradicate Hamas as a military and governing force in Gaza after the attacks by Hamas-led fighters, who killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 253 others hostage. Israel's retaliatory war on Gaza has leveled much of the enclave and killed nearly 40,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of dead are women and children.\n\nHaniyeh was close to Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin, who was assassinated by Israel in 2004. Haniyeh rose through Hamas's ranks and was appointed to the top political role in 2017. Shortly after, he left Gaza and later set up a diplomatic base in Doha, the Qatari capital.\n\nSinwar, in contrast, helped establish Hamas's military wing and spent more than 20 years in Israeli jails, where he learned Hebrew and burnished his reputation among fellow militants. In 2017, he was chosen to replace Haniyeh as the head of Hamas in Gaza, blurring the lines between the group's political and military wings.\n\nOver the years, Haniyeh built relations with Hamas's internal rival, the Fatah party that heads the Palestinian Authority, based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. While Sinwar is seen as a more divisive figure, Palestinian officials in Ramallah expressed support for him Monday.\n\n\"The decision to choose Yehiya Sinwar is a logical and expected response to the assassination of the martyr Ismail Haniyeh,\" Jibril Rajoub, a prominent Fatah figure, told the Iran-aligned Al-Mayadeen TV channel Monday. \"Sinwar is a pragmatic figure, a realistic and logical man.\"\n\nHaniyeh's predecessor, Khaled Meshaal, was seen as a leading contender to return to the role, at least temporarily. But his poor relations with Iran, Hamas's top financial backer, were thought to have worked against him.\n\nIn Sinwar, Hamas has chosen \"the option of extremism closest to Iran,\" according to Ahmed Awad, head of the Center for Future Studies at Al-Quds University in Ramallah. It \"means that Gaza will be a decision-maker in the region,\" he said.\n\nHajar Harb in London, Hazel Balousha in Cairo and Sufian Taha in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

(Mahmud HAMS / AFP)\n\nYahya Sinwar, named leader of Hamas on Tuesday, masterminded the bloodiest attack on Jews in a single day since the Holocaust, having made no secret of his desire to strike hard at Israel, the country that imprisoned him for almost half his adult life.\n\nIn December 2022, the militant leader told a rally in Gaza that the Palestinian group Hamas would deploy a \"flood\" of fighters and rockets against Israel, in a speech to supporters that bore the hallmarks of crowd-pleasing hyperbole.\n\n\"We will come to you, God willing, in a roaring flood. We will come to you with endless rockets, we will come to you in a limitless flood of soldiers, we will come to you with millions of our people, like the repeating tide,\" he said in his address.\n\nLess than a year later, Israel discovered it was no idle threat, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's fence on 7 October 2023, staging an assault that killed 1 200 people, took 152 hostage and broke Israel's reputation as an invincible enemy.\n\nA hunter of collaborators\n\nSinwar, 61, who before Tuesday's announcement was the Hamas chief in Gaza, began his career as a ruthless enforcer who punished and killed collaborators with Israel, before rising to a leadership role after his release from prison in 2011 and his return to Gaza.\n\nThe war set off by the 7 October attack laid waste to Gaza, as Israel sought to eliminate Hamas. Sinwar has been at the top of Israel's assassination list during the conflict.\n\nBy the time of the speech, Sinwar and the militant Islamists' military leader Mohammed Deif had already hatched secret plans for the October 2023 assault, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nHamas regarded the attack as a major victory against Israeli occupation. The International Criminal Court called it a war crime. Its prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Sinwar, Deif and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response which reduced much of Gaza to rubble.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nHeard in hindsight, Sinwar's words foreshadowed what was to come, an attack Hamas dubbed the \"flood of Al-Aqsa,\" a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem that is one of Islam's holiest shrines and stands on a place revered by Jews as Temple Mount. Al-Aqsa has been subject to repeated Israeli raids.\n\nSinwar never made a public appearance after the 7 October attacks, but directed military operations along with Deif and another commander. He also led negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps, possibly from bunkers beneath Gaza.\n\nIn the days after the attacks, Sinwar was seen by some of the captured Israelis in the tunnels, freed hostages have said. Hamas and Israeli officials did not publicly comment on the reported sighting.\n\nThe question of hostages and prisoner swaps is deeply personal for Sinwar, who spent 23 years behind bars, and has vowed to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. He was one of 1 027 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in a swap for a single Israeli soldier held in Gaza in 2011.\n\nBorn in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Sinwar was elected as Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017. After 7 October, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he and other leaders were \"living on borrowed time.\"\n\nBefore he was jailed, Sinwar rose to prominence as the head of the Al-Majd security apparatus which tracked and killed Palestinians accused of providing information on Hamas to Israel's secret service.\n\nBoth Hamas leaders and Israeli officials who know Sinwar agree he is devoted to the movement to an extraordinary level.\n\nOne Hamas figure based in Lebanon described him as \"puritanical ... with an amazing ability of endurance.\"\n\nMichael Koubi, a former Shin Bet official who interrogated Sinwar for 180 hours in prison, said he clearly stood out for his ability to intimidate and command. Koubi once asked the militant, then aged 28 or 29, why he was not already married.\n\n\"He told me Hamas is my wife, Hamas is my child. Hamas for me is everything.\"\n\nSinwar was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to consecutive life terms accused of planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians.\n\nIn jail, his hard line against collaborators continued, Israelis who dealt with him have said.\n\nAt times, \"he did not have Jewish blood on his hands, he had Palestinian blood on his hands,\" Yuval Bitton, previously head of the Israel Prison Service's intelligence division, told Channel 12 TV in October.\n\nBitton, a dentist who treated Sinwar, said Israeli medics removed a tumour in Sinwar's brain in 2004. \"We saved his life and this is his thanks,\" said Bitton, referring to Oct. 7. Bitton's nephew was killed during the attack and his body taken to Gaza by the militants.\n\nKoubi described Sinwar as being devoted to the destruction of Israel and to killing Jews. The senior Israeli official described him as a \"psychopath\", adding that \"I don't think the way he grasps reality is similar to more rational and pragmatic terrorists\".\n\nBitton added that the Hamas leader was willing to allow huge suffering for a cause and had once in prison led 1 600 prisoners to the brink of a mass hunger strike until death if needed in protest at the treatment of two men in isolation.\n\n\"He was ready to pay any price for the principle,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "news24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His promotion came following the death of Ismail Haniyeh. Haniyeh was killed in an alleged bombing in Tehran, while a top Hezbollah commander was also killed in Beirut last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nThe killings have raised fears of a wider conflict that could see Israel fighting on multiple fronts.\n\nIran has vowed to retaliate. Israel has accused Sinwar of masterminding the deadly Oct. 7 attack. Israeli officials believe he has taken refuge in the terror group's vast network of tunnels in the Gaza Strip and is surrounded by hostages as human shields.\n\nLast week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nISRAEL'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE PREPARES FOR HEZBOLLAH RESPONSE AFTER IDF STRIKE: 'HIGH-ALERT'\n\nHamas' representative in Iran, Khaled Kaddoumi, called Sinwar a \"consensus choice\" popular among all factions and involved in the group's decision-making throughout, including in negotiations. In a voice message to The Associated Press, he said Sinwar knows the political aspirations of the Palestinians for a state and the return of refugees but he is also a \"fierce fighter on the battlefield.\"\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Sinwar \"has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the cease-fire.\"\n\nHe said Sinwar must \"decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire...It really is on him.\"\n\nSinwar has been Hamas' leader inside Gaza since 2017, ruling with an iron grip.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn May, the International Criminal Court sought an arrest warrant against Sinwar on charges of war crimes

Since his childhood, he was determined to resist the occupation.\"\n\nA high performer academically at school, he went on to study at the Islamic University in Gaza, where he helped pioneer the Islamic Bloc and held a number of student council positions at the university.\n\nIn 1982, Sinwar and other members of the student council had traveled to visit Palestinian women in Jenin who had allegedly been the victims of a poisoning attempt by Israelis.\n\nIt was in response to this visit that he was arrested and placed under administrative detention (held without charge nor trial) for six months, with the allegation against him being that he participated in subversive Islamist activities.\n\nWho is Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' Top Leader in Gaza? - PROFILE\n\nDuring his detention, Sinwar befriended other activists, such as Saleh Shehade who would go on to lead the armed wing of Hamas until his assassination in 2002.\n\nSinwar was responsible for setting up a security network, known as Majd.\n\nThe Majd operated in secret while the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned organization that preceded Hamas, the Mujamma Islamiyya, remained as a non-combative group until the establishment of Hamas in late 1987.\n\nIn 1988, Sinwar was arrested and allegedly tortured heavily for 6 weeks after the discovery of armed cells that belonged to the Majd.\n\nIn 1989, Hamas carried out its first significant armed attack, killing two Israeli soldiers. Sinwar was convicted on allegations of masterminding the attack and sentenced to 426 years of imprisonment.\n\nBeing the highest-profiled Hamas leader released in a 2011 prisoner swap deal, Sinwar returned to Gaza, eventually being elected as Hamas leader in the Strip, taking over from Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIn 2017, Hamas underwent a rebranding and update of its statute, which indicated that the Islamic Resistance Movement would be open to accepting a Two-State Solution.\n\nThat same year, Sinwar played a major role in attempting to repair ties between the Palestinian Authority (PA), led by the Fatah Party, and Hamas, but to no avail.\n\nFor These Reasons Israel Assassinated Hamas' Political Leader, Ismail Haniyeh - Analysis\n\nIn 2018, under the leadership of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas adopted the policy platform of non-violent resistance in a bid to open themselves up to diplomatic negotiations that could end the siege on Gaza.\n\nThe Hamas leadership endorsed the mass non-violent protest movement, known as the 'Great March of Return', which began on March 30, 2018.\n\nHowever, following the US decision to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the killing of hundreds of unarmed protesters at the hands of Israeli soldiers, Hamas changed its approach again.\n\nIn May 2021, Hamas launched the battle of Saif al-Quds , which was supported by several other armed groups inside the Gaza Strip.\n\nSince then, Yahya Sinwar's speeches and public appearances have made him a very popular celebrity leader throughout the Arab World.\n\nThe Palestine Chronicle believes that electing Sinwar carries deep meanings and symbolism:\n\nOne, it means that Hamas, in all of its branches, remains united.\n\nTwo, Hamas sees the Resistance in Gaza remains strong, united, organized, and capable of leading a long war of attrition against the Israeli occupation.\n\nThree, media reports, some circulated by major US media, that there is a conflict between Hamas' 'moderates' and 'hardliners' are not true.\n\nHaniyeh's Assassination -

We will come to you with endless rockets, we will come to you in a limitless flood of soldiers, we will come to you with millions of our people, like the repeating tide,\" he said in his address.\n\nLess than a year later, Israel discovered it was no idle threat, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's fence on Oct. 7, 2023, staging an assault that killed 1,200 people, took 152 hostage and broke Israel's reputation as an invincible enemy.\n\nSinwar, 61, who before Tuesday's announcement was the Hamas chief in Gaza, began his career as a ruthless enforcer who punished and killed collaborators with Israel, before rising to a leadership role after his release from prison in 2011 and his return to Gaza.\n\nThe war set off by the Oct. 7 attack laid waste to Gaza, as Israel sought to eliminate Hamas. Sinwar has been at the top of Israel's assassination list during the conflict.\n\nBy the time of the speech, Sinwar and the militant Islamists' military leader Mohammed Deif had already hatched secret plans for the Oct. 7 assault, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nHamas regarded the attack as a major victory against Israeli occupation, but it drew condemnation from the International Criminal Court.\n\nIts prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Sinwar, Deif and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response which reduced much of Gaza to rubble.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nHeard in hindsight, Sinwar's words foreshadowed what was to come, an attack Hamas dubbed the \"flood of Al-Aqsa,\" a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem that is one of Islam's holiest shrines and stands on a place revered by Jews as Temple Mount. Al-Aqsa has been subject to repeated Israeli raids.\n\nSinwar never made a public appearance after the Oct. 7 attacks, but directed military operations along with Deif and another commander. He also led negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps, possibly from bunkers beneath Gaza.\n\nIn the days after the Oct. 7 attacks, Sinwar was seen by some of the captured Israelis in the tunnels, freed hostages have said. Hamas and Israeli officials did not publicly comment on the reported sighting.\n\nThe question of hostages and prisoner swaps is deeply personal for Sinwar, who spent 23 years behind bars, and has vowed to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. He was one of 1,027 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in a swap for a single Israeli soldier held in Gaza in 2011.\n\n'DEAD MAN WALKING'\n\nBorn in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Sinwar was elected as Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017. After Oct. 7, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he and other leaders were \"living on borrowed time.\"\n\nBefore he was jailed, Sinwar rose to prominence as the head of the Al-Majd security apparatus which tracked and killed Palestinians accused of providing information on Hamas to Israel's secret service.\n\nBoth Hamas leaders and Israeli officials who know Sinwar agree he is devoted to the movement to an extraordinary level.\n\nOne Hamas figure based in Lebanon described him as \"puritanical ... with an amazing ability of endurance.\"\n\nMichael Koubi, a former Shin Bet official who interrogated Sinwar for 180 hours in prison, said he clearly stood out for his ability to intimidate and command. Koubi once asked the militant, then aged 28 or 29, why he was not already married.\n\n\"He told me Hamas is my wife, Hamas is my child. Hamas for me is everything.\"\n\nSinwar was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to consecutive life terms accused of planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians.\n\nIn jail, his hard line against collaborators continued, Israelis who dealt with him have said.\n\nAt times, \"he did not have Jewish blood on his hands, he had Palestinian blood on his hands,\" Yuval Bitton, previously head of the Israel Prison Service's intelligence division, told Channel 12 TV in October.\n\nBitton, a dentist who treated Sinwar, said Israeli medics removed a tumour in Sinwar's brain in 2004. \"We saved his life and this is his thanks,\" said Bitton, referring to Oct. 7. Bitton's nephew was killed during the attack and his body taken to Gaza by the militants.\n\nKoubi described Sinwar as being devoted to the destruction of Israel and to killing Jews. The senior Israeli official described him as a \"psychopath\", adding that \"I don't think the way he grasps reality is similar to more rational and pragmatic terrorists\".\n\nBitton added that the Hamas leader was willing to allow huge suffering for a cause and had once in prison led 1,600 prisoners to the brink of a mass hunger strike until death if needed in protest at the treatment of two men in isolation.\n\n\"He was ready to pay any price for the principle,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Israel's campaign in Gaza has since killed tens of thousands and devastated large swaths of the enclave.\n\nHaniyeh was killed in an explosion last week in Tehran, Iran, as he was attending the inauguration of Iran's new president. Hamas and Iran both blamed Israel for his assassination, although Israel has not publicly taken responsibility.\n\nIsraeli officials have vowed to take down Sinwar in retaliation for launching the Oct. 7 attack, which they say killed about 1,200 and led to roughly 250 being taken captive back to Gaza. Sinwar is widely believed to be hiding out in tunnels underneath the enclave to avoid Israeli assassination.\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Israel Katz, said in a post on social media platform X: \"The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organization off the face of the earth.\"\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official, said that Sinwar had been chosen unanimously and had been accepted by everyone in the movement.\n\nHamdan said it was \"too early\" to discuss how Sinwar's selection would affect the cease-fire talks. \"The team that followed the negotiations during the presence of Haniyeh will follow them under the supervision of Sinwar,\" he said.\n\nBorn in Khan Younis, Sinwar joined Hamas in the 1980s. He was later imprisoned on charges of murdering Palestinians accused of apostasy or of collaborating with Israel. He spent over two decades in prison in Israel and was ultimately freed in 2011, along with more than 1,000 other Palestinian prisoners, in exchange for a single Israeli soldier held by Hamas.\n\nThe leaders of Hamas's political office have usually been based outside Gaza or the West Bank as the role has often demanded travel. In Sinwar's case, it appeared unlikely that he would leave Gaza, even if he avoided being killed by Israel by the end of the war.\n\nFuad Khuffash, a Palestinian political analyst close to Hamas, said Sinwar's appointment was \"a symbolic decision\" that showed that many Hamas officials agree with his approach. \"It is more of an honorific than a practical matter,\" he said.\n\nEven before Oct. 7, Sinwar was in some ways more influential than Haniyeh within the organization in his role as Hamas's governor of Gaza. While Haniyeh served as a diplomatic face for the group abroad, Sinwar controlled events on the ground in Gaza and enjoyed close ties with Hamas's military wing, analysts said.\n\nSinwar has rarely surfaced since the Oct. 7 attacks, which prompted Israel's devastating 10-month military campaign in Gaza. But as Hamas's commander on the ground, he has played a decisive role in deciding whether the group will move toward a cease-fire with Israel.\n\nWithout Sinwar's approval, no truce could go forward, people with knowledge of the talks have said. Israeli officials and regional mediators have frequently spent days waiting for Hamas's leaders in Qatar to receive word from Sinwar.\n\nAnother top role in Hamas -- that of deputy political chief -- has remained vacant since Israel assassinated Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut in January. Khuffash suggested that role could be filled by Khalil al-Hayya, one of the group's chief negotiators with Israel, or Khaled Meshal, a former politburo chief. Both men had been seen as possible successors to Haniyeh.\n\nIn May, Karim Khan, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, announced that he would request warrants for the arrest of Sinwar and two other Hamas leaders. Khan said Sinwar, alongside the other Hamas officials, might have been responsible for severe crimes against humanity, including \"the killing of hundreds of Israeli civilians.\"\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a report from a prominent Israeli human rights group said Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli detention facilities since the Oct. 7 attacks have been subjected to systematic abuse, severe arbitrary violence, torture, and inhumane conditions.\n\nInvestigators from the group, B'Tselem, collected testimonies from 55 Palestinians jailed by Israel who said they were held in overcrowded cells, where they received little food and water and often faced physical abuse, including sleep deprivation and sexual violence.\n\nThe report said that Israel has over the years incarcerated hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, but detainees have experienced a \"massive increase in hostility from prison authorities\" since Oct. 7.\n\nIn a statement, Israel's prison service said that it operated according to the law, and that the report's accusations had not been formally filed with authorities. \"As far as we know, they are baseless,\" the prison service said, referring to the allegations in the report.\n\nThe report, titled \"Welcome to Hell,\" said that the \"abuse consistently described in the testimonies of dozens of people held in different detention facilities was so systemic that there is no room to doubt\" that it is a policy of Israeli prison authorities. It pointed to Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right Israeli national security minister and a crucial member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition, as the author of the policy.\n\nLast month, Israeli military police arrested several soldiers accused of abusing and using an object to anally rape a Palestinian detainee at Sde Teiman, according to court records and their attorneys.

We will come to you with endless rockets, we will come to you in a limitless flood of soldiers, we will come to you with millions of our people, like the repeating tide,\" he said in his address.\n\nLess than a year later, Israel discovered it was no idle threat, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's fence on Oct. 7, 2023, staging an assault that killed 1,200 people, took 152 hostage and broke Israel's reputation as an invincible enemy.\n\nSinwar, 61, who before Tuesday's announcement was the Hamas chief in Gaza, began his career as a ruthless enforcer who punished and killed collaborators with Israel, before rising to a leadership role after his release from prison in 2011 and his return to Gaza.\n\nThe war set off by the Oct. 7 attack laid waste to Gaza, as Israel sought to eliminate Hamas. Sinwar has been at the top of Israel's assassination list during the conflict.\n\nBy the time of the speech, Sinwar and the militant Islamists' military leader Mohammed Deif had already hatched secret plans for the Oct. 7 assault, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nHamas regarded the attack as a major victory against Israeli occupation, but it drew condemnation from the International Criminal Court.\n\nIts prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Sinwar, Deif and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response which reduced much of Gaza to rubble.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nHeard in hindsight, Sinwar's words foreshadowed what was to come, an attack Hamas dubbed the \"flood of Al-Aqsa,\" a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem that is one of Islam's holiest shrines and stands on a place revered by Jews as Temple Mount. Al-Aqsa has been subject to repeated Israeli raids.\n\nSinwar never made a public appearance after the Oct. 7 attacks, but directed military operations along with Deif and another commander. He also led negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps, possibly from bunkers beneath Gaza.\n\nIn the days after the Oct. 7 attacks, Sinwar was seen by some of the captured Israelis in the tunnels, freed hostages have said. Hamas and Israeli officials did not publicly comment on the reported sighting.\n\nThe question of hostages and prisoner swaps is deeply personal for Sinwar, who spent 23 years behind bars, and has vowed to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. He was one of 1,027 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in a swap for a single Israeli soldier held in Gaza in 2011.\n\n'DEAD MAN WALKING'\n\nBorn in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Sinwar was elected as Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017. After Oct. 7, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he and other leaders were \"living on borrowed time.\"\n\nBefore he was jailed, Sinwar rose to prominence as the head of the Al-Majd security apparatus which tracked and killed Palestinians accused of providing information on Hamas to Israel's secret service.\n\nBoth Hamas leaders and Israeli officials who know Sinwar agree he is devoted to the movement to an extraordinary level.\n\nOne Hamas figure based in Lebanon described him as \"puritanical ... with an amazing ability of endurance.\"\n\nMichael Koubi, a former Shin Bet official who interrogated Sinwar for 180 hours in prison, said he clearly stood out for his ability to intimidate and command. Koubi once asked the militant, then aged 28 or 29, why he was not already married.\n\n\"He told me Hamas is my wife, Hamas is my child. Hamas for me is everything.\"\n\nSinwar was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to consecutive life terms accused of planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians.\n\nIn jail, his hard line against collaborators continued, Israelis who dealt with him have said.\n\nAt times, \"he did not have Jewish blood on his hands, he had Palestinian blood on his hands,\" Yuval Bitton, previously head of the Israel Prison Service's intelligence division, told Channel 12 TV in October.\n\nBitton, a dentist who treated Sinwar, said Israeli medics removed a tumour in Sinwar's brain in 2004. \"We saved his life and this is his thanks,\" said Bitton, referring to Oct. 7. Bitton's nephew was killed during the attack and his body taken to Gaza by the militants.\n\nKoubi described Sinwar as being devoted to the destruction of Israel and to killing Jews. The senior Israeli official described him as a \"psychopath\", adding that \"I don't think the way he grasps reality is similar to more rational and pragmatic terrorists\".\n\nBitton added that the Hamas leader was willing to allow huge suffering for a cause and had once in prison led 1,600 prisoners to the brink of a mass hunger strike until death if needed in protest at the treatment of two men in isolation.\n\n\"He was ready to pay any price for the principle,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [],

Israel responded sharply.\n\n\"There is only reserved place for Yahya Sinwar, which is next to Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa,\" who Israeli forces killed for their involvement in Oct. 7 attacks that have ignited a war in the Gaza Strip, Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-speaking spokesman for Israel's army, commented on X.\n\nSinwar previously led Hamas's political bureau in 2017, six years after he was released from an Israeli jail during a prisoner exchange deal between Israel and the militant group. He later focused on reinforcing the group's military capabilities in preparation for wider conflict with the Jewish state.\n\nThe surprising selection of Sinwar was a message to Israel, said Mkhaimar Abusada, political science professor at Gaza's Al-Azhar University. \"It's meant to challenge Israel, and Hamas is saying 'if you killed the somewhat moderate Haniyeh, here is more of a hardliner and extremist on top of the group.'\"\n\nAaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said \"Sinwar and the Hamas terror surge of Oct. 7 is now the face of Hamas.\"\n\n\"His selection reaffirms what we've known for months now - Sinwar controls Hamas,\" said Miller, a former US State Department Middle East negotiator. \"It also lays to rest any illusions anyone might have had about its moderate or radical wings. Elevation is an endorsement of his policies.\"\n\nWith assistance from Peter Martin.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Endowment_for_International_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Azhar_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Azhar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2018/12/28/600x338/News_-_world_1545994908237.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 106, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The Iranian government and Hamas say that Israel carried out the assassination. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\nBecoming Hamas' political leader consolidates Sinwar's power within the movement but could cast uncertainty on next steps for ceasefire and hostage negotiations with Israel.\n\nAnalysts say that while Sinwar's viewpoint has always been critically influential in the negotiations, his difficulty in communicating with the outside world means that the details of negotiating with mediators from Qatar and Egypt have fallen to other Hamas officials, led by Haniyeh until his assassination last week.\n\n\"Even though Sinwar was not physically at the negotiating table with the mediators, he has been consulted at every critical juncture in the negotiations,\" CNN's Jeremy Diamond said Tuesday.\n\n\"That often contributed to delays in the negotiations, with it sometimes taking days for messages to reach him and for his response to be received by Hamas officials in Qatar or Cairo.\"\n\nA longtime figure in the Islamist Palestinian group, Sinwar was responsible for building up Hamas' military wing before forging important new ties with regional Arab powers as the group's civilian and political leader.\n\nHe was elected to Hamas' main decision-making body, the Politburo, in 2017 as the political leader of Hamas in Gaza branch. However, he has since become the Politburo's de facto leader, according to research by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR).\n\nHe has been designated a global terrorist by the US Department of State since 2015, and was sanctioned by the United Kingdom and France.\n\nSinwar may be one of the three most senior Hamas leaders in Gaza to remain alive. Israel said last week that Hamas' military chief Mohammed Deif, was killed in a strike it carried out in southern Gaza last month - a report Hamas has neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nIn March, the White House said Israel killed Marwan Issa, the second in command of the military wing.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was in the country to attend the swearing-in of Iran's newly-elected President Masoud Pezeshkian. Funeral services were held in Iran, led by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, but he was buried in Qatar, where the Political Bureau's offices are hosted. Qatar has been a pivotal mediator in ongoing talks to achieve a permanent ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza. Israeli and Egyptian intelligence chiefs met in Cairo on Saturday to continue to try to forge a deal despite predictions the Haniyeh assassination would derail the talks.\n\nHamas' Shura (consultative) council, the group's main deliberative body, is expected to meet in the coming days to formally name a new successor. The council's membership represents regional chapters of the group in Gaza, the West Bank and diaspora, and those imprisoned. A full leadership meeting may be complicated by their inability to convene due to operational security considerations - many of the group's nearly 60 members are hiding in Gaza from Israel's offensive, making them difficult to reach. Furthermore, it remains unclear exactly how much a newly elected Political Bureau leader will be able to influence or shape the group at the current time.\n\nIn large part because the Haniyeh killing occurred on Iranian territory, the Supreme Leader has vowed Iran will retaliate against Israel for the attack, joined by its \"Axis of Resistance\" partners, most notably Hezbollah. After nearly ten months of war with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Hamas, although still active militarily on the ground in Gaza, appears poorly positioned to join retaliatory strikes on Israel. U.S. officials, who say they were not given advanced notice of Israel's operation against Haniyeh but reportedly were briefed on it afterward, are urging Iran and its Axis partners not to risk intensifying the regional war by retaliating against Israel.\n\nRelations with Iran are one of the questions the next political leader of Hamas will face. Iran is a key financier, arms provider, and advisor to the group, but Sunni Arab governments - many of which engage with Hamas - remain wary of Iran and oppose Hamas' alignment with the Islamic Republic. Some potential successors to Haniyeh, including the group's de-facto Foreign Minister Khalid Meeshal, have tended to support closer relations with Sunni Muslim-dominated governments and maintain political distance from Tehran. Meeshal's relations with Iran, Syria, and Lebanese Hezbollah have been strained since he supported the Arab Spring protests in 2011, which, in Syria, nearly toppled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Even though Hamas reconciled with Iran in 2017, Hezbollah leaders reportedly refused to meet with him when he was in Lebanon in 2021. Hamas restored relations with the Assad regime in 2022. If Meshaal is confirmed as the new Hamas political leader, his relations with Tehran will likely be strained.\n\nIn contrast, Meeshal has maintained good relations with T\u00fcrkiye and Qatar, both of which expressed support for the Arab Spring uprisings as enfranchising a broader range of political movements in governance. Both countries have engaged with Hamas as part of an effort to moderate the group's stance on negotiating with Israel and its use of violence against Israeli civilians. Meeshal also has close ties to Jordan, another moderate Arab state and close U.S. ally. In 1997, Israel attempted to assassinate Meeshal in Jordan, but his life was saved when Jordan's leadership demanded Israel provide an antidote to the poison Israeli operatives had used to try to kill him.\n\nAside from external relationships, the next Hamas leader will face decisions on whether to continue to battle Israel as essentially a guerrilla and underground group or offer political compromises. Whoever is selected by the group's senior leaders to be the next paramount political chief will almost certainly come into immediate conflict and competition with Yahya Sinwar, the powerful Hamas figure leading the war in Gaza. Sinwar is not only ideologically hardline as the driving force behind the October 7 attack on Israel, but he also is in essential control of the organization's military and political forces on the ground in Gaza. Sinwar is in a position to accept or reject any ceasefire and hostage release agreement with Israel, and Hamas' leadership outside Gaza has limited ability to exert direct control over Sinwar's decisions and actions.\n\nIn his inevitable arguments with the external political leadership of the group, Sinwar can also count on the strong support of his brother Muhammad, who became the commander of Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade in 2005. Muhammad Sinwar oversees Hamas's military command structure in southern Gaza and was unsuccessfully targeted by Israel during the May 2021 Gaza war, during which he admitted to coordinating with Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nYahya Sinwar might also have the capability, given his control over the movement's forces and activists in Gaza, to shift consideration of Haniyeh's succession. Sinwar is said to favor the selection of Khalil al-Hayya for the role. Al-Hayya is the deputy head of Hamas's Political Bureau in the Gaza Strip, and his selection as Hamas leader would strengthen not only Sinwar but also other Hamas leaders who are in Gaza and not living abroad. Sinwar favors al-Hayya not only through personal ties but because they share a hardline ideology and favor close ties to Iran and Syria - downplaying ties to moderate Sunni Arab states. Al-Hayya traveled to the Pezeshkian inauguration with Haniyeh and, immediately after his death, issued hardline statements promising that: \"Hamas and the Palestinian people will not stop the resistance march...The resistance vows to respond to this aggression, and the Zionist entity deserves to pay a heavy price for this crime.\"\n\nA ceasefire deal that ends the Gaza war will also present the next Hamas political leader with a dilemma whether to bury its longstanding feud with its main rivals for Palestinian support - Fatah and the PLO - which dominate the PA. Hamas expelled PA officials and security authorities from Gaza forcibly in 2007, and the two have failed to reconcile since. Over the past several weeks, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has relented on his earlier opposition to a PA role in securing and governing post-war Gaza. The evolving Israeli stance on the \"day after\" in Gaza has stimulated new debates within Hamas on unifying with Fatah and the PLO and playing a potential role in post-war governance in Gaza. However, Israeli leaders continue to object to any Hamas role in post-war governance in Gaza, even if done as a subordinate to PA officials.\n\nKhalid Meeshal's perceived openness to rebuilding ties to Fatah, the PLO, and the PA might explain why PA President Mahmoud Abbas called Meeshal to offer his condolences for the killing of Haniyeh. Another senior Hamas political figure, sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Haniyeh, Musa Abu Marzuq, also appears open to reconciling with the PA. Marzuq lost a May 2017 Hamas election to replace Meeshal but has since continued to serve as a senior member of the group's Political Bureau. Abu Marzuq represented Hamas at talks with Fatah representatives in Beijing that, on July 23, yielded an agreement on \"ending division and strengthening Palestinian unity.\" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi characterized the pact as an agreement \"on post-Gaza war governance and the establishment of a provisional national reconciliation government.\" Yet, Wang affirmed the view of Beijing and of most Middle Eastern and global governments that \"...the PLO is the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinian people\" - a position at odds with the goals of Hamas hardliners. The agreement, despite its uncertain implementation, nonetheless benefitted China's efforts to present itself as a potential peace broker in the conflict and a key player in the region.\n\nEven as it attempts to sort out its internal divisions, stances on key issues, and external relations, any Haniyeh successor and his allies will also face unrelenting operational pressure from Israel. The Netanyahu government has vowed to eliminate all Hamas leaders in and outside Gaza, even though the political leadership outside Gaza might not have had any involvement in the October 7 attack. Since the beginning of 2024, Israel has killed several top Hamas leaders and commanders both in and outside the Gaza Strip. In January, an Israeli airstrike killed Haniyeh's deputy Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. Arouri would have been favored to replace Haniyeh and his post has remained empty since his death. In March, Israel killed the group's deputy chief of military operations, Marwan Issa, in central Gaza. And, one day after Haniyeh's death in Tehran, the IDF confirmed that its July 13 airstrike in Gaza had successfully killed Hamas' military commander, Mohammed Deif, the purported operational mastermind of the October 7 attack. That strike marked the highest-ranking Hamas official in the Gaza Strip to be eliminated by Israeli forces since the onset of the war. Many argue Netanyahu will resist agreeing to withdraw the IDF from Gaza unless and until Sinwar is captured or killed.", "source": {"uri": "thesoufancenter.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

So, by choosing him as the head of its political bureau, Hamas is sending a message of defiance to the Israeli government.\n\nBut it remains unclear how Sinwar will be able to communicate with fellow Hamas operatives, run the day-to-day political operations of the movement, and oversee Gaza ceasefire negotiations while in hiding.\n\nIsraeli officials have made no secret of their desire to kill him.\n\nBorn in 1962 in Khan Younis, Sinwar is often portrayed as one of the most uncompromising top Hamas officials. He was arrested by Israel repeatedly in the early 1980s for his involvement in anti-occupation activism at the Islamic University in Gaza.\n\nAfter his graduation, he helped establish a network of fighters to take up armed resistance against Israel. The group would later become the Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas.\n\nSinwar joined Hamas as one of its leaders almost as soon as the group was founded by Shaikh Ahmad Yasin in 1987. The following year, he was arrested by the Israeli forces and handed four life sentences - the equivalent of 426 in jail - for alleged involvement in the capture and killing of two Israeli soldiers and four suspected Palestinian spies.\n\nHe spent 23 years in Israeli jail where he learned Hebrew and became well versed in Israeli affairs and domestic politics. He was freed in 2011 as part of the prisoner exchange deal that saw the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been captured by Hamas.\n\nAfter his release, Sinwar quickly rose through Hamas's ranks again. In 2012, he was elected to the group's political bureau and was tasked with coordinating with the Qassam Brigades.\n\nHe played a leading political and military role during Israel's seven-week offensive against Gaza in 2014. The next year, the United States labelled Sinwar as a \"specially designated global terrorist\".\n\nIn 2017, Sinwar became Hamas's chief in Gaza, succeeding Haniyeh, who was elected as the chair of the group's political bureau.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had travelled regionally and delivered speeches throughout the continuing war on Gaza, until his assassination, Sinwar has been tight-lipped since October 7.\n\nBut in a 2021 interview with Vice News, Sinwar said that while Palestinians do not seek war due to its high cost, they will not \"wave the white flag\".\n\n\"For long periods, we tried peaceful and popular resistance. We expected that the world, free people and international organisations would stand by our people and stop occupation from committing crimes and massacring our people. Unfortunately, the world stood by and watched,\" he said.\n\nSinwar was likely describing the Great March of Return, during which Palestinians protested every week for months on end at the Gaza border in 2018 and 2019, but met a violent Israeli crackdown that killed more than 220 people and injured many more.\n\nAsked about Hamas's tactics, including firing indiscriminate rockets that could harm civilians, Sinwar said Palestinians are fighting with the means at their disposal. He accused Israel of deliberately killing Palestinian civilians en masse, despite having advanced, precise weaponry.\n\n\"Does the world expect us to be well-behaved victims while we are being killed, for us to be slaughtered without making a noise?\" Sinwar had said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_University_of_Gaza", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic University of Gaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilad_Shalit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gilad Shalit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018\u20132019_Gaza_border_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2018\u20132019 Gaza border protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Who-is-Yahya-Sinwar-Ismail-Haniyehs-successor-as-Hamas-chief.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 241, "textEnd": 248}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 287, "textEnd": 296, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

walking'", "body": "Gaza Strip (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - After a career in the shadows, spent in Israeli prisons and the internal security apparatus of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar has emerged as leader of the Palestinian group in the middle of a full-blown war.\n\nSinwar, who until now was the movement's Gaza chief, replaces Ismail Haniyeh, whose killing in Tehran last week sent tensions soaring across the Middle East and raised fears of a coordinated attack on Israel by Iran and its regional proxies.\n\nBy choosing him as the group's chief Hamas \"is sending a strong message to the occupation that Hamas continues its path of resistance\", a senior Hamas official told AFP.\n\nSinwar stands accused of masterminding the group's October 7 attacks, the worst in Israel's history, which left 1,198 dead and 251 taken hostage according to an AFP tally and Israeli official figures.\n\nIn the aftermath of that attack, the Israeli military insisted he was a \"dead man walking\", although Sinwar has not been seen since.\n\nThe October 7 attack was probably a year or two in the planning, \"took everyone by surprise\" and \"changed the balance of power on the ground\", said Leila Seurat of the Arab Centre for Research and Political Studies (CAREP) in Paris.\n\nThe ascetic 61-year-old is a security operator \"par excellence\", according to Abu Abdallah, a Hamas member who spent years alongside him in Israeli jails.\n\n\"He makes decisions in the utmost calm, but is intractable when it comes to defending the interests of Hamas,\" Abu Abdallah told AFP in 2017, after his former co-detainee was elected Hamas's leader in Gaza.\n\nPunishing collaborators\n\nAfter October 7, Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht called Sinwar the \"face of evil\" and declared him a \"dead man walking\".\n\nBorn in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in southern Gaza, Sinwar joined Hamas when Sheikh Ahmad Yassin founded the group around the time the first Palestinian intifada began in 1987.\n\nSinwar set up the group's internal security apparatus the following year and went on to head an intelligence unit dedicated to flushing out and mercilessly punishing -- sometimes killing -- Palestinians accused of providing information to Israel.\n\nAccording to a transcript of an interrogation with security officials published in Israeli media, Sinwar professed to have strangled an alleged collaborator with a keffiyeh scarf in a Khan Yunis cemetery.\n\nA graduate of the Islamic University in Gaza, he learned perfect Hebrew during his 23 years in Israeli jails and is said to have a deep understanding of Israeli culture and society.\n\nHe was serving four life terms for the killing of two Israeli soldiers when he became the most senior of 1,027 Palestinians released in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in 2011.\n\nSinwar later became a senior commander in the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, before taking overall leadership of the movement in Gaza.\n\nWhile his predecessor, Haniyeh, had encouraged efforts by Hamas to present a moderate face to the world, Sinwar has preferred to force the Palestinian issue to the fore by more violent means.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says Israel's withering aerial and ground assault launched in response to the October 7 attacks has killed at least 39,653 people in the Palestinian territory.\n\n'Radical and pragmatic'\n\nSinwar dreams of a single Palestinian state bringing together the Gaza Strip, the occupied West Bank -- controlled by Mahmud Abbas's Fatah party -- and annexed east Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, he has vowed to punish anyone obstructing reconciliation with Fatah, the rival political movement with which Hamas engaged in factional fighting after elections in 2006.\n\nThat coming together remains elusive, but the prisoner releases resulting from the brief November truce agreement with Israel have seen Hamas's popularity soar in the West Bank.\n\nSinwar has pursued a path of being \"radical in military planning and pragmatic in politics\", according to Seurat.\n\n\"He doesn't advocate force for force's sake, but to bring about negotiations\" with Israel, she said.\n\nThe Hamas chief was added to the US list of the most wanted \"international terrorists\" in 2015.\n\nSecurity sources outside Gaza say that Sinwar has taken refuge in the network of tunnels built under the territory to withstand Israeli bombs.\n\nVowing in November to \"find and eliminate\" Sinwar, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant urged Gazans to turn Sinwar in, adding \"if you reach him before us, it will shorten the war\".", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news",

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area. The Palestinian territory faces a severe humanitarian crisis as its Health Ministry says the death toll in the war approaches 40,000.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHamas' new leader is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nBiden and Egypt's El-Sisi speak about 'final stage' of negotiations\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli airstike on house in central Gaza kills 3, injures 20 others\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nEgypt working with China to reduce tensions in the Middle East\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nPalestinians in Gaza still struggling to get food and clean water\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah vows to retaliate against Israel for Beirut airstrike\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nAt least 19 hurt in northern Israel after Hezbollah launches drone strikes\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nUltra-Orthodox protesters enter Israeli military base, objecting to draft order\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nHezbollah launches drone attack in northern Israel, wounding at least 7\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nThe only humanitarian air corridor into southern Gaza is shut down\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nAn Israeli strike on a village in south Lebanon kills 4, Health Ministry says\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nAn Israeli officer is stabbed on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police say\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\n10 Palestinians are killed and 10 wounded in Israeli raids in the West Bank\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nAustralia's prime minister condemns Iranian ambassador's comments on social media as 'abhorrent'\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

We will come to you with endless rockets, we will come to you in a limitless flood of soldiers, we will come to you with millions of our people, like the repeating tide,\" he said in his address.\n\nLess than a year later, Israel discovered it was no idle threat, when Hamas fighters broke through Gaza's fence on Oct. 7, 2023, staging an assault that killed 1,200 people, took 152 hostage and broke Israel's reputation as an invincible enemy.\n\nSinwar, 61, who before Tuesday's announcement was the Hamas chief in Gaza, began his career as a ruthless enforcer who punished and killed collaborators with Israel, before rising to a leadership role after his release from prison in 2011 and his return to Gaza.\n\nThe war set off by the Oct. 7 attack laid waste to Gaza, as Israel sought to eliminate Hamas. Sinwar has been at the top of Israel's assassination list during the conflict.\n\nBy the time of the speech, Sinwar and the militant Islamists' military leader Mohammed Deif had already hatched secret plans for the Oct. 7 assault, the deadliest day in Israel's 75-year history.\n\nHamas regarded the attack as a major victory against Israeli occupation, but it drew condemnation from the International Criminal Court.\n\nIts prosecutor said he had requested arrest warrants for Sinwar, Deif and another Hamas figure over the attack, and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Nentanyahu and his defence chief over Israel's response which reduced much of Gaza to rubble.\n\nBoth Israel and Hamas dismissed the accusations and said they objected to the way the announcement of the request on the same day appeared to equate them with each other - though they faced different charges.\n\nHeard in hindsight, Sinwar's words foreshadowed what was to come, an attack Hamas dubbed the \"flood of Al-Aqsa,\" a reference to the mosque in Jerusalem that is one of Islam's holiest shrines and stands on a place revered by Jews as Temple Mount. Al-Aqsa has been subject to repeated Israeli raids.\n\nSinwar never made a public appearance after the Oct. 7 attacks, but directed military operations along with Deif and another commander. He also led negotiations for prisoner-hostage swaps, possibly from bunkers beneath Gaza.\n\nIn the days after the Oct. 7 attacks, Sinwar was seen by some of the captured Israelis in the tunnels, freed hostages have said. Hamas and Israeli officials did not publicly comment on the reported sighting.\n\nThe question of hostages and prisoner swaps is deeply personal for Sinwar, who spent 23 years behind bars, and has vowed to free all Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. He was one of 1,027 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons in a swap for a single Israeli soldier held in Gaza in 2011.\n\nBorn in the Khan Younis refugee camp, Sinwar was elected as Hamas' leader in Gaza in 2017. After Oct. 7, Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he and other leaders were \"living on borrowed time.\"\n\nBefore he was jailed, Sinwar rose to prominence as the head of the Al-Majd security apparatus which tracked and killed Palestinians accused of providing information on Hamas to Israel's secret service.\n\nBoth Hamas leaders and Israeli officials who know Sinwar agree he is devoted to the movement to an extraordinary level.\n\nOne Hamas figure based in Lebanon described him as \"puritanical ... with an amazing ability of endurance.\"\n\nMichael Koubi, a former Shin Bet official who interrogated Sinwar for 180 hours in prison, said he clearly stood out for his ability to intimidate and command. Koubi once asked the militant, then aged 28 or 29, why he was not already married.\n\n\"He told me Hamas is my wife, Hamas is my child. Hamas for me is everything.\"\n\nSinwar was arrested in 1988 and sentenced to consecutive life terms accused of planning the abduction and murder of two Israeli soldiers and the murder of four Palestinians.\n\nIn jail, his hard line against collaborators continued, Israelis who dealt with him have said.\n\nAt times, \"he did not have Jewish blood on his hands, he had Palestinian blood on his hands,\" Yuval Bitton, previously head of the Israel Prison Service's intelligence division, told Channel 12 TV in October.\n\nBitton, a dentist who treated Sinwar, said Israeli medics removed a tumour in Sinwar's brain in 2004. \"We saved his life and this is his thanks,\" said Bitton, referring to Oct. 7. Bitton's nephew was killed during the attack and his body taken to Gaza by the militants.\n\nKoubi described Sinwar as being devoted to the destruction of Israel and to killing Jews. The senior Israeli official described him as a \"psychopath\", adding that \"I don't think the way he grasps reality is similar to more rational and pragmatic terrorists\".\n\nBitton added that the Hamas leader was willing to allow huge suffering for a cause and had once in prison led 1,600 prisoners to the brink of a mass hunger strike until death if needed in protest at the treatment of two men in isolation.\n\n\"He was ready to pay any price for the principle,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area. The Palestinian territory faces a severe humanitarian crisis as its Health Ministry says the death toll in the war approaches 40,000.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHamas' new leader is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nBiden and Egypt's El-Sisi speak about 'final stage' of negotiations\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli airstike on house in central Gaza kills 3, injures 20 others\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nEgypt working with China to reduce tensions in the Middle East\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nPalestinians in Gaza still struggling to get food and clean water\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah vows to retaliate against Israel for Beirut airstrike\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nAt least 19 hurt in northern Israel after Hezbollah launches drone strikes\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nUltra-Orthodox protesters enter Israeli military base, objecting to draft order\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nHezbollah launches drone attack in northern Israel, wounding at least 7\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nThe only humanitarian air corridor into southern Gaza is shut down\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nAn Israeli strike on a village in south Lebanon kills 4, Health Ministry says\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nAn Israeli officer is stabbed on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police say\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\n10 Palestinians are killed and 10 wounded in Israeli raids in the West Bank\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nAustralia's prime minister condemns Iranian ambassador's comments on social media as 'abhorrent'\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent ways.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins All Injuries Law Firm\n\nEnergyCAP Appoints Shawn Lankton as Chief Executive Officer\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over

That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him\".\n\nDeif, viewed as Sinwar's second in command, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza last month.\n\nSinwar, who has not appeared in public since Oct 7, will now become more powerful as the overall leader of Hamas.\n\nHaving spent over 20 years in Israeli jail, he speaks fluent Hebrew and was even saved by Israeli surgeons who removed his brain tumour in 2004.\n\nHaniyeh was Hamas's main negotiator in the ceasefire talks prior to his death in an explosion while visiting the Iranian capital last week and it is unclear how the fragile peace negotiations will be affected by the decision.\n\nThe Hamas delegation negotiating a ceasefire with Israel will now be supervised by Sinwar.\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas official based in Beirut, hailed the \"unanimous\" decision to appoint Sinwar as the new leader.\n\n\"It's too early to predict what the process will lead to,\" Hamdan added.\n\nChoice was surprise to observers\n\nThe decision by Hamas's religious Shura council to appoint Sinwar is viewed as a surprise by experts in the Middle East who had speculated that Khaled Mashal, Haniyeh's predecessor, would return as political leader.\n\nKhalil Al-Hayya, deputy leader of Hamas's Gaza regional politburo, was considered an alternative option.\n\nHaniyeh was first elected political leader of Hamas in 2017 and was re-elected by the Shura council again in 2021.\n\nWhile it is widely believed that Israel was behind the killing of Haniyeh, Benjamin Netanyahu's government is yet to officially claim responsibility.\n\nClick here to view this content.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jotam_confino@aol.co.uk", "name": "Jotam Confino",

leader", "body": "TERROR group Hamas has named Yahya Sinwar, the ruthless mastermind behind the deadly October 7 attacks, as their new leader.\n\nSinwar, dubbed Gaza's Bin Laden, has taken over from former chief Ismail Haniyeh after he was assassinated by a suspected Israeli rocket last week.\n\nEvil Sinwar has been cowering out in the war-torn Gaza strip for months after he became the Israel Defense Forces primary target for his despicable role in the civilian massacre 10 months ago.\n\nThe Hamas boss is regarded as the architect of the assault that saw 1,200 people murdered and another 250 taken hostage.\n\nLast man standing Sinwar has evaded Israeli assassination in Gaza during the ensuing war.\n\nHe is believed to be hiding in the tunnels under the city, used by the terror group to move, transport weapons and even hold hostages.\n\nHamas released a statement announcing Sinwar's new role today.\n\nThe militant group said: \"The Islamic resistance movement Hamas announces the selection of Commander Yahya Sinwar as the head of the political bureau of the movement, succeeding the martyr Commander Ismail Haniyeh, may Allah have mercy on him.\"\n\nTerror squad Hezbollah, who are backed by Israel's enemy Iran, congratulated Sinwar as they sent out a chilling message.\n\nThe appointment \"confirms goals that the enemy [Israel] seeks from killing leaders and officials failed in achieving its outcome\", they said.\n\nBefore saying it sends \"a strong message\" to Israel and the US that \"the Hamas movement is united in its decision, solid in its principles, firm in its important choices, and determined\" to continue to fight.\n\nSinwar's ascendancy up the ranks is set to only anger the IDF and Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu further.\n\nIsrael's military chiefs have repeatedly vowed that their renewed offensive must not end until he is dead.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters today that Israel will have to come to terms with Sinwar's new role as the \"primary decider\" in any Hamas related decisions.\n\nSaying Sinwar will now play a crucial role in ceasefire talks.\n\nA regional diplomat, who has been close to the ceasefire talks in recent months, added: \"The appointment means that Israel needs to face Sinwar over a solution to Gaza war.\"\n\nSinwar previously spent 22 years in an Israeli prison for terrorism, murder and kidnap plots before he helped orchestrate the October 7 massacre.\n\nWanted posters shared online, not by the IDF, previously appeared to offer a \u00a325,000 reward to Palestinians who turned him in.\n\nBombshell documents previously revealed the chilling confessions of the warlord who, in his own words, described how he became a serial killer in Palestine as he rose through the terrorist ranks.\n\nThe secret documents from the Israeli Shin Bet intelligence service give detailed accounts of his killings - even reportedly showing where he had dumped and buried his victims' bodies.\n\nEncouraged by his proud mentor, he freely admitted his role with Majd - Hamas' \"security service\" - as he took interrogators through each gruesome killing.\n\nThe shifting Hamas leadership comes just a week after Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was assassinated in Tehran.\n\nA rocket fired from a drone in a feat of incredible precision took out the terror boss as he slept soundly in Iran's capital.\n\nJust days after the IDF announced that a strike on Khan Younis, southern Gaza, had killed Mohammed Deif on July 13.\n\nThe 58-year-old terror kingpin had worked as head of Hamas' ruthless military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, since 2002.\n\nMarwan Issa, Sinwar's righthand man dubbed the \"Shadow Man\" for his ability to dodge assassination attempts, was also taken out this year.\n\nHe was killed on March 10 during an operation in the Gaza Strip, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari confirmed at the time.\n\nIssa was the deputy commander of Hamas' military wing and acted as one of Yahya Sinwar's henchmen.\n\nAyman Nofal, Hamas' commander in the centre of Gaza, was also taken out by an Israeli airstrike - but in October 2023.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Most of the Hamas leadership had moved to a life of safety and luxury in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar.\n\nSinwar's promotion comes at an inopportune time for the seasoned terrorist. Most of his lieutenants have been eliminated by the Israeli military since October 7, including Mohammed Deif, who was killed in last month's airstrike.\n\nSinwar is believed to be hiding somewhere around Rafah and Khan Tunis area, a Hamas dominated region in southern Gaza. He and other Hamas terror commanders are using the remaining Israeli hostages as human shields as Israeli military combs the area, intelligence reports suggest.\n\nThe Associated Press reported the change at the helm of the Iran-backed terror group:\n\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike. Also last week, Israel said it had confirmed the death of the head of Hamas' military wing, Mohammed Deif, in a July airstrike in Gaza. Hamas has not confirmed his death.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nWith Iran-sponsored Hezbollah continuing to fire rockets and suicide drones into Israel, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been taking out commanders and operatives waging the terrorist offensive from southern Lebanon.\n\nAfter a Hezbollah missile killed 12 children on a soccer field in Golan Heights, Hezbollah has ramped up cross-border fire toward Israeli towns and cities.\n\nAt least 19 Israelis were reported injured when a Hezbollah drone hit the northern Israeli town of Nahariya.\n\n\"Nineteen people were injured Tuesday, one of them critically, after a Hezbollah drone attack on the Western Galilee. At least one of those injured was wounded as the result of an Iron Dome interceptor missile that malfunctioned, the Israel Defense Forces later said,\" The Times of Israel reported. \"The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it treated victims at three locations in the Nahariya area.

Israel was able to intercept almost all of the incoming projectiles with the help of the U.S. and Western allies.\n\nOfficials in the US-led multinational coalition that is reportedly preparing to assist in repelling an expected Iranian attack have preemptively warned Israel not to respond too strongly to such an assault, according to a Tuesday report.\n\n\"Don't push it,\" the unnamed officials told Jerusalem, according to Kan news. \"Think carefully before you attack in return. The goal at the end of the day is not to lead to an all-out war.\" (...)\n\nKan reported on Monday that Western diplomats believe the same coalition can come together again.\n\nIran said Monday Israel must be \"punished\" for Hamas terror group leader Ismail Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran -- allegedly by Israel -- and has vowed to take action, raising worries that its response could bring the restive Middle East closer to all-out war. (...)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed US officials, reported that Iran has in recent days been moving missile launchers and carrying out military exercises, in a signal that it may be preparing to carry out an attack in the coming days.\n\nThe Biden administration is telling Israel to show restraint in the face of an impending large-scale attack a day after Iranian-backed terrorist militias attacked a U.S. military base in western Iraq, injuring several American servicemen.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday:\n\nSeveral U.S. personnel were injured in a suspected rocket attack at a military base in Iraq, U.S. defense officials said Monday, in what has been a recent uptick in strikes on American forces by Iranian-backed militias. (...)\n\nThe U.S. defense officials said troops at al-Asad air base were still assessing the injuries and damage, and it appeared that as many as seven military troops and civilians were injured. Earlier Monday, Iraqi security officials confirmed the attack, but no group has claimed responsibility.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike over the weekend eliminated Jaber Aziz, a senior Hamas terrorist commander. Aziz was hiding in a Hamas command center build under two schools in northern Gaza.\n\nOn Sunday, \"the IDF struck Hamas terrorists who operated in a Hamas command and control center that was embedded within the \"Hassan Salame\" and \"Nasser\" schools in Gaza City,\" the Israeli military said in a press release Monday. \"According to IDF and ISA intelligence, during the strike in the area of the \"Hassan Salame\" school, the terrorist Jaber Aziz, Commander of Hamas' Al-Furqan Battalion, was eliminated along with additional terrorists.\"\n\nThe IDF revealed the key role played by the slain terrorist commander:\n\nAziz has been the Commander of Hamas' Al-Furqan Battalion since 2020. He was previously the Deputy Commander of the Al-Furqan Battalion, Deputy Commander of the Zaytun Battalion, and the Commander of the Zaytun Battalion.\n\nAziz took a significant part in the planning of the October 7th massacre and led the preparations and training of the Al-Furqan Battalion. He also participated in the infiltration into communities near the Gaza Strip on October 7th.\n\nThroughout the war, he was responsible for directing and promoting numerous terror attacks against the IDF and the State of Israel. Aziz was a key operative in the war management of Hamas' Gaza Brigade. His elimination significantly degrades the capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization.\n\nIsraeli armed forces also eliminated Mohammed Mahasneh, head of Hamas' weapons and equipment smuggling operation.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force \"conducted an intelligence-based strike, eliminating the terrorist Mohammed Mahasneh, a Hamas commander responsible for smuggling operations, including the smuggling in and out of the Gaza Strip of military equipment used for terrorist activities,\" the IDF disclosed in a press release Tuesday. \"Mahasneh was primarily involved in smuggling operations at sea, but also operated to smuggle equipment through tunnels and border crossings. His elimination significantly degrades the capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organization to smuggle equipment into the Gaza Strip,\" the military added.\n\nThe IDF took out Hamas's so-called 'Economy Minister,' Abdel Fattah Al-Zeriei, who was responsible for arming the terrorist group and diverting humanitarian aid to jihad fighters.\n\nThe i24NEWS reported Monday:\n\nAn airstrike carried out by the Israel Defense Forces on Sunday killed Hamas's economy minister in the Gaza Strip, according to a statement by the IDF spokesperson's unit on Monday.\n\nAbdel Fattah Al-Zeriei, \"a terrorist operative in the Manufacturing Department of Hamas' Military Wing, who also served as Hamas' Minister of Economy in the Gaza Strip,\" was killed.\n\n\"The Manufacturing Department operates to increase Hamas' weapons capabilities, including by exchanging information with other terrorist organizations across the Middle East,\" the IDF said.\n\n\"Al-Zeriei had a significant role in directing Hamas' efforts to seize control of humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip and in managing Hamas-controlled markets.

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area. The Palestinian territory faces a severe humanitarian crisis as its Health Ministry says the death toll in the war approaches 40,000.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHamas' new leader is Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attacks\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nBiden and Egypt's El-Sisi speak about 'final stage' of negotiations\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli airstike on house in central Gaza kills 3, injures 20 others\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nEgypt working with China to reduce tensions in the Middle East\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nPalestinians in Gaza still struggling to get food and clean water\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah vows to retaliate against Israel for Beirut airstrike\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nAt least 19 hurt in northern Israel after Hezbollah launches drone strikes\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nUltra-Orthodox protesters enter Israeli military base, objecting to draft order\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nHezbollah launches drone attack in northern Israel, wounding at least 7\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nThe only humanitarian air corridor into southern Gaza is shut down\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nAn Israeli strike on a village in south Lebanon kills 4, Health Ministry says\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nAn Israeli officer is stabbed on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police say\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\n10 Palestinians are killed and 10 wounded in Israeli raids in the West Bank\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nAustralia's prime minister condemns Iranian ambassador's comments on social media as 'abhorrent'\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@idahostatejournal.com", "name": "Associated Press",

He is considered a cunning and ruthless operator, and the hardest of Hamas hard-liners.\n\nMeet the new Hamas boss: As the Who might have sung, he's the same as the old boss. The terror organization's Gaza leader and architect of the October 7 attacks against Israel, Yehyeh Sinwar, on Tuesday was chosen to replace its politburo chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed last week at Tehran.\n\nMr. Sinwar is the brain behind the October atrocities that launched a Mideast war now in its 10th month. As the official new political chief, he will replace Haniyeh and become the Hamas representative in the American-backed negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nYet, Mr. Sinwar -- who is widely believed to be hiding in a maze of Gaza tunnels, surrounded by dozens of hostages that he uses as human shields -- has always had the final say on what conditions Hamas will, or will not, accept in a possible war-ending deal. He has also been considered a cunning and ruthless operator, and the hardest of Hamas hard-liners.\n\nLast week, the Israel Defense Force confirmed that on July 13 it killed the Gaza military chief, Mohamed Deif. Also last week, Haniyeh was killed while visiting Tehran. Two of the leadership's survivors, Mr. Sinwar and his younger brother, Mohammed, are considered top targets, and many Israelis believe that unless they are eliminated the war will never end.\n\n\"Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history on October 7th,\" the IDF spokesman, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told Al Arabiya television Tuesday. \"There is only one place for Sinwar, and that is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7th terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\n\"We need to kill him,\" a former prime minister, Naftali Bennet, told Fox News. \"We need to defeat Hamas and have them release the hostages.\" He suggested that for that purpose Israel would be willing to exile some leaders, \"put them on a ship and get them out of Gaza.\"\n\nFor now, by officially crowning Mr. Sinwar political chief, Hamas is cutting the negotiations' middleman, a role that until now was assigned to the Doha-based Haniyeh. Prior to his death, Mr. Sinwar communicated with Haniyeh, instructing him on every step of the cease-fire negotiations before relating them to Qatari and Egyptian negotiators.\n\nInternally, Mr. Sinwar's selection represents a complete takeover of the terror group by its Gaza-based, pro-Iran faction. The Egypt-born Haniyeh was also a member of that group, yet his life of affluence in fancy Doha hotels has turned many Gazans against him. Mr. Sinwar, in contrast, is either despised or admired by the Strip's residents, but he is seen as one of their own.\n\nFor days, though, the speculation among Hamas watchers has been that Khaled Mashal, who served as the organization's political chief between 1996 and 2017, would return to the post after Haniyeh's death. Mr. Mashal is considered closest to the Qatari regime, and has opposed Hamas's ever-tighter relations with Iran, which both Haniyeh and Mr. Sinwar cultivated.\n\nIn 1997, when Mr. Mashal was at Amman, Jordan, Israel injected him with a lethal poisonous substance. Yet, the Mossad agents were captured by the local police. In a deal for their release, Israel was forced to deliver an antidote that saved Mr. Mashal's life. Despite his prominence, though, Mr. Mashal seems to have been overlooked in the latest leadership shuffle.\n\nThe selection seems to have been haphazard, made as speculation regarding Haniyeh's replacement grew over the region. On Monday a new name surfaced, apparently leaked by someone in the Hamas ranks: According to several Mideast reports, Abu Omar Hassan, also known as Mohamed Ismail Darwish, has been named as interim Hamas chief until an election for a permanent Haniyeh replacement is to be conducted next year.\n\nThe name, though, was largely unknown. \"I've been covering this beat for years and I never heard of him,\" a Palestinian affairs analyst for Israel's Kan news, Elior Levy, said. \"So I asked sources in Gaza and the West Bank, and they never heard of him either. Nor did my Israeli intelligence contacts.\" In other words, Mr. Levy said, \"This sounds like a made-up person.\"\n\nThe episode might indicate that Hamas could be less organized than widely portrayed. Or it could be that Mr. Sinwar has leaked it. Either way, the man who has spent years in Israeli prisons for organizing suicide bombings is now the unchallenged Hamas chief. Also, he has the backing of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.\n\nYet, targeting by Israel could shorten the new boss's tenure and deal a major blow to Hamas. Mr. Sinwar is \"running the group from tunnels under Gaza while he is being hunted by Israel,\" the Foundation for Defense of Democracies's vice president for research, Jonathan Schanzer, writes on X. \"Hamas is unraveling.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benny_avni@nysun.com", "name": "Benny Avni", "type": "author",

Now, he will also replace Ismail Haniyeh, the group's previous political leader and a key liaison in the indirect cease-fire talks with Israel. Mr. Haniyeh, who had been living in Qatar, was killed in an explosion in Iran last week that has been widely attributed to Israel.\n\nA hard-line figure born in Gaza, Mr. Sinwar, 61, is a prime target for Israeli forces and is widely believed to be hiding out in tunnels underneath the enclave to avoid Israeli attack. Despite that, he is thought to have been dictating the group's position in the cease-fire talks.\n\nHis selection to lead the group's political office comes as the Middle East braces for Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, to strike Israel in response to the killings last week of Mr. Haniyeh and a senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr.\n\nHamas and Iran have blamed Israel for planting the bomb that killed Mr. Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Tehran, after he attended the inauguration of the country's new president. Israel has declined to comment on Mr. Haniyeh's death, but U.S. officials have privately assessed that Israel was behind it.\n\nThe supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has promised to respond with a \"harsh punishment.\" And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has said that his country will \"exact a heavy price for any act of aggression against us, from whatever quarter.\"\n\nAmid frenzied diplomatic efforts to prevent the violence from mushrooming into a wider regional war, the United States has ordered additional combat aircraft and warships that can intercept missiles, rockets and drones, to the Middle East.\n\nFor years, the leaders of Hamas's political wing have usually been based outside Gaza or in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, creating a split power structure; from 2007 until the war began last year, Hamas governed Gaza, and its military strength has been concentrated there.\n\nMr. Sinwar's selection to succeed Mr. Haniyeh seems to bridge that divide, but in precarious fashion; it appears unlikely that he could leave Gaza, as the Israeli military continues to hunt for him. In February, Israel's chief military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said, \"The hunt for Sinwar will not stop until we catch him, dead or alive.\"\n\nBorn in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Mr. Sinwar joined Hamas in the 1980s. He was later imprisoned for murdering Palestinians accused of apostasy or collaborating with Israel, spending over two decades in an Israeli prison. He was freed in 2011, along with over 1,000 other Palestinian prisoners, in exchange for a single Israeli soldier held by Hamas.\n\nIn his role as Hamas's leader in Gaza, Mr. Sinwar was in many ways already more internally influential than Mr. Haniyeh, his nominal boss. Mr. Haniyeh served as Hamas's diplomatic face abroad, while Mr. Sinwar controlled operations on the ground and has had close ties with Hamas's military wing, analysts said.\n\nEarlier this week, the Israeli military confirmed that it had killed Muhammad Deif, the elusive commander of Hamas's military wing, in an airstrike on the outskirts of Khan Younis last month.\n\nElevating Mr. Sinwar to leadership of the political operation \"is a symbolic decision that shows that Hamas is with Sinwar's line,\" said Fouad Khuffash, a Palestinian political analyst close to Hamas. \"It is more of an honorific than a practical matter: No one knows where he is, even Hamas.\"\n\nOsama Hamdan, a Hamas spokesman, said in an interview with Al Jazeera that Mr. Sinwar had been chosen unanimously and that he was \"accepted by everyone in the movement.\" He said it was too early to discuss how his selection would affect the cease-fire talks, but suggested that little would change.\n\n\"The negotiations were managed by the leadership, and Sinwar was always present,\" Mr. Hamdan said.\n\nIsrael Katz, the Israeli foreign minister, said in a statement that Mr. Sinwar's appointment was \"yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organization off the face of the earth.\"\n\nMr. Sinwar has not spoken publicly since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel's devastating 10-month campaign in Gaza and led Hezbollah to launch its own attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas.\n\nOn Tuesday, Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a televised addressed that his group and Iran were \"obliged to respond\" to the killings of Mr. Shukr and Mr. Haniyeh, \"whatever the consequences.\"\n\n\"What is required is confrontation,\" Mr. Nasrallah said in a speech commemorating Mr. Shukr, who was killed in Beirut's southern suburbs. \"Our response will come, God willing, and it will be strong.\" He added, \"The wait is part of the punishment.\"\n\nJust minutes before he spoke, fighter jets -- presumably operated by the Israeli military -- ripped through the skies above Beirut, breaking the sound barrier, rattling apartment buildings and sending residents running for cover. Mr. Nasrallah mocked the sonic booms, saying they demonstrated how petty Israel had become.\n\n\"Hezbollah will respond, Iran will respond, Yemen will respond, and the enemy waits,\" he said.\n\nJust hours before Mr. Nasrallah spoke, Hezbollah launched a stream of attack drones into northern Israel in response to an Israeli strike a day earlier that the Israeli military said had killed a Hezbollah field commander.\n\nSeven people in Israel were wounded in the drone attacks, Israeli paramedics said. The Israeli military said some Israeli civilians had also been injured by an Israeli interceptor missile that missed its target.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon killed five people, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry; Israel said it had hit structures used by Hezbollah.\n\nMore than 150,000 people have already been forced from their homes on both sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border since Hezbollah and Israel began striking each other in October. Israeli officials have openly discussed the possibility of invading Lebanon to push Hezbollah away from the border, as it did in 2006, after the war in Gaza concludes.\n\nAbdallah Bou Habib, the Lebanese foreign minister, said on Tuesday that Lebanese officials had sought to discuss an appropriate response with Hezbollah that would not prompt a wider war. But after Mr. Haniyeh was killed in Tehran, infuriating Iranian leaders, the decision was \"bigger than Lebanon,\" he said.\n\n\"We are working so that any response does not bring us to total war,\" Mr. Bou Habib said at a news conference in Egypt. \"That would not benefit any states, nor would it benefit Israel.\"\n\nDiplomats and analysts have warned that a miscalculation by any of the combatants could set off a wider regional war at a particularly tense moment for the Middle East.\n\nIn an effort to contain the tensions, President Biden spoke on Tuesday with Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, and with Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, according to Sean Savett, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council.\n\nMr. Biden discussed efforts to de-escalate regional tensions and to secure a deal to end the fighting in Gaza and to free the remaining hostages seized during the Oct. 7 attack, Mr. Savett said.\n\nEgypt said that Mr. el-Sisi had also spoken to King Abdullah II of Jordan, and that both leaders had emphasized the need for calm and for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nTensions have also been escalating in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have killed at least 12 Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, since Monday, according to the Palestinian Authority's health officials.\n\nThe Israeli military said that its operations in the West Bank, including two airstrikes on the city of Jenin, have been aimed at \"terrorists\" and that several \"wanted suspects\" had been arrested.\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society said Israeli forces had fired on their ambulances in Jenin, just days after one of the group's volunteer paramedics was fatally shot during an Israeli raid in Nablus.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com",

In response, Israel launched a relentless campaign that has so far killed almost 40,000 Palestinians and left the densely populated enclave in ruins.\n\nAttempts at reaching a ceasefire that would give the exhausted population a respite and enable the hostages remaining in captivity to be brought home have foundered amid mutual recriminations from Hamas and Israel.\n\nHamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera that the movement remained committed to reaching a deal and the team that handled the negotiations under Haniyeh would continue under Sinwar, who he said was following the talks closely.\n\nBut Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said Sinwar's appointment to lead the movement overall was a direct challenge to Israel, and sent a message about Hamas' adherence to his \"extremist and resistant approach\".\n\n\"As Sinwar manages the negotiations, he will manage the movement,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "deccanherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@deccanherald.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Arabiya", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Arabiya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Mashal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaled Mashal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Hamdan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Osama Hamdan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://images.deccanherald.com/deccanherald%2F2024-08-06%2Fvw7ca6nj%2F2024newsmlRC2IA9AGBOEG956651875.jpeg?rect=0%2C132%2C3500%2C1838&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 317, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

This transition marks a significant moment for the group as it navigates complex geopolitical tensions.\n\nYahya Sinwar has been at the helm of Hamas operations in the Gaza Strip since 2017, and with his new role, he will also oversee the political wing of the organization. Reports suggest that he is still based in the Gaza Strip; however, his precise location remains undisclosed.\n\nThe announcement of Sinwar's leadership comes amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly in light of Iran's threats of retaliation for Haniyeh's death, which they attribute to Israeli actions.

Israeli security assessments indicate that he played a crucial role in the planning and execution of the attacks on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of over 1,200 individuals and saw 251 people taken as hostages.\n\nNo specific details have been released regarding how Sinwar's leadership of Hamas's political bureau will be structured or function. His public appearances have been notably absent since the attacks, with reports suggesting he may be hiding in secure locations within Gaza.\n\nThe 61-year-old leader has a lengthy history with Hamas, having founded the group's security service, Majd, in the late 1980s, which was responsible for targeting alleged collaborators with Israel. Sinwar has also experienced significant time in Israeli prisons, receiving multiple life sentences following his capture in 1988.

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area. The Palestinian territory faces a severe humanitarian crisis as its Health Ministry says the death toll in the war approaches 40,000.\n\nBEIRUT -- The Palestinian militant group Hamas said Tuesday it has chosen Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, as its new leader.\n\nThe choice of Sinwar, a secretive figure who leads Hamas' hardliners and is close to Iran, was a defiant step. Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent

Only recently, someone -- Israel has not claimed credit -- used a suitable application of high explosives to un-alive a particularly unsavory character, Ismail Haniyeh, who only last week, while staying in a \"guest house\" in Tehran, had his pronouns changed to \"over here,\" and \"over there.\"\n\nNow, Hamas has chosen another unsavory character, Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, to take Haniyeh's place.\n\nHamas named its Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar as successor to former political chief Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week, the group said on Tuesday, in a move that reinforces the radical path pursued since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nSinwar, the architect of the most devastating attack on Israel in decades, has been in hiding in Gaza, defying Israeli attempts to kill him since the start of the war.\n\nDo you know what the thing is about martyrs? They're dead.\n\nSee Related: Iran's Supreme Leader Vows Revenge on Israel After Assassination of Hamas Political Leader Haniyeh\n\nWe Now Know How Israel Was Able to Kill a Hamas Leader in Tehran With Such Precision\n\nSinwar already had a big target on its back, and there are those in the world, say, the people who un-alived Ismail Haniyeh, who will be putting a laser sight on that target now.\n\nHamas, as well as some others in the region, seem to have the idea that Hamas under Sinwar may be willing to negotiate.\n\n\"The appointment means that Israel needs to face Sinwar over a solution to Gaza war,\" said a regional diplomat familiar with the talks brokered by Egypt and Qatar, which are aimed at bringing a halt to the fighting in Gaza and a return of 115 Israeli and foreign hostages still held in the enclave.\n\n\"It is a message of toughness and it is uncompromising.\"\n\nThat's as may be. But this appointment just gave the IDF another reason to come look for this guy in Gaza, and sooner or later, they will.\n\nImagine yourself in the shoes of an Israeli post-Oct 7. One can't blame the Israelis for not being interested in negotiating, other than the use of diplomacy, as I described in another story, of it being the art of saying \"Nice doggy, nice doggy\" until you can find a rock.

His selection on Tuesday as Hamas's top diplomatic leader -- replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran last week -- consolidates his power.\n\nHere's what we know about Mr. Sinwar and his past.\n\nMr. Sinwar was born in Gaza in 1962 to a family that had fled its home, along with several hundred thousand other Palestinian Arabs who fled or were forced to flee during the wars surrounding the creation of the state of Israel. This displacement deeply influenced his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.\n\nMr. Sinwar had been recruited by Hamas's founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who made him chief of an internal security unit known as Al Majd. His job was to find and punish those suspected of violating Islamic morality laws or cooperating with the Israeli occupiers, a position that eventually landed him in trouble with Israeli authorities.\n\nMr. Sinwar was imprisoned in 1988 for murdering four Palestinians whom he accused of apostasy or collaborating with Israel, according to Israeli court records. He spent more than two decades in prison in Israel, where he learned Hebrew and developed an understanding of Israeli culture and society.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Mr. Sinwar took advantage of an online university program and devoured Israeli news. He translated into Arabic tens of thousands of pages of contraband Hebrew-language autobiographies written by the former heads of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet.\n\nYuval Bitton, an Israeli dentist who treated Mr. Sinwar when he was in custody and who developed a relationship with him, said Mr. Sinwar had surreptitiously shared the translated pages so that inmates could study the agency's counterterrorism tactics. Mr. Sinwar liked to call himself a \"specialist in the Jewish people's history,\" Dr. Bitton said.\n\nThe two men spoke regularly. \"The conversations with Sinwar were not personal or emotional,\" Dr. Bitton said. \"They were only about Hamas.\"\n\nMr. Sinwar knew the Quran by heart, and he coolly laid out his organization's governing doctrines, Dr. Bitton said, describing Mr. Sinwar's motivations as religious and not political.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Mr. Sinwar also wrote a novel called \"The Thorn and the Carnation,\" a coming-of-age story that limned his own life: The narrator, a Gazan boy named Ahmed, emerges from hiding during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war to a life under Israeli occupation, which causes the \"chests of youth to boil like a cauldron.\" In retaliation, Ahmed's friends and family attack the occupiers and those who collaborate with the enemy. Woven throughout the book is the theme of the unending sacrifice demanded by the resistance.\n\nMr. Sinwar once told an Italian journalist that prison is a crucible. \"Prison builds you,\" he said, adding that it gave him time to reflect on what he believed in and the price he would be willing to pay for it.\n\nNonetheless, Mr. Sinwar tried to escape from custody several times, once digging a hole in his cell floor in hopes of tunneling under the prison and exiting through the visitor center. And he found ways to plot against Israel with Hamas leaders on the outside, managing to smuggle cellphones into the prison and use lawyers and visitors to ferry messages out, including about finding ways to kidnap Israeli soldiers to trade for Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThese activities foreshadowed the approach Mr. Sinwar would take years later when planning the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nWhen he was released from Israeli prison in a prisoner swap in 2011, Mr. Sinwar said that the capture of Israeli soldiers was, after years of failed negotiations, the proven tactic for freeing Palestinians incarcerated by Israel. \"For the prisoner, capturing an Israeli soldier is the best news in the universe, because he knows that a glimmer of hope has been opened for him,\" Mr. Sinwar said at the time.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Mr. Sinwar married and had children. He has said little in public about his family but once remarked that \"the first words my son spoke were 'father,' 'mother' and 'drone.'\"\n\nHis hard-line stance suggests that he will not be eager to reach a cease-fire agreement with Israel that would end the fighting in Gaza and lead to the return of about 115 hostages, living and dead, taken from Israel who are still being held in Gaza.\n\nIndeed, Israeli and U.S. intelligence officers have said that Mr. Sinwar's strategy is to keep the war in Gaza going for as long as it takes to shred Israel's international reputation and to damage its relationship with its primary ally, the United States.\n\nSince the war began, most cease-fire talks have taken place in Egypt and Qatar. But Mr. Sinwar has still played a principal role, even from his hide-out in Gaza. Throughout the talks, Mr. Sinwar's consent has been required by Hamas's negotiators before they agree to any concessions, according to officials familiar with the talks.\n\nWhile Hamas officials have previously insisted that Mr. Sinwar does not have the final say in the group's decisions, his leadership role in Gaza and his forceful personality have given him outsize importance in how Hamas operates, according to allies and foes alike.\n\n\"There's no decision that can be made without consulting Sinwar,\" said Salah al-Din al-Awawdeh, a Hamas member and political analyst who befriended Mr. Sinwar while they were both jailed in Israel during the 1990s and 2000s. \"Sinwar isn't an ordinary leader. He's a powerful person and an architect of events,\" Mr. al-Awawdeh added.\n\nWaiting for Mr. Sinwar's approval has often slowed cease-fire negotiations. Israeli strikes have damaged much of Gaza's communications infrastructure, and it has sometimes taken a day to get a message to Mr. Sinwar and another day to receive a response.\n\nMr. Sinwar has sometimes disagreed with Hamas leaders outside Gaza and is seen as less ready to concede ground to the Israeli negotiators, in part because he knows that he is likely to be killed whether or not the war ends. The death of his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, in an explosion in Tehran last week, lends credence to this perception, as has Israel's response.\n\n\"The appointment of arch-terrorist Yahya Sinwar as the new leader of Hamas, replacing Ismail Haniyeh, is yet another compelling reason to swiftly eliminate him and wipe this vile organization off the face of the earth,\" Israel Katz, Israel's foreign minister, said in a post on social media on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Reports have also emerged of systematic rights abuses, including the torture of Palestinians in captivity.\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh, likely carried out by Israel, shocked the region and was viewed by many as an attempt by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to thwart efforts to negotiate a ceasefire, in which Haniyeh was a key participant.

His family was displaced from Ashkelon during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a factor that profoundly influenced his militant activities and ideological commitments.\n\nSinwar pursued his education at the Islamic University of Gaza, earning a degree in Arabic studies. His early life in the refugee camp instilled a solid determination to resist Israeli occupation, shaping his future role in Hamas.\n\nHow did Yahya Sinwar rise to prominence within Hamas?\n\nSinwar co-founded Majd, Hamas's security apparatus, in the late 1980s, focusing on identifying and eliminating Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel.\n\nHis terrorist activities led to his arrest in 1988 for orchestrating the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers.\n\nSinwar was sentenced to four life terms but was released in 2011 in a prisoner exchange deal for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nDuring his 22 years in Israeli prisons, Sinwar became known for his steadfastness and leadership among inmates, earning a reputation as a critical figure within Hamas.\n\nWhat are Yahya Sinwar's key leadership roles and achievements?\n\nIn 2017, Sinwar was elected as the leader of Hamas in Gaza, succeeding Ismail Haniyeh. His leadership marked a shift towards a more militant stance, emphasizing military build-up and closer ties with regional powers like Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nSinwar's strategic vision involved enhancing Hamas's military capabilities and preparing for large-scale conflicts with Israel.\n\nHe is widely regarded as the mastermind behind the October 7, 2023, massacre against Israel, which resulted in over 1,200 deaths and the abduction of around 240 hostages.\n\nHow did Yahya Sinwar influence the October 7, 2023, attacks?\n\nSinwar orchestrated the October 7, 2023, attacks, the deadliest in Israeli history. The attacks significantly escalated the Israel-Hamas conflict, positioning Sinwar as a primary target for Israeli retaliation.\n\nHis ability to evade capture by utilizing a complex network of tunnels in Gaza has heightened his notoriety and influence within Hamas.\n\nSinwar's strategic use of hostages as negotiation leverage further underscores his hardline approach.\n\nWhat is Yahya Sinwar's leadership philosophy and vision?\n\nSinwar's leadership is characterized by a hardline approach, prioritizing military resistance over political negotiations.\n\nHe views his role as pivotal in the broader jihad against Israel, often dismissing political solutions that do not align with his vision of Palestinian resistance.\n\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to receive emails from The Jerusalem Post and its partners.\n\nThis field is required\n\nSubmit\n\nSinwar's disdain for political figures like his predecessor Haniyeh, whom he viewed as less committed to the militant cause, reflects his uncompromising stance.\n\nHis strategic vision involves leveraging alliances with regional powers and enhancing Hamas's military capabilities to challenge Israeli forces.\n\nHow has Yahya Sinwar strengthened Hamas's regional alliances?\n\nUnder Sinwar's leadership, Hamas has strengthened its alliances with Iran and Hezbollah, leveraging these relationships to enhance its military capabilities.\n\nThe May 2021 Gaza conflict was a significant turning point for Sinwar, as he perceived it as a demonstration of Hamas's ability to mobilize multiple fronts against Israel.\n\nThis perception has encouraged him to pursue larger-scale operations, believing such actions could significantly alter the regional power dynamics.\n\nWhat challenges does Yahya Sinwar face as the new head of Hamas's political bureau?\n\nFollowing the assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran, Sinwar's position within Hamas was further solidified.\n\nAs the new head of Hamas's political bureau, he faces the dual challenge of maintaining internal cohesion within the organization and addressing intensified Israeli military operations targeting Hamas leadership.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sinwar remains formidable, continuing to shape Hamas's strategies and actions in the ongoing war.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Israel has not publicly taken credit for the death.\n\n\"Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin said on Wednesday that the U.S. government, which has also been mediating the talks along with Qatar and Egypt, would 'work hard to make sure that we're doing things to help take the temperature down, and address issues through diplomatic means,'\" the New York Times reported.\n\nThe U.S. has now sent additional military assets to the region in order to assist Israel's defense ahead of any retaliatory attack, as well as to defend U.S. forces already in the Middle East.\n\nThe newly appointed leader comes after seven U.S. personnel were injured in a rocket attack on Monday at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq.

The choice of the hardliner was a defiant move by Hamas, whose political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 19 people including six soldiers were wounded in northern Israel on Tuesday after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said, as world leaders try to stop tensions in the Middle East from boiling over into a regional war.\n\nMost of the people were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground. Local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice. Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months during the war in Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEfforts continue around the region to prevent the war from becoming a wider conflict after the killings last week of a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon and Hamas' top political leader in Iran. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a \"multi-front war\" with Iran and its proxies.\n\nInside Gaza, the only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter the south has been shut down because of fighting in the area.

Sinwar is at the top of Israel's kill list as it seeks to destroy Hamas and its leadership after the Oct. 7 attack in which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 as hostages.\n\nHamas said in a statement it named Sinwar as the new head of its political bureau to replace Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Iran last week in a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nUnlike Haniyeh, who had lived in exile in Qatar for years, Sinwar has remained in Gaza. As Hamas' leader in the territory since 2017, he rarely appeared in public but kept an iron grip on Hamas' rule. Close to Deif and the armed wing, known as the Qassam Brigades, he worked to build up the group's military capabilities.\n\nSinwar has been in deep hiding since the Oct. 7 attacks, while Israel unleashed its campaign in Gaza and the death toll among Palestinians, now near 40,000, rose.\n\nBiden and Egypt's El-Sisi speak about 'final stage' of negotiations\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes of calming tensions in the Middle East through a cease-fire and hostage release deal.\n\nIn a statement, the White House said negotiations \"have now reached a final stage,\" and that Biden and El-Sisi \"agreed on the urgency of bringing the process to closure as soon as possible.\"\n\nIsraeli airstike on house in central Gaza kills 3, injures 20 others\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA -- Three Palestinian men were killed and 20 other people were injured late Tuesday afternoon after an Israeli airstrike hit a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe chaotic scene at Al-Aqsa hospital where the victims were taken showed an injured man taken out of an ambulance on a stretcher and crowds inside the hospital where one man with apparent severe injuries to the arms and legs laid on a stretcher.\n\nSeveral people could be seen using a blanket to transfer one wounded person. An injured woman and child were also taken inside the hospital.\n\nAmbulances continued to transfer victims of the strike to Al-Aqsa hospital, including one man whose body was almost completely bloodied. Inside the hospital morgue, all three men laid on the floor as their loved ones bid them farewell.\n\nFootage by the Associated Press showed massive destruction where the house was struck with several buildings also being severely damaged.\n\nEgypt working with China to reduce tensions in the Middle East\n\nCAIRO -- Egyptian foreign minister Badr Abdelatty on Tuesday told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over the phone that efforts are being exerted to reduce tensions in the Middle East amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAbdelatty also warned against the risks of an expanded conflict that could destabilize the region and its security, according to a statement released by the Egyptian foreign ministry.\n\nThe Egyptian minister confirmed during his call that Egypt is collaborating with China as well as regional and international leaders to \"stop the bloodshed in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Israel's policy of \"political assassinations and violations of states' sovereignty has worsened the crisis and significantly increased regional tension.\"\n\nPalestinians in Gaza still struggling to get food and clean water\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, GAZA -- Palestinians in Gaza are still struggling to secure food and clean water for their families as Israel continues to restrict the entry of life-saving aid.\n\nChildren in Khan Younis have to line up for a long time to get food at charity kitchens and fill up 10 liters (2.6 gallons) of water in plastic containers -- hardly enough for large families. Water has become severely scarce in Gaza after water wells across the enclave were destroyed in Israeli airstrikes.\n\n\"Life here is unbearable,\" Ghalia Hamouda, a woman displaced from Beit Lahiya, told The Associated Press. \"There is no water. We don't have charity kitchens. Our children have been sick all day ... and stomach cramps never go away.\"\n\nA woman from a displaced family cooked white beans in thin tomato sauce over a basic stove as seven relatives gathered around to eat two plates of the beans with pieces of bread.\n\n\"My son is young. He runs a distance of around 2 kilometers to reach a charity kitchen to get food and sometimes he comes back with only his tears and he's empty-handed because he couldn't get his turn in line to get food,\" Rafat Abed Al-Dayem said.\n\nAl-Dayem said his family gets around 20 liters to 40 liters (5.3 to 10.5 gallons) of \"not drinkable\" water: \"We only drink it because we are thirsty.\"\n\nLast month, UN experts declared that famine has spread throughout the Gaza Strip as they reported cases of malnutrition and dehydration.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We're deprived from everything, including aid which we don't see. Where is the humanitarian aid?\" said Rahaf Al-Refi, a woman displaced from Gaza City.\n\nHezbollah vows to retaliate against Israel for Beirut airstrike\n\nBEIRUT -- The leader of Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group vowed to retaliate against Israel for its recent airstrike in Beirut that killed a top commander, \"no matter what the consequences are.\"\n\nHassan Nasrallah said Hezbollah could either act unilaterally or in unity with its allies in the so-called \"axis of resistance\" that includes Iran and its proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.\n\nTension has been rising in the Middle East since last week's attacks in which a top military commander Fouad Shukur was killed in Beirut and a Hamas political leader was killed in Iran.\n\nIsrael said it killed Shukur but did not claim or deny the rocket attack that killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was visiting Tehran.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The Israelis chose escalation by carrying out assassinations,\" Nasrallah said. He said Hezbollah will not be silent regarding the Beirut airstrike.\n\nHe added that Israel has been on high alert since last week while waiting for Hezbollah's retaliation, adding that making them wait \"is part of the punishment.\"\n\nShortly before Nasrallah gave his speech, Israeli warplanes flew over Beirut twice Tuesday afternoon, shaking buildings and increasing anxiety among the capital's residents. It came two days after the Lebanese marked the fourth anniversary of the massive port blast in Beirut that killed more than 200 people, wounded thousands and caused wide destruction.\n\nAt least 19 hurt in northern Israel after Hezbollah launches drone strikes\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- At least 19 people including six soldiers have been wounded in northern Israel after Lebanon's Hezbollah militants launched drone attacks, emergency officials said. Most were hurt by an Israeli interceptor rocket that missed and hit the ground.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut last week, which has raised fears of an all-out war. Still, local authorities issued sweeping new guidelines in northern Israel for all residents to \"avoid all non-vital activity and to stay near a safe area\" until further notice.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTuesday's strikes appeared to be part of the near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanon border. Hezbollah says its rocket and drone barrages since the start of the war in Gaza are an act of solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli airstrike earlier Tuesday killed four people in southern Lebanon, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nHezbollah's drones targeted sites near the coastal town of Nahariya, the military said. It said an interceptor missed its target in one case, falling and injuring a number of people. The Nahariya Medical Center said 12 people were hurt in that incident, including one seriously. Seven others were injured in another drone strike, the center said.\n\nHezbollah said it targeted Israeli army bases after an Israeli strike Monday killed a lower-level commander in southern Lebanon.\n\nUltra-Orthodox protesters enter Israeli military base, objecting to draft order\n\nJERUSALEM -- Ultra-Orthodox protesters have jumped barriers and broken through fences to storm an Israeli military recruitment base in another demonstration against their impending enlistment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA landmark Supreme Court order said young religious men must begin enlisting for military service. Under long-standing political arrangements, ultra-Orthodox men had been exempt from the draft that is compulsory for most Jewish men.\n\nIn videos aired on Hebrew media, at least a dozen men could be seen wandering through the woods at the base. Others could be seen scuffling with police on horseback. Israeli police said 21 people were arrested and three policemen were injured. The military condemned the violent behavior and called the enlistment of ultra-Orthodox \"an operational necessity.\"\n\nHezbollah launches drone attack in northern Israel, wounding at least 7\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel -- Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a drone attack Tuesday on northern Israel, wounding at least seven people, in response to the killing of one of its fighters in an Israeli airstrike.\n\nThe attack did not appear to be linked to Hezbollah's vow to avenge the killing of one of its top commanders in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut the previous week, which has raised fears of an all-out war.\n\nHezbollah has launched near-daily drone and rocket attacks since the start of the Gaza war in what it says is an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has responded with airstrikes, one of which killed four people in southern Lebanon earlier Tuesday, according to Lebanese authorities.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHezbollah said it launched a drone attack targeting army bases in northern Israel in retaliation for the killing of a lower-level commander in a strike late Monday.\n\nGal Zaid, spokesperson for Galilee Medical Center, said it was treating one severely wounded person and four others with mild injuries. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it was treating seven wounded in three locations in Western Galilee.\n\nThe Israeli military said \"a number\" of drones entered from Lebanon, one of which was intercepted. It said several civilians were wounded near the coastal town of Nahariya, some 6 kilometers (4 miles) south of the border, without giving a precise number.\n\nThe only humanitarian air corridor into southern Gaza is shut down\n\nJERUSALEM -- The only corridor for humanitarian aid to enter southern Gaza has been shut down, apparently because of fighting in the area.\n\nThe Israeli military said the humanitarian route leading from the crossing into the city of Rafah was closed Tuesday until further notice after anti-tank missiles were fired at troops and multiple soldiers were wounded. It said the Kerem Shalom crossing was open.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHamas' armed wing said it attacked an Israeli tank in the area. It is not possible to confirm battlefield reports in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinian territory has been plunged into a severe humanitarian crisis in the war ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. The vast majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been displaced by the fighting, often multiple times, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded, squalid tent camps. International experts said in June that Gaza was at \"high risk\" of famine.\n\nAid groups say efforts to bring in desperately needed food and supplies have been hindered by Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.\n\nAn Israeli strike on a village in south Lebanon kills 4, Health Ministry says\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's Health Ministry says an Israeli airstrike on a village in the country's south killed four people. The ministry said Tuesday's airstrike targeted a home in the village of Maifadoun near the market town of Nabatiye.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the dead were civilians or militants.\n\nSince early October, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a backup front for their Palestinian allies in the Gaza Strip. Since then, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon, including around 90 civilians. On the Israeli side, 22 soldiers and 24 civilians have been killed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAn Israeli officer is stabbed on the outskirts of Jerusalem, Israeli police say\n\nJERUSALEM -- Israeli police say a stabbing at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Jerusalem lightly wounded one Border Police officer.\n\nPolice said that the attack occurred after Israeli officers at the checkpoint asked passengers to disembark from a bus for what it called a \"routine check.\" One of the passengers then stabbed a Border Police officer with a screwdriver.\n\nMilitary Police immediately shot and killed the attacker, police said without identifying the assailant. Israel's rescue services said the 20-year-old female officer wounded in the attack was fully conscious and was being transferred to the hospital.\n\nViolence has surged in the occupied West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. More than 600 Palestinians have been killed, mostly in military raids, gun battles between the army and militants, and violent protests. Palestinians have carried out a number of attacks against Israelis, including stabbings at checkpoints.\n\n10 Palestinians are killed and 10 wounded in Israeli raids in the West Bank\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank -- Palestinian officials say 10 Palestinians were killed, including four teenagers, and another 10 were wounded by Israeli fire during military raids and operations across the north of the occupied West Bank.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry said Tuesday that four people, including two 19-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were killed in an overnight raid in the village of Aqaaba in the northern West Bank. It said another four people, including an 18-year-old, were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in Jenin -- a frequent flashpoint -- where the Islamic Jihad militant group said its fighters were battling the army.\n\nMeanwhile two more Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the village of Kafr Qud, near Jenin, later Tuesday, the ministry said.\n\nIsrael's military said it \"eliminated four terrorists\" with an airstrike in the Jenin area and that it and border police \"eliminated\" seven others it said threw explosive devices at security forces or tried to plant explosives. It said a soldier was injured during the operation.\n\nIsrael has carried out near-daily military raids across the West Bank since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Palestinians from the West Bank have carried out a number of attacks on Israelis. The Health Ministry says over 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in the West Bank since the start of the war. Most were killed during military arrest raids and violent protests.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited control over population centers. Over 500,000 Jewish settlers, who live in scores of settlements across the territory that most of the international community views as illegal or illegitimate, have Israeli citizenship.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAustralia's prime minister condemns Iranian ambassador's comments on social media as 'abhorrent'\n\nSYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday condemned as \"abhorrent\" an Iranian ambassador's social media comment on Israel.\n\nAlbanese said ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi had been called in for a meeting with Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials over his recent post on the social media platform X.\n\nSadeghi cites Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin advocating that \"wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027.\" Sadeghi added: \"Looking forward to such a heavenly & divine promise Inshaa-Allah.\" The Arabic expression means \"if God wills.\"\n\nAlbanese told reporters: \"I make it clear: There's no place for the sort of comments that were made online on social media by the Iranian ambassador.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"They're abhorrent. And they are hateful, they are antisemitic and they have no place,\" Albanese added.\n\nAsked by a reporters if the ambassador should be expelled from Australia, Albanese did not directly answer.\n\nThe Iranian Embassy in Australia later told The Associated Press in an email that Sadeghi's post \"has nothing to do with Jewish People, anti-Semitism or raising hate speech or violent ways.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thestar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Despite that, he is thought to have been dictating the group's position in the cease-fire talks.\n\nHis selection to lead the group's political office comes as the Middle East braces for Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, to strike Israel in response to the killings last week of Mr. Haniyeh and a senior Hezbollah commander, Fuad Shukr.\n\nHamas and Iran have blamed Israel for planting the bomb that killed Mr. Haniyeh in the Iranian capital, Tehran, after he attended the inauguration of the country's new president. Israel has declined to comment on Mr. Haniyeh's death, but U.S. officials have privately assessed that Israel was behind it.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/multimedia/06mideast-crisis-sinwar-photo-plwh/06mideast-crisis-sinwar-photo-plwh-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 193, "textEnd": 199}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The appointment sends a clear signal that Hamas's most extreme faction is now in charge of the entire movement which is now increasingly co-ordinated with Iran, dimming hopes of a ceasefire that might end a war that has already claimed nearly 40,000 lives.\n\nOfficials from Hamas had gathered in the Qatari capital of Doha in recent days for the funeral of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of its political bureau who was assassinated in Tehran on July 30th, and closed-door discussions over who would take his job. Though Mr Sinwar has become the dominant figure in the group since the attacks on southern Israel, he had not been expected to accede to the top position himself.\n\nSeveral of the group's political leaders in Doha had been pushing hard to appoint Khaled Meshaal or another figure who might have counterbalanced Mr Sinwar's internal authority. Since being elected as head of the Gaza political bureau, one of the three regional bureaus, in 2017 Mr Sinwar has centralised power and marginalised political rivals within the movement. In theory his presence in Gaza should have disqualified him from leading the entire organisation: the group's internal bylaws stipulate that the overall head of the political bureau should be located outside Gaza. Yet in the end the group's political leaders backed Mr Sinwar unanimously, say sources within Hamas.\n\nThe appointment is technically only a temporary one until an internal election can be held next year. Yet with the war in Gaza still raging, many Hamas leaders believe the poll will not take place as planned, which would leave Mr Sinwar unchallenged for some time. It means Hamas is becoming more of an underground guerilla movement with a leader hiding in a tunnel beneath Gaza, instead of shuttling between the capitals of the region. In recent months, the Qataris threatened Hamas's leaders with eviction from Doha unless they show more flexibility in the ceasefire talks. Such a threat will have less of an effect on Mr Sinwar.\n\nIn messages passed via couriers from Gaza, Mr Sinwar had insisted that the new leader would need to be on good terms with both Iran and Syria -- two of Hamas's key backers. \"Sinwar got much closer to Iran than anyone else in the movement in the past few years,\" says Azzam Tamimi, a writer with close links to Hamas's leadership. This essentially amounted to a veto on the appointment of Mr Meshaal.\n\nYet Hamas has long had an uneasy relationship with Iran. The Islamic republic was its main state sponsor, a regular source of arms and money. But a Sunni Islamist group and a revolutionary Shia regime made for uneasy bedfellows. When Syria slid into civil war in 2011, Iran propped up Bashar al-Assad's regime, while Hamas sided with his mostly Sunni opposition. Mr Meshaal, who was the leader of Hamas at the time, closed the group's headquarters in Damascus in 2012. He spent the next few years trying to cultivate ties with the Sunni Arab powers: in 2015, for example, he made a rare visit to Saudi Arabia to meet King Salman. Some Hamas leaders backed his effort, hoping the Gulf would provide them with investment and political legitimacy. Others preferred to patch up their relations with Iran.\n\nIn 2017, Mr Meshaal spearheaded efforts to revise the group's charter to a document that softened its stance on Israel and appeared to nudge Hamas towards accepting a two state solution. Yet Mr Sinwar did all he could to undermine Mr Meshaal's reforms, a move that fuelled great personal enmity between the two.\n\nHad Mr Meshaal been named the group's new leader -- an appointment that Turkey and Qatar had been pushing for -- it would have been a blow to the pro-Iranian faction within Hamas. The choice of Mr Sinwar means that Gulf states will keep their distance from the group: they view him as a dangerous ideologue aligned with their main regional foe. Moreover, Mr Sinwar's appointment will further marginalise the group's external political leaders, who are generally seen as more moderate and interested in diplomacy than Mr Sinwar is.\n\nIf there is indeed a part of Hamas that is interested in diplomacy, then it has been weakened by this move: whereas Mr Haniyeh had been pushing for a ceasefire with Israel, Mr Sinwar has instead tried to prolong the conflict. With Mr Sinwar cementing his control of both Gaza and Hamas's political bureau, the chances of a ceasefire and the release of hostages look more remote. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com",

All international attempts at persuading Hizbullah not to retaliate were futile, he said.\n\n\"Whatever the consequences, the resistance will not let these Israeli attacks pass by,\" he said in a televised address to mark one week since the assassination of the commander, Fuad Shukr, in Beirut.\n\n\"Our response, God willing, will be strong, effective and impactful.\"\n\nMembers and supporters of Hizbullah gathered to watch the speech in a southern suburb of Beirut. Just before his speech began, Israeli warplanes swooped low over the Lebanese capital, setting off a series of sonic booms that rattled windows across the city. There was no comment from the Israeli military.\n\nConcern is rising that the Middle East could tip into full-blown war following Hizbullah's vows to avenge Shukr's killing, and Iran's anger over the assassination in Tehran last week of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\n[ Yahya Sinwar: The October 7th architect who is playing a key role in ceasefire negotiationsOpens in new window ]\n\nThe strike that killed Shukr on July 30th was the second time Israel had struck the southern suburbs in 10 months of hostilities between Hizbullah and Israel that are taking place in parallel with the war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nHizbullah earlier on Tuesday said it had launched a swarm of attack drones at two military sites near Acre in northern Israel and attacked an Israeli military vehicle at another location.\n\nThe Israeli military said a number of hostile drones were identified crossing from Lebanon, and one was intercepted.\n\nIsraeli medical officials said seven people with injuries were evacuated to hospital to the south of the coastal city of Nahariya, one in critical condition.\n\nThe Israeli military said an initial investigation indicated the injuries were caused by an interceptor that \"missed the target and hit the ground, injuring several civilians\".\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, four Hizbullah fighters were killed in a strike on a home in the Lebanese town of Mayfadoun, nearly 30km north of the border, medics and a security source said.\n\nIn Gaza, Israeli forces killed 45 Palestinian fighters over the past day, the Israeli military said on Tuesday, after heavy fighting in which Hamas said it destroyed two armoured personnel carriers during an ambush near the city of Rafah.\n\nThe Israeli military said the Hamas official in charge of smuggling operations was among those killed and that his death significantly hit the group's ability to bring weapons and military equipment into the besieged enclave.\n\nOn Tuesday, air strikes killed five Palestinians in the Al-Bureij camp, in the central Gaza Strip, medics said, while two others were killed in a separate air strike in Rafah, near the southern Gaza border with Egypt.\n\n[ Senior Hamas official says group will disarm if sovereign Palestinian state is establishedOpens in new window ]\n\nHamas does not provide casualty numbers for its fighters.\n\nThe Islamist movement's armed wing said its fighters destroyed the two Israeli troop carriers in an ambush east of Rafah. There was no confirmation from the Israeli military.\n\nGaza's health ministry said Israeli strikes had killed at least 30 Palestinians and wounded 66 others in the past 24 hours.\n\nIn the West Bank, Israeli forces killed at least eight people on Tuesday and overnight.\n\nHamas-led fighters set off the Gaza war last year, when they rampaged through Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip in a surprise attack, killing about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and seizing some 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies, in the most deadly single-day attack on Israel in its history.\n\nIn response, Israel has conducted a relentless assault on Gaza that has reduced much of the heavily populated coastal strip to ruins and killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities.

(Reuters)\n\nIn choosing its next leader, Hamas will be looking for a candidate who can safeguard deep ties with Tehran at a time when Iranian support will be more important than ever to help the Palestinian group recover after the Gaza war, analysts say.\n\nThe militant Sunni Islamist group has several potential replacements for Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week. They include former leader, Khaled Meshaal, who led Hamas for 13 years from outside the Palestinian territories until passing the baton to Haniyeh in 2017.\n\nBut experts believe his chances could be hurt by past friction with Shia Islamist Iran and its regional allies, notably Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Meshaal was Hamas leader when the group turned on Damascus during the Arab Spring and declared sympathy with the Sunni-led rebellion against him.\n\nIran's support will be doubly important to Hamas as it seeks to rebuild once the guns fall silent in Gaza, devastated by Israeli bombardment since the group ignited war by attacking Israel on October 7. While Hamas continues to fight in Gaza, 10 months of pummelling by Israel have hit it hard.\n\nThis consideration seems likely to boost the prospects of candidates deemed closer to Tehran, including Khalil al-Hayya, currently serving as Hamas' deputy leader for Gaza though he left the territory some years ago.\n\n\"There might have been some retreat in Meshaal's chances of taking the place of Haniyeh, because he doesn't enjoy much support from Iran since he was the one who turned against the Syrian regime and ended the Hamas presence in Damascus,\" said Ashraf Abouelhoul, a specialist on Palestinian issues and managing editor of the Egyptian state-owned paper Al-Ahram.\n\n\"Also the armed wing, which is keen on the concept of the rebuilding when the war is over, will be thinking of a candidate whose relations with Iran are strong enough to ensure the rebuilding takes place,\" he said.\n\nOne Hamas official told Reuters the succession hadn't been settled yet and the deliberations are under way.\n\nHayya was known to be very close to Haniyeh. He accompanied him to Tehran for the visit during which he was killed in July.\n\nHe led Hamas' negotiating team for ceasefire talks under Haniyeh's supervision and also led reconciliation talks with Hamas' Palestinian rival Fatah in past years.\n\nLike Haniyeh, he maintained strong relations with Iran and in 2022 he led a Hamas delegation to Damascus to mend ties with Assad, declaring it a historic meeting.\n\nSpeaking as Hamas received condolences for Haniyeh's death in Qatar, Hayya said the movement's leadership remained united.\n\n\"Our will is strong and can't be broken by the martyrdom of one leader or two or three,\" he said. \"God willing within days we will conclude our consultations to choose a new leader.\" Hani al-Masri, a Palestinian political analyst, said that in less extraordinary times the group's Gaza leader, Yahya Sinwar, would have been a candidate.\n\nSinwar was a mastermind of the October 7 attack, in which gunmen killed 1,200 people and abducted another 250, according to Israeli tallies, prompting the Israeli offensive which the Gaza health ministry says has killed 40,000 people.\n\nSinwar is widely believed to still be running Hamas' war from tunnels under Gaza. Hayya's chances are helped by his good ties to the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, the region's most powerful Iran-aligned faction, which has been trading fire with Israel throughout the Gaza war.\n\nMasri noted Meshaal's leadership qualities and experience but said his prospects hinged on healing the rift with Iran: \"His weak point is his negative relationships with Iran, Syria and Hezbollah at a time when there is ... a joint war.\"", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His selection on Tuesday as Hamas's top diplomatic leader -- replacing Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Iran last week -- consolidates his power.\n\nHere's what we know about Mr. Sinwar and his past.\n\nFormative years\n\nMr. Sinwar was born in Gaza in 1962 to a family that had fled its home, along with several hundred thousand other Palestinian Arabs who fled or were forced to flee during the wars surrounding the creation of the state of Israel. This displacement deeply influenced his decision to join Hamas in the 1980s.\n\nMr. Sinwar had been recruited by Hamas's founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who made him chief of an internal security unit known as Al Majd. His job was to find and punish those suspected of violating Islamic morality laws or cooperating with the Israeli occupiers, a position that eventually landed him in trouble with Israeli authorities.\n\nA crucible\n\nMr. Sinwar was imprisoned in 1988 for murdering four Palestinians whom he accused of apostasy or collaborating with Israel, according to Israeli court records. He spent more than two decades in prison in Israel, where he learned Hebrew and developed an understanding of Israeli culture and society.\n\nWhile incarcerated, Mr. Sinwar took advantage of an online university program and devoured Israeli news. He translated into Arabic tens of thousands of pages of contraband Hebrew-language autobiographies written by the former heads of Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet.\n\nYuval Bitton, an Israeli dentist who treated Mr. Sinwar when he was in custody and who developed a relationship with him, said Mr. Sinwar had surreptitiously shared the translated pages so that inmates could study the agency's counterterrorism tactics. Mr. Sinwar liked to call himself a \"specialist in the Jewish people's history,\" Dr. Bitton said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Culture of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apostasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/multimedia/06mideast-crisis-sinwar-bio01-pltq/06mideast-crisis-sinwar-bio01-pltq-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 46, "textEnd": 52, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In his tweet, Netanyahu acknowledged Sinwar's house \"is not his castle, and he can flee, but it is only a matter of time until we find him.\" Israeli officials said at the time the IDF has killed roughly half of Hamas' mid-level commanders in Gaza, and just last week, the IDF said it had killed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades, in a July airstrike in Gaza.\n\nFighting Resumes In Gaza As Israel Carries Out Air Strikes After Accusing Hamas Of Ceasefire Violation (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health,_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health, Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Deif", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Deif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/65736142d4be452d02b2e689/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=4500,2531,x0,y175,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 230, "textEnd": 236, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

political bureau chief 'surprising': Israeli media", "body": "- Hezbollah also praises selection, emphasizing it as a sign of Hamas's unwavering principles and failure of Israeli assassination policies\n\nJERUSALEM\n\nThe appointment of Yahya Sinwar as the head of the Palestinian resistance group Hamas's political bureau is both a surprise and a message to Israel that he is alive, the official Israeli Broadcasting Authority, KAN, said late Tuesday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hamas announced that Sinwar, 61, would succeed Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated last week by a strike on his residence during a visit to the Iranian capital, Tehran.\n\nWhile Iran and Hamas accused Tel Aviv of Haniyeh's assassination, Israel has remained silent, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hinted at Israeli involvement.\n\nRoi Kais, the Arab affairs correspondent for KAN News, said in the evening news program that \"in reality, this (Sinwar's selection) is a surprise just a week after Haniyeh's assassination.\"\n\nKais believes Sinwar's appointment sends \"a message from Hamas that he is alive, despite being hunted by Israel, and that Hamas's leadership in Gaza remains strong and intends to stay in power.\"\n\nEhud Yaari, the Middle East affairs analyst for Channel 12, noted that Sinwar's appointment has symbolic significance in affirming his position within the movement.\n\nHowever, he argued that \"it has no practical significance at this stage, as Sinwar faces difficulties in communicating with the rest of the leadership,\" in his view.\n\nLebanon's Hezbollah group, in a statement, considered Sinwar's selection \"a strong message to the Zionist enemy and the US that Hamas is united in its decision.\"\n\nThe statement added that this appointment \"confirms that the enemy's goals of killing leaders and officials have failed to achieve their objectives.\"\n\nHamas leader Osama Hamdan said in a recorded message that Sinwar's appointment to lead Hamas's political bureau \"reaffirms the unity of the movement and its awareness of the dangers it faces.\"\n\nHe said the decision also demonstrates that \"Israeli assassination policies will not succeed in breaking the resistance.\"\n\nBefore his latest appointment, Sinwar was elected as the leader of the movement in Gaza in 2017 and re-elected in 2021.\n\nSinwar is the most wanted Hamas leader by Israel, with Tel Aviv accusing him of masterminding the group's Oct. 7 cross-border attack last year which prompted Israel to launch a devastating military campaign in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 39,600 people, according to local health authorities.\n\nTen months into the Israeli war, vast tracts of Gaza lie in ruins amid a crippling blockade of food, clean water and medicine.\n\nIsrael stands accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice, which ordered it to immediately halt its military operation in the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million Palestinians had sought refuge from the war before it was invaded on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The militant Sunni Islamist group has several potential replacements for Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated in Tehran last week. They include former leader, Khaled Meshaal, who led Hamas for 13 years from outside the Palestinian territories until passing the baton to Haniyeh in 2017.\n\nBut experts believe his chances could be hurt by past friction with Shi'ite Islamist Iran and its regional allies, notably Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

Based in Qatar, he had played a key role in internationally brokered talks on reaching a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nA U.S.-designated terrorist, Haniyeh was considered a relative moderate within the organization.\n\nHamas's military wing is led by Yahya Sinwar, the leader based in Gaza who is considered the mastermind of the group's attack inside Israeli territory on October 7 that killed more than 1,200 people and sparked Israel's retaliatory invasion of the Palestinian enclave later that month.\n\nHaniyeh, who was born in a Palestinian refugee camp, died at the age of 62. No state or organization has claimed responsibility for his killing, although Tehran has blamed Israel and vowed revenge. While Israel has not commented on the incident, Haniyeh had been high on Israel's hit list since the October attack.\n\nMore than 39,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials in the territory, as international calls for a cease-fire have gone unanswered.\n\nHaniyeh, who would have been a top voice in any peace negotiations, was in Tehran to attend the inauguration of Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian, who was sworn in on July 30. The two leaders were pictured together during the visit in photographs released by Pezeshkian's office.\n\nHaniyeh was born in the Al-Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City. His family is originally from an area that is now the Israeli port of Ashkelon, north of the Gaza Strip. The family fled the area during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and moved to Gaza.\n\nHaniyeh joined Hamas as a university student shortly after it was founded in 1987 after the beginning of the First Intifada, which protested Israel's occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.\n\nThat year, Haniyeh was arrested and briefly jailed for participating in anti-Israel protests. He also graduated in 1987 with a degree in Arabic literature from the Islamic University of Gaza.\n\nIn 1988, Haniyeh was arrested again and jailed for six months, and in 1989 he was sentenced to three years in prison due to his involvement with Hamas.\n\nAfter his release in 1992, Haniyeh was among hundreds of Hamas members and supporters who were exiled to southern Lebanon. Haniyeh spent a year at the Marj al-Zahour camp before returning to Gaza to become a dean at his alma mater, the Islamic University of Gaza.\n\nWhen Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin was released from an Israeli prison in 1997, Haniyeh was tapped to head his office and the two developed a close relationship. Haniyeh's prominence within Hamas rose quickly and he was selected to represent the group in the Palestinian Authority, which runs part of the West Bank.\n\nHaniyeh and Yassin narrowly escaped an Israeli air strike in September 2003 that targeted their residence in Gaza City. Yassin was killed six months later by an Israeli air strike.\n\nIn the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections, Haniyeh headed the list of Hamas candidates.\n\nUnder the slogan \"change and reform,\" 76 out of 132 parliamentary seats went to Hamas.\n\nWith a majority secured, newly nominated Prime Minister Haniyeh set about forming a government.\n\nSeveral weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government between Hamas, its main rival Fatah, and other Palestinian groups failed -- largely due to Hamas's refusal to accept conditions set out by the United States, Russia, United Nations, and European Union, which included recognition of the state of Israel.\n\nShortly after its landslide victory, Hamas said it would not back down from its goal of replacing Israel with an Islamic state and indicated that it would resist negotiations to resolve the long-standing conflict with Israel.\n\nHaniyeh eventually formed a government made up mostly of Hamas members and technocrats.\n\nIn presenting his government's plan, Haniyeh also called on the United States and Europe to not carry out their threats to halt aid to the Hamas-led government unless it recognized Israel, renounced violence, and abided by agreements under previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements aimed at a two-state solution.\n\nHaniyeh said that he considered the continuation of the Palestinians' struggle for independence to be a \"legitimate right.\" He also expressed openness to engage in talks with international negotiators to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"Our government will spare no effort to achieve a just peace in the region, end the occupation, and restore our rights,\" he said, although Hamas remained steadfast in its refusal to recognize the state of Israel.\n\nIn June 2007, open violence broke out between Hamas and Fatah, and Hamas took full control of the Gaza Strip. Shortly afterward, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led government.\n\nThe internal conflicts among the Palestinian groups led to the de facto division of control of the Palestinian territories, with the West Bank controlled by the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas in control of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsrael, which had pulled its forces out of the Gaza strip two years earlier, imposed a land, sea, and air blockade on the Hamas-controlled territory that is still in effect.\n\nIn 2011, the United States requested that Qatar provide a headquarters for Hamas's political leadership to facilitate communications. Haniyeh moved to Doha in 2016 and the next year replaced Khaled Mashal as the head of Hamas's political office.\n\nThe U.S. State Department added Haniyeh to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, a classification Washington said targeted terrorist groups and leaders who threaten the stability of the Middle East.\n\nThe State Department noted that Hamas had been designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997 and added to the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2001.\n\nIn extending the terrorist designation to Haniyeh himself, the State Department explained: \"Haniyeh has close links with Hamas' military wing and has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians. He has reportedly been involved in terrorist attacks against Israeli citizens. Hamas has been responsible for an estimated 17 American lives killed in terrorist attacks.\"\n\nFollowing the deadly surprise attack by Hamas on Israeli cities and towns on October 7, Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders appeared in a video in which they thanked God for the attack's success.\n\nThree of Haniyeh's sons -- Hazem, Amir, and Haniyeh -- have reportedly been killed by Israeli air strikes against the Gaza Strip since the Israel-Hamas war began.\n\nHaniyeh is survived by his wife and cousin, Amal Haniyeh, with whom he had 13 children, including eight sons and five daughters.", "source":

His death leaves a significant gap in Hamas' leadership.\n\nThe assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran dominated the headlines on Wednesday. Many media reports focused on Haniyeh's reputation as a moderate figure in Hamas and accepted claims from Iran and Hamas that Israel was behind the attack.\n\nFor more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org\n\nAccording to a statement by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Saudi Arabia's Al Arabiya news, Haniyeh was killed at approximately 2 am Wednesday, just hours after Hezbollah's top military commander, Fuad Shukr, was killed by an Israeli strike in Beirut. Both assassinations threaten to escalate regional tensions.\n\nShukr was the commander behind the Majdal Shams attack last week that killed 12 children. He was also wanted by the US because of his role in planning and executing the 1983 Beirut barracks attack that killed 307 people, including 241 US soldiers.\n\nWhile Israel claimed responsibility for the strike on Shukr, it has not commented on Haniyeh's killing.\n\nBorn in 1962 in the Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza, Haniyeh was a prominent Palestinian political leader. He rose through the ranks of Hamas to become one of the group's most influential leaders.\n\nThe death of Haniyeh, who was considered a moderate voice within Hamas, complicates the already tense regional dynamics and leaves a significant gap in Hamas' leadership. Hamas and Iran have both blamed Israel for the assassination and vowed to retaliate.\n\nOther than Iran and Hamas, only China, Lebanon, Qatar, Turkey, and Jordan have formally accused Israel of killing Haniyeh. But most American and British news sources seem to accept that Israel was behind the attack.\n\nMedia reacts\n\nA BBC article on the killing called Haniyeh \"moderate and pragmatic\" and did not describe him as a terrorist. The British channel Sky News also described him as a \"moderate leader.\" A casual news consumer might not realize that Haniyeh was sanctioned by the US and wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe New York Times headline on Haniyeh's assassination read, \"Ismail Haniyeh, a Top Hamas Leader, Is Dead at 62.\" The article described Haniyeh as a \"Hamas top negotiator in cease-fire talks to end the nearly 10-month-old war in Gaza,\" and did not mention his role in starting the war.\n\nMany news outlets focused on the potential response from Hamas and Iran. The main headline on the NPR website read, \"Hamas accuses Israel of killing its top political leader while he was in Tehran.\" The main Reuters headline was \"Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran, stoking fears of wider Middle East war.\"\n\nIn a CNN article titled \"Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh killed in Iran,\" the news site included a section about open questions regarding the assassination, such as which type of aircraft was used in the strike. Israel's role in the killing was not listed as an open question.\n\nThe conservative channel Fox News headline on the subject read, \"Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh reportedly assassinated -- Israel was immediately blamed for the assassination.\" The channel suggested that Israel was most likely behind the attack, noting that Israel does not make public comments on assassinations carried out by its Mossad intelligence agency.\n\nSimilarly, in the Washington Post article \"Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh assassinated; Iran vows revenge,\" the newspaper said that Israel was adopting a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" by not commenting on the assassination.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Haniyeh was the chief Palestinian negotiator in indirect months-long ceasefire talks with the Israeli delegation, among them Mossad Chief David Barnea, whose organization reportedly executed the shocking kill operation.\n\nThis targeting of the head of the political movement reflects Israel's systematic policy of assassinating leaders who can unify ranks and deepen relations with regional and international powers. This also explains the reasoning behind Israel's 2 January assassination of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut, the key Hamas figure managing relations between Tehran, Ankara, Lebanon, and Doha.\n\nHaniyeh, too, was distinguished not only by his ability to bridge the vision gap between Hamas' military and political wings but also by successfully liaising with various regional and international powers and playing a major role advancing the interests of the resistance group in its three target regions - Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and abroad.\n\nHaniyeh's assassination has created an urgent need to reorganize Hamas' internal house - particularly urgent given Israel's ongoing genocidal war on Gaza - and reconcile the disparate views of its leaders, such as Yahya Sinwar in Gaza and Khaled Meshaal abroad.\n\nToday, nothing would suit Israel more than seeing Meshaal, in particular, regain the reins at Hamas. The former Hamas politburo chief, after all, controversially split up Tel Aviv's biggest regional adversaries - the Resistance Axis - at the start of the Syrian war by turning his back on the only Arab state member of the Axis, Syria.\n\nIt has taken Hamas years to fully reintegrate into the Axis after that betrayal, which is often blamed on Meshaal and his cohorts who decamped from Damascus to Doha. It was only through tireless efforts by leaders like Haniyeh and Arouri that Hamas' relations with the regional resistance were publicly mended.\n\nMeshaal has since suffered the indignity of being spurned by Syrian, Iranian, and Hezbollah leaders, so his return to the top would be manna to Israeli ears - even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had, almost successfully, undertaken to kill Meshaal in 1997.\n\nThose were different times, though, and alliances and interests in the region have shifted many times since. Today, it is the unifying, pro-resistance qualities of leaders like Haniyeh and Arouri that pose a far bigger threat to Israel.\n\nRising role\n\nHaniyeh was, by consensus, a popular Hamas leader able to straddle the breadth of the Palestinian political community, and led an exceptional career that began with the establishment of the Hamas movement in the 1970s.\n\nHe was born in 1964 in the Shati refugee camp, where he lived, breathed, and experienced the suffering of Palestinian refugees in all its painful details. Haniyeh joined Hamas early under the guidance of the charismatic founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. His memorization of the Quran before the age of 14 made him an eloquent preacher - he had a beautiful recitation voice that drew the respect and admiration of many.\n\nHaniyeh toiled alongside Sheikh Yassin in the earliest stages of building important Islamic institutions in Gaza, including the establishment of the Islamic Society and the Islamic University. Despite his young age, Sheikh Yassin relied on him heavily and would call him one of the leaders of the future who would play a great role. Haniyeh joined the Islamic University, became the head of its student council, and then assumed a professorship there after graduation.\n\nHaving played a prominent role in the first intifada in 1987, Haniyeh was arrested alongside other Hamas leaders for three years. Although released from Israeli detention in 1991, he was deported a year later with the movement's leaders to Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon, where they cemented their resistance mindset before returning to Gaza in 1994.\n\nUnder the Oslo Accords, which Hamas strongly rejected, Haniyeh emerged as one of the movement's most critical voices to politically challenge the agreement, especially in the media. He swiftly rose to become director of Yassin's office and helped reorganize the Hamas' security, military, and religious apparatuses in the Gaza Strip, paving the way for the Second Intifada in 2000.\n\nAfter Israel's assassination of a stream Hamas leaders, Haniyeh was elected as the movement's Gaza leader in 2004, which marked a new chapter in the organization's history - a phase of comprehensive resistance, which culminated in Israel's troop withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. With a resounding victory for the \"Change and Reform\" platform Haniyeh led in the 2006 Palestinian elections, he became the head of the first elected Palestinian government in history.\n\nAs a government steeped in resistance doctrine that refused to recognize Israel, his administration was placed in direct confrontation with the occupation state. Haniyeh led Gaza and Hamas during three wars launched by Israeli military forces, in which he became a key target for assassination.\n\nIn 2017, Haniyeh was elected Hamas leader, succeeding Khaled Meshaal. Although forced to leave Gaza in 2019 for security reasons, he remained a powerful symbol for Palestinians in the strip and 'abroad,' able now to communicate regularly with heads of state, international organizations, and global media.\n\nWhen Israel launched its brutal military assault on Gaza last October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly threatened to assassinate Hamas leaders - despite knowing that targeting Haniyeh would have to be done in a third country. The assassination of Haniyeh is a violation of international law on so many levels: political assassination, breaching the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations, an act of aggression, and the targeting of a diplomatically immune person. Haniyeh was an international and Islamic symbol, and his killing is the stuff that triggers wars.\n\nBut will this blow to Hamas and the Palestinian people end their resistance to the occupation and deter them from retaliating against Israel? Decidedly not. Tel Aviv has murdered countless Palestinian leaders, thinkers, politicians, and military commanders in decades past, yet the events of 7 October 2023 took place, unhindered. The resistance and the broad segment of its population that supports these sacrifices wholeheartedly are likely to transform grief into further strength and resolve.\n\nFurthermore, they are calling - alongside West Asia's entire Axis of Resistance - for a hard retaliation against Israel, a punishment for a heinous crime that violated global laws and conventions.\n\nCurrent challenges\n\nHamas has a strong organizational structure that includes its Shura Council and Political Bureau - institutions that play an important role in managing the movement's affairs and making decisions. This is in addition to the judicial bodies that ensure internal justice and control of disputes.\n\nThe killings of Haniyeh and Arouri have left a gaping vacuum in Hamas, both at the leadership level and in its coordination with regional and international allies. But the movement has also historically proven its ability to overcome crises, as demonstrated in the aftermath of an Israeli assassination rampage against most of its leaders in Gaza and the West Bank in 2003 and 2004. Hamas showed remarkable resilience by overcoming its ordeal and went on to expand its clout, develop some astounding military and strategic capabilities, and continue its resistance struggle.\n\nFurthermore, today, Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, has stand-alone capabilities, resources, and funding, having expected the deepening of Israel's siege of Gaza and prepared for that eventuality. In recent days, messages coming from Gaza have emphasized the continuation of Al-Qassam's military operations.\n\nIf anything, Israel's killing of Haniyeh is interpreted by the resistance as a failure by Tel Aviv to achieve its military goals and a manifestation of deep weakness.\n\nHamas' next leader?\n\nSeveral prominent Hamas officials are likely replacements for Haniyeh. One is Hamas' Gaza chief, Yahya Sinwar, who is Haniyeh's deputy. Sinwar played a major role in engineering Operation Protective Edge with the Qassam Brigades and enjoys very close ties to the movement's security and military apparatuses. Despite his presence in Gaza, which is experiencing an ongoing war, Sinwar remains a strong leadership option.\n\nMeshaal is expected to play a pivotal role in leading the movement during this transitional period, given his prior experience as head of the political bureau until 2017. Although not a Resistance Axis favorite, Meshaal is familiar with regional political complexities and has strong relations with some key regional states, which could bridge the leadership vacuum for some time.\n\nAlthough tensions with Iran remain, Meshaal was among those who established relations with Tehran and strengthened cooperation after the Syrian war. He could endeavor to overcome any current differences by emphasizing the importance of Arab and Islamic unity at this crucial juncture, displaying preparedness to continue Hamas' confrontation with the Israeli occupation, and cleaving closely to the late Haniyeh's policies.\n\nOther prominent candidates include Nizar Awadallah, secretary of Hamas' executive committee and political bureau, a leader close to Haniyeh with broad acceptance within the movement. Despite his lack of media exposure, Awadallah's organizational competencies make him a possible choice.\n\nIran Pledges Response to 'Cowardly' Assassination of Hamas Leader in Tehran\n\nThere's also Musa Abu Marzouk, a former leader and head of the International Relations Office, who reportedly enjoys deep ties with countries such as China and Russia and is widely accepted within the movement.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, deputy to Yahya Sinwar and head of the Arab Relations Office, is a politically decisive figure with solid relations with Iran, Qatar, Turkiye, and Egypt. Hayya played an important role in the current ceasefire negotiations, has strong ties with the Resistance Axis, and is in constant contact with Hamas operatives inside and outside of occupied Palestine.\n\nDecades after its inception, Hamas has demonstrated that it is both a political institution and a strong grassroots movement capable of making critical decisions in the most difficult of circumstances.\n\nThe Shura Council, which has decision-making authority, will decide who leads the movement at this critical stage. Despite the great challenges facing Hamas - and its cadres on the battlefields of Gaza - it is likely to continue its resistance struggle and rearrange affairs to achieve its goals.\n\n(The

They did not specify where or whom, and at first it was thought to be a second strike in Lebanon after the targeting of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's most senior military commander and right-hand man to leader Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nBut it is certain that US security officials knew about the drone strike on Haniyeh within minutes of it happening. To cast Netanyahu as a leader in the grip of Jewish messianic fascists in ordering this strike, is only half of the story.\n\nWhen I met him two decades ago as a political outcast dubbed an extremist by my liberal Zionist hosts, Netanyahu had only one idea to impart: Iran was the mothership. Hamas and Hezbollah were only its aircraft carriers.\n\nNetanyahu's lifelong belief that he will lead his nation to victory by crushing the Palestinian national cause and preventing a state from ever seeing the light of day can never be discounted.\n\nToday, he might think he is on the cusp of his ultimate political achievement as Israel's longest-serving prime minister, by dragging the US and Britain into war with Iran.\n\nNegotiations torn up\n\nNetanyahu sent other messages, too, in killing Haniyeh, who had no involvement in the Hamas attack on 7 October, and whose bureau was in charge of negotiations with mediators Qatar and Egypt.\n\nNetanyahu has torn up negotiations and any thought of getting the hostages back alive. This should already have been obvious from the latest round of talks in Rome, where the Israeli side multiplied its conditions around phase one of the deal.\n\nIt was evident, too, from Netanyahu's last visit to Rafah, where he vowed Israel would retain indefinite control of the Philadelphi corridor.\n\nQatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has asked how negotiations can proceed when Israel has killed its negotiating counterpart.\n\nIn fact, Haniyeh was one member of a negotiating committee, which will carry on without him.\n\nAl Thani's barbed reaction was aimed at Netanyahu, who has done everything in his power to escalate regional tensions and to undermine the US administration's position on a permanent ceasefire, and its consistent opposition to opening a second front in Lebanon.\n\nIn killing a mild man like Haniyeh, who did not hide underground but lived out in the open, and who dedicated his career to negotiations and engagement with the Islamic world in Qatar, Turkey and Iran, Israel has killed a leader it could one day need to negotiate a hudna, or long-term ceasefire.\n\nOut of the equation\n\nIn person, Haniyeh was amiable, mild-mannered, an attentive listener, modest - the complete diplomat. He was never one to speak ill of Fatah or Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nIf, as now must be obvious even to the Israeli military, it will not be able to defeat or disable Hamas in Gaza, Israel will need people in Hamas to negotiate with. They have just killed one of them.\n\nFrom a strategic point of view, Israel's action is madness. This is not my word, but that used by former Israeli General Amiram Levin, who added, with some understatement, that the \"security forces should've strongly opposed\" the move.\n\nEven without a ceasefire, Haniyeh was worth more to Israel alive than dead.\n\nIsrael could have plausibly argued to a Western audience that it would not surrender Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to the International Criminal Court in The Hague while another of those named in the ICC's application for arrest warrants, Haniyeh, was free to live in Qatar and roam around the region.\n\nPressure would have inevitably been applied on Qatar to surrender him and expel the political bureau of Hamas.\n\nNow that he is out of the equation, Israel has lost that defence. All this, Israel has achieved in killing Haniyeh.\n\nHamas strengthened\n\nWhat Netanyahu can be sure he has not done is weaken Hamas.\n\nQuite the contrary. Haniyeh, a modest man who lost 60 members of his family, including sons and grandsons, to Israel in this war, will go down as one of Hamas' greatest martyrs.\n\nThe moment Haniyeh learned that his sons and grandsons had been killed in cars struck by Israeli forces during Eid, he was visiting a hospital in Doha where injured Palestinians from Gaza were being treated.\n\nHe said only: \"May God have mercy on them,\" but he refused to interrupt his visit. The clip went viral, because it spoke more than words could have done about his ability to put the Palestinian cause above his personal grief as a father.\n\nIsrael has killed countless Hamas leaders and commanders, and the movement has only grown - in recruits, weaponry and political influence. Today, polls show that Hamas would win in the West Bank if free elections were allowed to take place there.\n\nThe Hamas that has resisted Israel's attack on Gaza for 10 months is many times the size and capabilities of the Hamas in the days of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The quadriplegic founder of Hamas was killed when an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at him as he was being wheeled from Fajr prayers in Gaza. Haniyeh was his chief of staff. That assassination was internationally condemned.\n\nHamas' stock has risen, not fallen, in Palestine and the Arab and Muslim world since the 7 October attack. This is the only reason why the 88-year-old Abbas, who has continuously torn up reconciliation agreements, paid homage on Wednesday to his slain rival.\n\nAbbas condemned the killing as \"a cowardly act and a dangerous development\", and called on Palestinians to unite. Abbas spoke out of fear and political necessity, not out of any love for Hamas.\n\nWithin days of a reconciliation agreement among Palestinian factions negotiated in Beijing, Abbas' security forces tried and failed to arrest an injured commander of the Tulkarm Battalion from a hospital in the occupied West Bank.\n\nSo you can be absolutely sure that Abbas has no intention of unifying Fatah with the other Palestinian factions. Fatah's negotiator in Beijing might have been sincere, but for Abbas, Beijing was for show only. It made no difference on the ground in the occupied West Bank.\n\nFire in the region, fire at home\n\nNor is it a coincidence that Haniyeh's assassination was ordered within a day of Israeli fascists and far-right members of the Knesset breaking into a detention facility in an attempt to prevent soldiers from being arrested for raping a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nSetting fire to the region is Netanyahu's only response to the bushfire that is breaking out at home and on his doorstep.\n\nHundreds of detainees have emerged with harrowing accounts of the notorious Sde Teiman detention centre. Middle East Eye first reported on how iron bars, electric shocks, dogs and cigarette burns were used in torturing Palestinian detainees at Israeli detention centres.\n\nOmar Mahmoud Abdel Qader Samoud, who was detained for more than 42 days, said one of the rooms in the facility was known as the \"disco\".\n\n\"A soldier dragged me on the floor, naked and handcuffed, and placed me on a piece of rug,\" Samoud told MEE. \"The soldiers sprayed freezing cold water on me and placed a fan in front of me. They would leave me for a few days, without food or water or the possibility to get up and go to the bathroom. I urinated on myself and pleaded for mercy but they didn't care.\n\n\"The soldiers would kick me on all parts of my body,\" he added. \"Imagine yourself naked, handcuffed on the floor with five or six soldiers kicking you with their boots, hitting you with weapons and bats. Then they asked me to sit up. How could I possibly sit up? When I couldn't follow their orders they would beat me even harder. They completely smashed me. I thought this nightmare would never end.\"\n\nA month later, an anonymous doctor working at the same centre said limbs were amputated because of handcuff injuries, noting: \"We are all complicit in breaking the law.\"\n\nNo one was detained; nothing was investigated. But as pressure mounted from the ICC about war crimes in Gaza, alongside the ongoing genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Israeli military prosecutors felt obliged to act.\n\nIsrael could not argue that a domestic judicial process existed to examine such allegations of torture during detention, if the state did not use it. So nine soldiers accused of sexual abuse against a detainee, which led to him being hospitalized with serious injuries to his rectum, were arrested.\n\nBreakdown of the state\n\nWhat happened next was a complete breakdown of the state, similar to the 2021 assault on Congress by Trump supporters.\n\nThe arrests were met by angry demonstrations at the gates of Sde Teiman, with several protesters temporarily breaching the gates. Among the protesters were reservist soldiers, as well as two far-right parliamentarians: Zvi Sukkot, a member of the Religious Zionist movement, and Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu of the Jewish Power party.\n\nPolice took three hours to arrive. Herzi Halevi, the army's chief of general staff, had to break off a defence meeting on Israel's response to the recent attack on the Golan Heights to deal with the crisis. The army and police each blamed each other for the breakdown in law and order.\n\nFor a time, the accused soldiers barricaded themselves into Sde Teiman and used pepper spray to defend themselves against arrest, before eventually being taken into custody.\n\nIt is a mistake often made by those who style themselves as friends of Israel to cast such scenes as a fight between moderates and the extreme messianic right. This is wholly illusory, for the \"moderates\" are fully on board with continuing the murderous Gaza campaign. The \"moderates\" voted for the recent Knesset bill that rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nWhere they differ is means, rather than ends.\n\nIsraelis who cling to their Western identity are past masters of seizing Palestinian land in salami slices - subtly, quietly, without great fuss; but patiently, one property, one street, one high court case at a time. They care about their image, about being called global pariahs, and about the label of apartheid or war crimes being pinned on them personally.\n\nThe religious Zionist right, on the other hand, don't give a tinker's cuss about world opinion or international courts. They want annexation of the West Bank now. The sooner it happens, the better.\n\nCall it two-speed Zionism, but the goal is the same: a one-state solution in which the modern state of Israel dominates, if not overlays, the biblical Land of Israel, the land from the river to the sea.\n\nDeepening fractures\n\nBut it is a mistake, too, to underplay the ever-deepening fractures within Israel, which are occurring in the middle of a major war.\n\nIsrael portrays itself to the outside world as the one functioning state in a neighborhood of failed ones. You don't have to build a state in Israel, Netanyahu once bragged to US politicians in one of his many appearances before Congress: \"We're already built.\"\n\nBut that state is showing distinct signs of failing, too.\n\nNapoleon and Hitler were at the height of their powers, and their respective armies had tamed Europe under their jackboots, when each dictator thought it would be a good idea to attack Russia.\n\nSo, too, is Netanyahu endangering everything Israel has achieved in establishing a strong state by openly creating the conditions for a regional war.\n\nThe Israeli military knows the truth: that killing Haniyeh was the last thing they should be doing if they want to see any of their hostages back alive. They know they are not ready to attack southern Lebanon, because they don't have enough tanks or ammunition.\n\nThey know how well-armed Hezbollah, the Houthis and other resistance groups are, and how effective their rockets are. They know about geography and distances, and the vulnerability of Israel's population and economy to war on five fronts simultaneously. When Hezbollah threatens to close Ben Gurion Airport, or knock out the Israeli electrical grid, these are not empty threats.\n\nIsraeli security establishments also know they are in danger of losing command and control over their troops, and if they give the order to withdraw, many units may not obey.\n\nIsrael under Netanyahu's leadership is making the classic mistake of all colonial powers. It is overreaching in the messianic belief that the Jews really are God's chosen people; that the Bible ordained all of what is happening now, and that Israel can achieve its goal of complete military victory.\n\nIt is precisely at this moment that it is at its most vulnerable, and that the project could collapse.\n\nIn the final years of apartheid, the South African regime went into hyperdrive. It decided to overthrow the government of Angola, install a puppet regime in Namibia, and attack Zimbabwe, Botswana and Zambia - all fruitless projects that could not stave off regime collapse. Netanyahu's Israel is treading the same path.\n\nFor nothing other than self-preservation, those who understand this should act before Netanyahu involves them in a war they could not possibly stop, still less win.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_Eye", "type": "wiki",

Growing speculations in recent days suggest Khaled Mashal might return to the role after his resignation in 2017, but it seems that Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar isn't too keen to approve his reinstatement.\n\nNo other members of the terror group were picked to replace its politburo head nearly a week after his death. On Sunday, sources told the Lebanese network Al Mayadeen that Haniyeh's likely successor is the current head of Hamas's Shura Council, Abu Omar Hassan, who replaced Osama al-Mazini after he was assassinated shortly following October 7.\n\nAccording to the report, Hassan was set to replace Haniyeh during an interim period until the Hamas' upcoming elections. However, a short time later, the Hezbollah-affiliated outlet issued an apology saying, \"The matter is still under consultation. No candidate has been decided upon yet.\"\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh's deputy, Saleh al-Arouri, increased uncertainty within Hamas as he was marked as Haniyeh's natural successor if he were alive.\n\nLast week, Turkey's Foreign Ministry announced that Khaled Mashal would succeed Haniyeh as the leader of Hamas. However, reports suggest that Yahya Sinwar, who reportedly has a strained relationship with Mashal, has thwarted the move. This has left Hamas without a clear leader at a critical time.\n\nSaudi channel Al-Hadath reported last week that Sinwar prefers his deputy Khalil al-Hayya to take over the position. On Sunday, the news outlet claimed the likely leader would be Abu Omar Hassan, of whom little is known. He is currently based in the Gaza Strip\n\n\"Consultations within the movement are ongoing. Results will be published if they are reached,\" a Hamas source told the Saudi channel Asharq. The source hinted at the possibility of \"maintaining the current situation\" if there is no agreement on Haniyeh's successor until conditions are fit to hold an election.\n\nThis means Sinwar would remain in Gaza, Mashal would stay as Hamas' leader abroad, and Zaher Jabarin would remain as the leader in the West Bank.\n\n\"According to Hamas' internal regulations, the head of the central Shura Council is supposed to manage the movement in coordination with the organization's leaders in Gaza, the West Bank and abroad until general elections are held,\" another Hamas source said. \"However, the internal council's rules don't allow him to run for politburo leader.\"", "source": {"uri": "ynetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ynetnews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "einav_halabi@ynetnews.com", "name": "Einav Halabi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Mashal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khaled Mashal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Sinwar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahya Sinwar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saleh_al-Arouri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saleh al-Arouri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Revolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Revolution", "wgt": 7}], "image": "https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/crop_images/2021/10/06/r1XVdXEoVY/r1XVdXEoVY_117_181_897_505_0_large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 675, "textEnd": 684}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Israel is accused of carrying out the killing, but has not confirmed officially.\n\n\"Hamas will not succumb to any Arab or international political pressure to return to negotiations with the enemy before getting written guarantees that Israel will abide by the results of the talk that would lead to a ceasefire in the war-torn Gaza,\" a senior official of Hamas, who preferred to not be named, said to The New Arab.\n\n\"Because the United States and some countries are aligned with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he continues his genocidal war against our people, including assassinating of political and military leaders,\" the official said.\n\n\"Netanyahu thinks he will win the battle, but the truth is that he will not achieve any of his goals even if all the [Palestinian] leaders have been killed,\" he added, stressing that Hamas will stick to its terms and will not return to the negotiations anytime soon.\n\nSince 7 October 2023, Israel launched a genocidal war on the besieged coastal enclave after the Hamas-led Palestinian militants carried out an unprecedented attack on Israeli military bases and civilian settlements within and around the Gaza envelope, which Israel claims resulted in the deaths of 1,170 people and around 250 were taken captive.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza has killed over 39,623 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, and it has taken thousands of Palestinians captive.\n\n\"To end Palestinian suffering, Hamas has been involved in numerous rounds of negotiations, making concessions in favour of our people,\" the Hamas official said.\n\n\"However,\" he continues, \"Netanyahu was thwarting them all to maintain his political position. He [Netanyahu] knows very well that the end of the war means the end of his political existence, and he may go to prison on suspicion of corruption.\"\n\n\"Instead, Israel believed that it would force Hamas to make more concessions after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, but it pushed the movement to make more decisions that would prevent the indirect negotiations from proceeding,\" according to the official.\n\nCurrently, Hamas members are meeting to choose a new Hamas leader to replace Haniyeh. There have been indications that this new leader may not be revealed for fear that Israel will carry out a new assassination operation, according to Palestinian sources close to Hamas.\n\n\"As a result, Hamas will keep its negotiations with Israel frozen until further notice,\" the sources added.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel continues to issue states on new or contradictory conditions on any upcoming round of negotiations that goes against the ceasefire deal outlined by US president Joe Biden months ago.\n\n\"The United States is willing to guarantee to Israel that it will be able to renew fighting against Hamas in Gaza after the first phase of a potential ceasefire and hostage deal, as a means to pressure Hamas into releasing all the hostages it should in the first stage,\" reported Israeli media.\n\nAccording to the Yedioth Ahronoth and Haaretz dailies, \"Washington hasn't yet given a written guarantee, as Jerusalem has been demanding, but has agreed in principle to provide one if a deal materialises.\"\n\n\"If Israel receives such guarantees, it will mean a death sentence for the diplomatic efforts currently underway to bring Hamas back to the negotiating track to reach a deal,\" Hussam al-Dajani, a Gaza-based Political analyst, told TNA.\n\nHe believes that Hamas will not yield to any pressure, no matter how difficult, to return to negotiations without receiving written guarantees that Israel is ready to reach a ceasefire deal.\n\n\"Now, we can say that Hamas no longer has anything to lose. It has lost a lot and will not receive more severe blows than those it has received over the past 10 months,\" al-Dajani added.\n\nAl-Dajani also opined that Netanyahu wants to prolong the war until the end of the US elections, which will start next November, and the inauguration of its new president early next year, to gain time to achieve his political ambitions.\n\n\"If Donald Trump wins the US elections, it will be a victory for Netanyahu, who will show more intransigence and stubbornness in dealing with Gaza and Palestinian resistance,\" he added.\n\nIn contrast, al-Dajani argues, if Kamala Harris wins, Netanyahu will not hesitate to give up his illogical conditions and reach a ceasefire agreement, but after committing dozens of crimes against the Palestinian people.\n\nHani al-Masri, a Ramallah-based political expert, shared al-Dajani's opinion. \"Hamas decided to close the file of negotiations with Israel for a long time,\" he told TNA.\n\nIn turn, al-Masri notes that Israel has forced the Palestinian resistance to change its rules and commit to fighting Israeli soldiers in the besieged Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the Palestinian resistance will respond to the Israeli assassination of Hanyieh as soon as possible to break the Israeli deterrent force,\" al-Masri said.\n\n\"We will not be surprised if the resistance succeeds in assassinating an Israeli minister, kidnap more Israeli soldiers, or direct painful blows to Israel inside and outside Gaza,\" he added, noting that \"this will complicate bridging the gaps between the two sides in any new round of negotiations.\"", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

to Saudi reports.\n\nMohamed Ismail Darwish, the man leading Hamas' Shura Council, has been tapped as the interim chief following the death of Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in a bombing in Tehran last week, the Saudi-based Al Arabiya news reports.\n\nDarwish, who is also known as Abu Omer Hassan, will be in charge of coordinating between the terror group's leadership in Gaza, the West Bank, the diaspora and those in Israeli prisons until the group's 2025 elections.\n\nDarwish had been in charge of the Shura Council since his senior, Osama Mazini, was killed by the IDF in October.\n\nMazini was the man in charge of the 2011 hostage exchange that saw Hamas free IDF soldier Gilad Shalit in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including current Gaza chief and Oct. 7 mastermind Yahya Sinwar.\n\nThe Shura Council serves as Hamas' second-most-important political body, composed of elected officials from the four representative regions with leaders including Sinwar and diaspora chief Khaled Meshaal.\n\nThe council's membership is kept secret, and its members elect the 15 members of Hamas' Politburo, the main body that decides the government's actions and elects the terror group's leader.\n\nAs per Hamas' regulations, Darwish will not be able to throw his hat in the ring for the 2025 election.\n\nMeshaal, 68, having previously served as Hamas' top political chief and surviving an Israeli assassination in the 1990s, stands as the favorite to succeed Haniyeh.\n\nHaniyeh's assassination has thrown the Middle East into chaos as Iran, embarrassed by the top officials' assassination in their capital, vowed to strike Israel directly as revenge.\n\nThe looming attack has stoked fears of an all-out war between Israel and Iran and its proxies, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to retaliate against anyone who attacks the Jewish state.\n\nIt remains unclear when exactly Iran will attack, but the country has called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Wednesday to discuss Haniyeh's assassination and Iran's response.\n\nTehran has repeatedly claimed that although it will get revenge for the Hamas chief's death, it does not seek to spread the war in Gaza across the Middle East.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

widening war looms: report", "body": "Mideast cease-fire and hostage talks have been indefinitely halted till Iran decides its response to the assassination of a Hamas ally and selects a replacement for the terrorist, who was a key negotiator, officials say.\n\nThe talks in Qatar over an American-backed deal to free the roughly 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza will not resume until it's clear how Iran and its terrorist proxies will retaliate against Israel for the assassination of Hamas' top political chief and negotiator, Ismail Haniyeh, officials familiar with the tense negotiations told the Times of Israel on Monday.\n\nIran, which suffered an embarrassing blow after the Palestinian terror leader was killed by a bomb in Tehran, has vowed to directly strike Israel for allegedly orchestrating the assassination.\n\nFuad Shukr, a commander of the Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon, was also killed in a Beirut attack, prompting another ominous threat against Israel by that group in retaliation.\n\nIran and the terror groups' promised bloody attacks are set to affect how the cease-fire negotiations will continue -- and Qatari, Egyptian and US mediators are worried that Haniyeh's death has only complicated the already-difficult discussions.\n\nHamas so far has not shown any interest in resuming the talks until it elects a replacement for Haniyeh, who led the Hamas Politburo, the council that oversees the terrorists' rule over Gaza.\n\nIt's unclear when the terrorist group will vote for Haniyeh's replacement and who the new chief will be, but sources told the Times that Hamas could name a successor in the coming days.\n\nHamas sources told Reuters last week that the top candidate to replace Haniyeh would be former Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal, the man who was poisoned by Israeli agents in the 1990s and survived only after Israel was forced to hand over an antidote.\n\nWhile Iranian officials have repeatedly claimed that the approaching attack on Israel will not trigger an all-out war in the Middle East, Netanyahu said the Jewish state is very well prepared for the possibility against \"Iran's axis of evil.\"\n\nOn Monday, President Biden spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan to discuss efforts to \"de-escalate regional tensions,\" a move that came just a day after Jordan's foreign minister met with Iranian officials to persuade them from attacking Israel and triggering a multifront war.\n\nIsrael is already in constant battle with Hezbollah along the northern border, with Lebanon's health ministry reporting that at least two people were killed in an Israeli airstrike Monday.\n\nThe attack came as Hezbollah struck northern Israel in a drone attack earlier in the day, leaving two Israel Defense Force soldiers wounded and causing a blaze.\n\nMeanwhile, in the southern-front against Hamas, a new analysis from the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project, the Institute for the Study of War and CNN shows that Hamas' battalions are beginning to regroup despite Israel claiming victory against all but four of them.\n\nThe analysis said at least eight battalions are now combat-effective, as Israel struggles to carry out its goal of completely eliminating Hamas, a goal many foreign officials have already described as unrealistic.\n\nThe resurgence of Hamas's battalions have caused the IDF to retread on areas in Gaza previously cleared out, forcing thousands of Palestinian civilians to evacuate yet again as the war approaches its 10-month.\n\nThe new evacuation orders have renewed cries over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which were only further stoked Monday after Israel's finance minister suggested that blocking humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip is \"justified and moral.\n\n\"Nobody will let us cause 2 million civilians to die of hunger even though it might be justified and moral until our hostages are returned,\" Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said about the pressure Israel is facing to increase aid to Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They did not specify where or whom, and at first it was thought to be a second strike in Lebanon after the targeting of Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah's most senior military commander and right-hand man to leader Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nBut it is certain that US security officials knew about the drone strike on Haniyeh within minutes of it happening. To cast Netanyahu as a leader in the grip of Jewish messianic fascists in ordering this strike, is only half of the story.\n\nWhen I met him two decades ago as a political outcast dubbed an extremist by my liberal Zionist hosts, Netanyahu had only one idea to impart: Iran was the mothership. Hamas and Hezbollah were only its aircraft carriers.\n\nNetanyahu's lifelong belief that he will lead his nation to victory by crushing the Palestinian national cause and preventing a state from ever seeing the light of day can never be discounted.\n\nToday, he might think he is on the cusp of his ultimate political achievement as Israel's longest-serving prime minister, by dragging the US and Britain into war with Iran.\n\nNetanyahu sent other messages, too, in killing Haniyeh, who had no involvement in the Hamas attack on 7 October, and whose bureau was in charge of negotiations with mediators Qatar and Egypt.\n\nNetanyahu has torn up negotiations and any thought of getting the hostages back alive. This should already have been obvious from the latest round of talks in Rome, where the Israeli side multiplied its conditions around phase one of the deal.\n\nIt was evident, too, from Netanyahu's last visit to Rafah, where he vowed Israel would retain indefinite control of the Philadelphi corridor.\n\nQatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has asked how negotiations can proceed when Israel has killed its negotiating counterpart.\n\nIn fact, Haniyeh was one member of a negotiating committee, which will carry on without him.\n\nAl Thani's barbed reaction was aimed at Netanyahu, who has done everything in his power to escalate regional tensions and to undermine the US administration's position on a permanent ceasefire, and its consistent opposition to opening a second front in Lebanon.\n\nIn killing a mild man like Haniyeh, who did not hide underground but lived out in the open, and who dedicated his career to negotiations and engagement with the Islamic world in Qatar, Turkey and Iran, Israel has killed a leader it could one day need to negotiate a hudna, or long-term ceasefire.\n\nIn person, Haniyeh was amiable, mild-mannered, an attentive listener, modest - the complete diplomat. He was never one to speak ill of Fatah or Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nIf, as now must be obvious even to the Israeli military, it will not be able to defeat or disable Hamas in Gaza, Israel will need people in Hamas to negotiate with. They have just killed one of them.\n\nFrom a strategic point of view, Israel's action is madness. This is not my word, but that used by former Israeli General Amiram Levin, who added, with some understatement, that the \"security forces should've strongly opposed\" the move.\n\nEven without a ceasefire, Haniyeh was worth more to Israel alive than dead.\n\nIsrael could have plausibly argued to a western audience that it would not surrender Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to the International Criminal Court in The Hague while another of those named in the ICC's application for arrest warrants, Haniyeh, was free to live in Qatar and roam around the region.\n\nPressure would have inevitably been applied on Qatar to surrender him and expel the political bureau of Hamas.\n\nNow that he is out of the equation, Israel has lost that defence. All this, Israel has achieved in killing Haniyeh.\n\nWhat Netanyahu can be sure he has not done is weaken Hamas.\n\nQuite the contrary. Haniyeh, a modest man who lost 60 members of his family, including sons and grandsons, to Israel in this war, will go down as one of Hamas' greatest martyrs.\n\nThe moment Haniyeh learned that his sons and grandsons had been killed in cars struck by Israeli forces during Eid, he was visiting a hospital in Doha where injured Palestinians from Gaza were being treated.\n\nHe said only: \"May God have mercy on them,\" but he refused to interrupt his visit. The clip went viral, because it spoke more than words could have done about his ability to put the Palestinian cause above his personal grief as a father.\n\nIsrael has killed countless Hamas leaders and commanders, and the movement has only grown - in recruits, weaponry and political influence. Today, polls show that Hamas would win in the West Bank if free elections were allowed to take place there.\n\nThe Hamas that has resisted Israel's attack on Gaza for 10 months is many times the size and capabilities of the Hamas in the days of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The quadriplegic founder of Hamas was killed when an Israeli helicopter gunship fired a missile at him as he was being wheeled from Fajr prayers in Gaza. Haniyeh was his chief of staff. That assassination was internationally condemned.\n\nHamas' stock has risen, not fallen, in Palestine and the Arab and Muslim world since the 7 October attack. This is the only reason why the 88-year-old Abbas, who has continuously torn up reconciliation agreements, paid homage on Wednesday to his slain rival.\n\nAbbas condemned the killing as \"a cowardly act and a dangerous development\", and called on Palestinians to unite. Abbas spoke out of fear and political necessity, not out of any love for Hamas.\n\nWithin days of a reconciliation agreement among Palestinian factions negotiated in Beijing, Abbas' security forces tried and failed to arrest an injured commander of the Tulkarm Battalion from a hospital in the occupied West Bank.\n\nSo you can be absolutely sure that Abbas has no intention of unifying Fatah with the other Palestinian factions. Fatah's negotiator in Beijing might have been sincere, but for Abbas, Beijing was for show only. It made no difference on the ground in the occupied West Bank.\n\nNor is it a coincidence that Haniyeh's assassination was ordered within a day of Israeli fascists and far-right members of the Knesset breaking into a detention facility in an attempt to prevent soldiers from being arrested for raping a Palestinian prisoner.\n\nSetting fire to the region is Netanyahu's only response to the bushfire that is breaking out at home and on his doorstep.\n\nHundreds of detainees have emerged with harrowing accounts of the notorious Sde Teiman detention centre. Middle East Eye first reported on how iron bars, electric shocks, dogs and cigarette burns were used in torturing Palestinian detainees at Israeli detention centres.\n\nOmar Mahmoud Abdel Qader Samoud, who was detained for more than 42 days, said one of the rooms in the facility was known as the \"disco\".\n\n\"A soldier dragged me on the floor, naked and handcuffed, and placed me on a piece of rug,\" Samoud told MEE. \"The soldiers sprayed freezing cold water on me and placed a fan in front of me. They would leave me for a few days, without food or water or the possibility to get up and go to the bathroom. I urinated on myself and pleaded for mercy but they didn't care.\n\n\"The soldiers would kick me on all parts of my body,\" he added. \"Imagine yourself naked, handcuffed on the floor with five or six soldiers kicking you with their boots, hitting you with weapons and bats. Then they asked me to sit up. How could I possibly sit up? When I couldn't follow their orders they would beat me even harder. They completely smashed me. I thought this nightmare would never end.\"\n\nA month later, an anonymous doctor working at the same centre said limbs were amputated because of handcuff injuries, noting: \"We are all complicit in breaking the law.\"\n\nNo one was detained; nothing was investigated. But as pressure mounted from the ICC about war crimes in Gaza, alongside the ongoing genocide case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Israeli military prosecutors felt obliged to act.\n\nIsrael could not argue that a domestic judicial process existed to examine such allegations of torture during detention, if the state did not use it. So nine soldiersaccused of sexual abuse against a detainee, which led to him being hospitalised with serious injuries to his rectum, were arrested.\n\nWhat happened next was a complete breakdown of the state, similar to the 2021 assault on Congress by Trump supporters.\n\nThe arrests were met by angry demonstrations at the gates of Sde Teiman, with several protesters temporarily breaching the gates. Among the protesters were reservist soldiers, as well as two far-right parliamentarians: Zvi Sukkot, a member of the Religious Zionist movement, and Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu of the Jewish Power party.\n\nPolice took three hours to arrive. Herzi Halevi, the army's chief of general staff, had to break off a defence meeting on Israel's response to the recent attack on the Golan Heights to deal with the crisis. The army and police each blamed each other for the breakdown in law and order.\n\nFor a time, the accused soldiers barricaded themselves into Sde Teiman and used pepper spray to defend themselves against arrest, before eventually being taken into custody.\n\nIt is a mistake often made by those who style themselves as friends of Israel to cast such scenes as a fight between moderates and the extreme messianic right. This is wholly illusory, for the \"moderates\" are fully on board with continuing the murderous Gaza campaign. The \"moderates\" voted for the recent Knesset bill that rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nWhere they differ is means, rather than ends.\n\nIsraelis who cling to their western identity are past masters of seizing Palestinian land in salami slices - subtly, quietly, without great fuss; but patiently, one property, one street, one high court case at a time. They care about their image, about being called global pariahs, and about the label of apartheid or war crimes being pinned on them personally.\n\nThe religious Zionist right, on the other hand, don't give a tinker's cuss about world opinion or international courts. They want annexation of the West Bank now. The sooner it happens, the better.\n\nCall it two-speed Zionism, but the goal is the same: a one-state solution in which the modern state of Israel dominates, if not overlays, the biblical Land of Israel, the land from the river to the sea.\n\nBut it is a mistake, too, to underplay the ever-deepening fractures within Israel, which are occurring in the middle of a major war.\n\nIsrael portrays itself to the outside world as the one functioning state in a neighbourhood of failed ones. You don't have to build a state in Israel, Netanyahu once bragged to US politicians in one of his many appearances before Congress: \"We're already built.\"\n\nBut that state is showing distinct signs of failing, too.\n\nNapoleon and Hitler were at the height of their powers, and their respective armies had tamed Europe under their jackboots, when each dictator thought it would be a good idea to attack Russia.\n\nSo, too, is Netanyahu endangering everything Israel has achieved in establishing a strong state by openly creating the conditions for a regional war.\n\nThe Israeli military knows the truth: that killing Haniyeh was the last thing they should be doing if they want to see any of their hostages back alive. They know they are not ready to attack southern Lebanon, because they don't have enough tanks or ammunition.\n\nThey know how well-armed Hezbollah, the Houthis and other resistance groups are, and how effective their rockets are. They know about geography and distances, and the vulnerability of Israel's population and economy to war on five fronts simultaneously. When Hezbollah threatens to close Ben Gurion Airport, or knock out the Israeli electrical grid, these are not empty threats.\n\nIsraeli security establishments also know they are in danger of losing command and control over their troops, and if they give the order to withdraw, many units may not obey.\n\nIsrael under Netanyahu's leadership is making the classic mistake of all colonial powers. It is overreaching in the messianic belief that the Jews really are God's chosen people; that the Bible ordained all of what is happening now, and that Israel can achieve its goal of complete military victory.\n\nIt is precisely at this moment that it is at its most vulnerable, and that the project could collapse.\n\nIn the final years of apartheid, the South African regime went into hyperdrive. It decided to overthrow the government of Angola, install a puppet regime in Namibia, and attack Zimbabwe, Botswana and Zambia - all fruitless projects that could not stave off regime collapse. Netanyahu's Israel is treading the same path.\n\nFor nothing other than self-preservation, those who understand this should act before Netanyahu involves them in a war they could not possibly stop, still less win.\n\nDue to the Israeli war crimes in Gaza we have increased our coverage from five to six days a week.

Al-Sinwar, 61, is one of the main figures Israel vehemently seeks to target.\n\nAl-Sinwar had been sentenced to four life sentences and spent 22 years in prison. He was one of more than 1,000 Palestinian detainees who were released in 2011 in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\n\nObservers believe that choosing Al-Sinwar as the leader of the resistance movement is in itself a warning message to Israel.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the assassination, Hamas announced that it had begun consultations among its leadership and other bodies to elect a successor. It also issued statements reassuring supporters that its executive and Shura institutions were functioning normally and that the organisation could sustain the resistance under the most arduous circumstances.\n\n\"Since the first hours after the assassination, the movement's Political Bureau and Shura Council have held a series of meetings and intensive discussions informed by a high sense of responsibility to elect a successor in accordance with established procedures and regulations,\" Hamas said in a statement, adding that it would announce the results as soon as the process was complete.\n\nHuge crowds of mourners assembled to bid farewell to Haniyeh in funeral ceremonies for him in Tehran and Doha. Elsewhere, millions joined in commemorative prayers amidst widespread calls to avenge his assassination.\n\nHaniyeh was a towering figure in the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). He was born on 23 January 1962 in the Shati Refugee Camp in Gaza, where his parents had fled from the ethnic cleansing and destruction of the Palestinian village of Jura during the Nakba in 1948.\n\nAfter completing his primary and secondary education in schools operated by the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), he obtained a diploma from the Al-Azhar Institute in Gaza and then a BA in Arabic literature from the Islamic University in Gaza in 1987.\n\nHe became a dean at this university in 1992. In 1997, he headed the office of Hamas' founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and then went on to rise in the ranks of the resistance organisation.\n\nHaniyeh became politically active in university, taking part in the first Intifada (1987-1993) against the Israeli occupation. He was arrested for the first time in 1987, again a year later, and then a third time in 1989. The latter arrest led to his imprisonment for three years. Upon his release in 1992, he was exiled to Marj Al-Zuhur in Southern Lebanon; however, he was able to return to Gaza a year later after the signing of the Oslo Accords.\n\nHe had numerous scrapes with death. On 6 September 2003, he was wounded during an Israeli raid targeting Hamas leaders, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. On 14 October 2006, after he had been elected to head the Palestinian Government in Gaza, he was prevented from re-entering Gaza after a trip abroad and then, on 20 October, his convoy was targeted during an armed clash between Fatah and Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli occupation army has targeted Haniyeh's home repeatedly during its wars against Gaza, demolishing it completely during its current frenzy of destruction.\n\nHaniyeh was elected head of the Palestinian Government in Gaza after Hamas won a decisive majority in the internationally monitored legislative elections in 2006. The results triggered a power struggle between Hamas and Fatah, the other main Palestinian faction, which culminated in Haniyeh's dismissal by current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in June 2007 and a permanent geopolitical rift between the Fatah-led West Bank and the Hamas-led Gaza Strip.\n\nIn May 2017, he was elected head of the Hamas Political Bureau, a post he held until his assassination on 31 July.\n\n\"Everyone in Hamas is in a state of emergency, including those residing abroad. The movement is in disarray because the Israeli occupation has already assassinated several other Political Bureau members and is hunting down all first-tier Hamas leaders,\" Palestinian political analyst Nidal Khadra told Al-Ahram Weekly.\n\n\"Haniyeh was a unifying figure and the political umbrella of the Al-Aqsa Flood Operation,\" political analyst Hani Al-Dali, an expert on the Palestinian resistance, told the Weekly.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin \"Netanyahu thought that by assassinating him he could claim a victory where the occupation forces on the ground have failed. He wants to bring Hamas to its knees and calculates that whoever succeeds Haniyeh will be more flexible,\" he said.\n\n\"But Hamas is aware of Netanyahu's guile and insidious aims. So, Haniyeh's successor will undoubtedly be even firmer and more resolute, in order to show that Hamas will remain steadfast and never yield.\"\n\nWhile Hamas has a central leadership, it is not a centralised organisation, Al-Dali said. \"The decentralisation is one of its strengths and enables it to withstand many military and political blows and the diplomatic blockade,\" he said. Unlike some who expect tensions within Hamas over the succession, he expects the transition to proceed very smoothly.\n\n\"The assassination of Haniyeh is the most consequential carried out by Israel in decades,\" political analyst Mohsen Abu Ramadan told the Weekly. \"The aim was to create a political, military, and diplomatic coup that Netanyahu could exploit domestically and externally to compensate for his failures and reestablish Israel's aura of deterrence.\"\n\n\"Netanyahu has long been bent on killing all the leaders of the Palestinian cause. With this latest assassination, he aimed to break Hamas' resolve and disrupt its political and organisational cohesion, which it brought with it to the negotiations during the current war.\"\n\n\"What he did succeed in is obstructing the ceasefire talks, which confirms that the release of the Israeli hostages is very low on his scale of priorities.\"\n\nIn Abu Ramadan's opinion, the assassination simultaneously betrays Netanyahu's desire to prolong the war in Gaza and to resist the domestic, regional, and international calls for a ceasefire.\n\n\"His popularity has soared among the Israeli public, which has been in a state of euphoria since the assassination. But he will pay the price as Israel's state of emergency drags on for many more months, wreaking a severe toll on the Israeli economy,\" he said.\n\nKhadra said that the assassination marked a turning point in Israel's 10-month old war of genocide against Gaza.\n\n\"Either this will lead to a major military escalation in the region or to a process of diplomatic containment, pushing Israel, unable to achieve a victory, to accept the truce proposal presented by US President Joe Biden, thereby forestalling the outbreak of a regional war,\" he commented.\n\nMany analysts believe that choosing Al-Sinwar will complicate -- if not freeze -- the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas. Not only will this further delay the release of the hostages, but it will also add more fuel to the regional tinderbox, although some analysts believe that limited responses by Hamas or Tehran might contain the situation.\n\nAyman Al-Raqab, a political science professor at Al-Quds University in Jerusalem, believes that Israel had a green light from Washington to carry out the recent assassinations in the heart of Beirut and Tehran, which occurred immediately after Netanyahu's return from his trip to the US.\n\nThis suggests that Israel felt confident that the response to its acts would be limited. At the same time, according to Al-Raqab, the path to a ceasefire has been blocked and will not reopen until after the US presidential elections in November or after the new president takes office in January 2025, as Netanyahu intended.\n\nIn Khadra's opinion, the assassination of Haniyeh also delivered a message to Iran that its support for Hamas has become too costly to sustain. Hamas might therefore be compelled to look for support elsewhere. Hamas would not be able to sustain a full-scale war for long without support from the outside, Khadra said.\n\nAt the same time, the assassination compounds the pressures on the Hamas leadership to be more flexible in the negotiations, because if it does not reach an agreement, the assassinations will continue. Khadra also believes that mounting pressures inside Israel and the US might force Netanyahu into a ceasefire agreement, especially since the 10-month assault in Gaza has outlived its purpose.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UNRWA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahram_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al-Ahram Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temple Mount"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shura", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nakba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Yassin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Yassin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Hamas, the Palestinian militant organization that instigated the latest round of armed conflict with Israel last October, is similar to many other such nationalist organizations in the region and beyond in that it consists of both political and military wings. Hamas could perhaps be categorized as a two-in-one militant entity, with a consistent goal of driving Jews in general and Zionists (those advocating the formation of modern Israel as a state in Palestine) in particular out of Palestine so that the Palestinians (or Palestinian Arabs) can establish a state there encompassing the whole of current Israel. Israel thus sees Hamas as a terrorist organization. However, Hamas employs various methods in its nationalist struggle, such as guerrilla warfare on the military front, which has kept Israel hastening to respond for many years. For example, in October last year, Hamas suddenly launched a large-scale infiltration into Israel from the Gaza Strip, which was then ruled by Hamas, causing many casualties on the Israeli side.\n\nIsrael's retaliation against the Hamas attack has been on a very large scale and criticized by many as grossly disproportionate, almost flattening the entire Gaza Strip. The Israeli counterstrike against Hamas continues despite the heavy casualties among the local residents in Gaza. Two months ago, the International Criminal Court (ICC), under the auspices of the United Nations, finally indicted the leaders responsible for the war on both the Israeli and Palestinian sides, charging them with war crimes and crimes against humanity. Perhaps partially as a result of this, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was among those indicted, felt a particular need to once again make a special trip to Washington, D.C., to drum up American support for Israel in general and himself in particular.\n\nAccording to the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, all signatory member states are obliged to extradite the indicted persons to The Hague in the Netherlands for trial if they set foot in these countries. Naturally, the hardline Netanyahu was unwilling to comply with the warrant for his arrest and enlisted the support of the majority of pro-Israel members of the US Congress to invite him to speak there. Although some Muslim or Arab members of Congress protested by holding up signs during Netanyahu's speech, both President Biden and former President Trump had to meet with Netanyahu, as Jewish political donations and votes are important to both the Democratic and Republican parties in a neck-to-neck election year in the US.\n\nSince the US is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, Netanyahu was able to act and travel freely and prominently there. However, the situation was different in the United Kingdom, where the new left-wing Labor government, which is perhaps more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, decided to withdraw its objection to the ICC arrest warrant against Netanyahu. As such, in principle, if Netanyahu were to set foot in the UK, he could well be extradited by the British authorities.\n\nBack to Hamas. At the political level, Hamas was the de facto ruler of the Gaza Strip until the large-scale Israeli invasion in the aftermath of the Hamas attacks on Israel. Hamas was thus expected to provide a degree of governance to Gaza, thus needing a certain degree of governmental organization to provide public services, ranging from utilities to health. In the last Palestinian elections held about two years ago, Hamas won the majority of seats, and its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, became the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. However, severe discord later arose between Hamas and Fatah, the organization traditionally leading the Palestinian national liberation movement, resulting in Ismail Haniyeh being dismissed from his position as prime minister. Nonetheless, since there has been no election since then, Ismail Haniyeh has continued to claim himself as the prime minister of the entire Palestinian territory.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nLast week, almost on the eve of Netanyahu making his Washington rounds, China successfully brokered a reconciliation deal among the more than a dozen Palestinian groups, big and small, that all claimed to represent the Palestinian nationalist cause to various degrees. The Palestinian groups, Hamas and Fatah (the faction most internationally recognized as being the mainstream Palestinian movement) included, signed the Beijing Declaration, supposedly paving the way for an eventual national unity government that would lead to Palestinian statehood. Frankly, if modern history were any lesson, it remains to be seen how long such a long-sought-after truce among the Palestinian groups would hold up. The aforementioned 2005 Palestinian election, for example, was also supposed to democratically install a legitimate Palestinian government, but it soon descended into another round of confrontation between Fatah and Hamas that persisted for many years. Incidentally, in the same ICC announcement as that concerning Netanyahu, Haniyeh was also indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nOn the political front, Hamas also recognizes the necessity of engaging in diplomacy on the international stage to enhance its power and legitimacy. This effort was primarily led by Ismail Haniyeh. He established Hamas' political headquarters in exile in Qatar, one of the few Arab countries sympathetic to Hamas, using it as a base to travel to various \"friendly\" countries around the world to seek assistance. The most supportive and generous Middle Eastern country in aiding Hamas is Iran, which is diametrically opposed to Israel. When Iran's new president was inaugurated recently, Ismail Haniyeh obligatorily attended the ceremony in person to offer congratulations. Shortly thereafter, Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated at his residence in Tehran, Iran's capital, an act widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The news shocked the international community, as Ismail Haniyeh was also Hamas' representative in behind-the-scenes negotiations with Israel regarding ceasefires and hostage releases. This assassination not only demonstrated Israel's resolve to continue its military actions but also served as a stern warning to Iran's new government that such an assassination could be conducted right under its nose. Meanwhile, Israel also announced that earlier this month, it had successfully killed the leader of Hamas' military wing. These events are likely to trigger another serious round of conflict, indicating that the Middle East will remain a hotbed of activities for some time to come, and those of us, even in distant parts, would have to brace ourselves for the incidental onslaught.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ei_sun_oh@manilatimes.net",

On being asked about India's role amid the ongoing crisis in West Asia, the Iranian envoy said, \"Since the beginning of the tragic events and crimes of Israel in Gaza, I repeatedly mentioned that India is an important country, is a big power and influential country in the international community. Besides this, it has good relations with Israel and Iran and also India, as a non-aligned movement founder had supported Palestine case in the history of the region.\"\n\nIsrael is facing a strategic defeat in Gaza\n\n\"So, there is an expectation that India can and should play a more active role in the current crisis in the region and tensions in the region.

Following this, Israel launched a strong counteroffensive, carrying out military operations against Hamas in the Gaza Strip with the aim of \"completely eliminating\" the group.\n\nThe tensions in West Asia have further escalated after Hamas' political bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Iran's capital, Tehran on Wednesday (July 31, 2024). The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that Ismail Haniyeh had been killed in an attack in Tehran. A projectile hit a residence allocated to war veterans in Tehran at 2 a.m. (local time), according to a Press TV report.\n\nHaniyeh, who was based in Qatar, travelled to Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Iranian President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, according to a Press TV report.\n\nOn Thursday (August 1, 2024), the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) announced that Hamas military wing commander Mohammed Deif had been killed in an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip on July 13. In a post on X, IDF stated, \"We can now confirm: Mohammed Deif was eliminated.\" The Israeli military said that it obtained intelligence confirming his death in the past few hours.\n\nIran says a short-range projectile killed Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh, reiterates vows of retaliation\n\nDeif was targeted in a strike at Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa'a Salameh's compound in Khan Younis area on July 13, The Times of Israel reported. A day later, the IDF confirmed the death of Salameh. However, it did not have final information on Deif. The IDF believed that its intelligence indicated that Deif visiting the compound belonging to Salameh was highly accurate and the two Hamas military officials were together in the building that was hit with several heavy munitions, according to The Times of Israel report.\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF said that top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in the Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday (local time) (July 6, 2024). The IDF said Shukr was \"responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs\" and for the terror group's \"force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel,\" The Times of Israel reported.\n\nOn Tuesday (July 30, 2024), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his nation has delivered \"crushing blows\" to enemies in the last few days, CNN reported. He made the remarks hours after the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news",

No detailed information was shared about the subject.\n\nThere is tension between Iran and Israel due to the genocide committed by Israel in Gaza, which has been under occupation since October 7. Most recently, tension escalated between Iran and Israel after the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau Chief Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Lebanon.\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was in Tehran to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iranian President Mahmoud Pezeshkian. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards announced in a statement on July 31 that an attack was carried out on Haniyeh's residence in Tehran. Iran and the Hamas Movement held Israel responsible for the cowardly assassination.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, born in a refugee camp in Gaza in 1962, has been an important figure since the establishment of Hamas.

The Palestinian militant grou on Tuesday named Yahya Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks, as its new leader, a highly provocative move that could inflame tensions further and deeply complicate U.S. hopes for a cease-fire.\n\nThe appointment of Mr. Sinwar to replace Haniyeh comes just weeks after China last month hosted leaders from both Hamas and the rival Palestinian faction the Fatah Party, a meeting that could be viewed as evidence of Beijing's evolution into a serious diplomatic power and a powerful player with influence in all theaters of the globe. The meeting, which was largely dismissed in the West, was aimed at establishing a post-war governing structure between the two hostile Palestinian camps in Gaza.\n\nAll of that, Mr. Koren said, is further proof that the Oct. 7 attack and its ripple effects have stretched far beyond Israel and Gaza.\n\n\"All of the sudden, the local attack of Hamas on Israel became global, due to the fact that it was supported by China, of course by Iran, and by Russia,\" Mr. Koren told \"The Washington Brief.\"\n\n\"That means Hamas didn't do anything without at least knowledge or guidance of Iran, first and foremost, and support for the first time, very active support of China and, of course, the support of Russia,\" he said. \"They're all involved in the story.\"\n\nEnemy alliances\n\nIran made no secret of its support for the Hamas attack on Israel. It has long served as the primary financial backer of the group, and of other Israeli enemies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nBut Mr. Koren, whose diplomatic career included a stint as Israel's ambassador to Egypt, in his remarks cast the spotlight on Russia and China as well, both of which have been cultivating deeper economic and military ties with Iran and have a history of using their powerful spots on the United Nations Security Council to block pro-Israel resolutions. Iran, Russia and China also held major joint naval drills earlier this year, among other recent instances of cooperation between their armed forces.\n\nChina also has carefully worded its statements in the months since the Oct. 7 attack, calling on all parties to refrain from violence but stopping miles short of the condemnation of Hamas voiced by the U.S. and some of its allies. And the Chinese Foreign Ministry was sharply critical of the operation that killedHaniyeh, predicting it would only inflame an already volatile situation in the region.\n\n\"China firmly opposes and condemns the act of assassination and is deeply concerned that the incident may plunge the region into greater turmoil. China has been calling for settling regional disputes through negotiation and dialogue and an early, comprehensive and permanent cease-fire in Gaza and there should be no more escalation of the conflict and confrontation,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters said last week.\n\nMr. Koren even added North Korea to the equation, citing its links to both Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\n\"North Korea took part in the building of the tunnels of Hezbollah. And recently we found a lot of the munitions in Gaza [came from] North Korea,\" he said, pointing to public news accounts of North Korean links to the anti-Israel groups.\n\nBoth North Korea and Iran have also provided drones and munitions to Russia for its war in Ukraine, further cementing the cooperation of those anti-democratic regimes and forming pieces of the web of alliances that could be viewed as linking Hamas to both Moscow and Beijing.\n\nThe brightest spotlight is now on Tehran, as U.S. officials fear that the theocratic regime there may soon launch a second round of retaliatory attacks against Israel. An April attack on Israel, in response to an apparent Israeli strike in Syria that killed a key Iranian general, was stopped by Israeli and U.S. defenses. But there are growing fears that the next Iranian attack might be far worse, perhaps of a scale that overwhelms Israel's state-of-the-art missile defenses.\n\nThe Jewish state also appears on the verge of a full-scale war with Hezbollah, which would create a two-front war that would stretch the Israeli Defense Forces.\n\nAt Tuesday's event, Alexandre Mansourov, a professor at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies, questioned whether the recent inauguration of new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian -- the reason Haniyeh was in Tehran in the first place -- could have any effect on the Middle East powder keg. Mr. Pezeshkian has cast himself as something of a reformer and a political figure willing to perhaps reopen diplomatic channels with the West.\n\nMr. Koren said he doesn't expect any changes beneath the surface in Tehran.\n\n\"I don't believe they will change,\" he said. \"They will try to show [that] ... 'we are nice people. The Zionists are the problem, not us.' They will do anything to make a nice image.\"\n\nFormer CIA official Joseph DeTrani, who moderated Tuesday's event, cited the growing alarm in national security circles about Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\n\"They're really a threshold nuclear weapons state and they're moving in that direction,\" he said.\n\nAsked at what point Israel might take military action to stop the Iranian nuclear threat, Mr. Koren said any such decisions would come in consultation with Washington.\n\n\"We cannot go into any kind of activity against Iran without the U.S.,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Beside this, it has good relations with Israel and Iran and also India, as a non-aligned movement founder had supported Palestine case in the history of the region.\"\n\n\"So, there is an expectation that India can and should play more active role in the current crisis in the region and tensions in the region.

A projectile hit a residence allocated to war veterans in Tehran at 2 am (local time), according to a Press TV report.\n\nHaniyeh, who was based in Qatar, travelled to Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Iranian President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian, according to a Press TV report.\n\nOn August 1, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) on Thursday announced that Hamas military wing commander Mohammed Deif had been killed in an airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip on July 13.\n\nIn a post on X, IDF stated, \"We can now confirm: Mohammed Deif was eliminated.\"The Israeli military said that it obtained intelligence confirming his death in the past few hours. Deif was targeted in a strike at Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa'a Salameh's compound in Khan Younis area on July 13, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nA day later, the IDF confirmed the death of Salameh. However, it did not have final information on Deif. The IDF believed that its intelligence indicated that Deif visiting the compound belonging to Salameh was highly accurate and the two Hamas military officials were together in the building that was hit with several heavy munitions, according to The Times of Israel report.\n\nMeanwhile, the IDF said that top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr was killed in the Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday (local time).The IDF said Shukr was \"responsible for the majority of Hezbollah's most advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs\" and for the terror group's \"force build-up, planning, and execution of terror attacks against the State of Israel,\" The Times of Israel reported.\n\nOn July 30, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his nation has delivered \"crushing blows\" to enemies in the last few days, CNN reported. He made the remarks hours after the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.

To get the newsletter in your inbox every Monday, subscribe here.)\n\nPalestinian militant group Hamas on July 31 announced that its political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an Israeli strike in Iran, where he was attending the high-profile inaugural ceremony of the country's new president.\n\nThe exact circumstances of his assassination remain unclear, amid contradictory claims from Iran and the Western media. Meanwhile, On August 1, the Israeli military announced that it believed Mohammed Deif, the head of Hamas's military wing, was also killed in an air strike in southern Gaza on July 13.\n\nThe developments have heightened fears of the West Asian crisis escalating further, with tensions between Iran and Israel rising. All this, while civilian casualties continue to increase in Gaza - now totalling close to 40,000 deaths, including 15,000 children - as Israel's mindless violence persists. The rising death toll is now familiar headline, as the world appears to have grown increasingly numb to an ongoing massacre.\n\nTo appreciate the gravity of the recent deaths and their possible impact on West Asia and beyond, read our in-depth coverage and analysis of the developments. Who was Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas leader who was killed in Iran? Our Foreign Affairs Editor Stanly Johny tells us his story.\n\nHaniyeh was seen as the overall leader of Hamas, though it was not clear how much authority he could exercise over Hamas in Gaza. Like Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Haniyeh was also involved with Hamas's radical operations in the late 1980s and got arrested several times by the Israelis. Three of Haniyeh's sons - Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad - were killed on April 10 when an Israeli air strike struck the car they were driving, Hamas said. Haniyeh also lost four of his grandchildren, three girls and a boy, in the attack, according to a Hamas statement. Haniyeh was arguably the most powerful leader of Hamas after Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi.\n\nWhat does Haniyeh's death mean for Israel-Iran rivalry?\n\nThe fact that the IRGC blamed Israel for the attack itself is indicative that Iran would retaliate. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also vowed revenge. Tensions on Israel's northern border with Lebanon are already high with the latest rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah, Lebanon's powerful Shia militant group.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is what Iran and Hezbollah will do, and how Israel might respond. West Asia is dangerously close to an all-out war, warns Stanly Johny.\n\nDespite statements from the U.S., Gulf, and other countries on the recent killings, why is India's Ministry of External Affairs silent? Our Diplomatic Affairs Editor Suhasini Haidar spoke to experts to unpack India's apparent dilemma.\n\nHowever, India on August 2 issued an updated advisory for Indians living in Israel, asking them to avoid \"unnecessary travel\" and to stay vigilant in light of the \"prevailing security situation\".\n\nCarnage closer to home\n\nBangladesh is braced for another tense day as student protestors asked the public to join a \"Long March to Dhaka\" on August 5, a day after nearly 100 people died in fierce clashes between demonstrators demanding Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation, and the ruling party supporters.\n\nAmid the fresh wave of deadly street violence, India on has strongly advised all its nationals presently residing in Bangladesh to exercise \"extreme caution\" and restrict their movements.\n\nOur correspondent Kallol Bhattacherjee has been closely tracking developments in Bangladesh, ever since the student protests began in late July. In our weekly profiles, he wrote about the Awami League, Bangladesh's ruling party that built itself up through mass protests and played a central role in the liberation of the country from Pakistan and in ending military dictatorship later.\n\nOn the significance of the latest protests, he says they are indicative of a new break in the country's history and the huge challenge the Awami League is facing.

When asked to comment on Haniyeh's assassination, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken peddled in plausible deniability claiming the US was not aware of or involved in the murder of Haniyeh.\n\nThis is not the first time Israel has killed top Hamas leaders. Only this past January Israeli drones killed Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut. He was Deputy Chairman of Hamas' political bureau.

What Israel and its supporters don't understand is that you can't kill your way out of a moral failing - the unjust subjugation of the Palestinians.\n\nThis assassination of the head of the political bureau of Hamas, and the killing of Hezbollah's most senior military commander, is Israel's desperate attempt to divert attention from its huge losses in Gaza and its north, to reestablish its lost deterrence capability and to convince itself that it's not falling apart as a society, government and state.\n\nThe country has been roiled by demonstrations over judicial reforms, over divisions among secular and religious Jews and now over Prime Minister Netanyahu's handling of the War on Gaza approaching its tenth month. None of Israel's stated goals of destroying Hamas, returning its captives or providing security for its citizens have been achieved - and no viable plan for how Gaza is to be administered when the war ends.\n\nIn the meantime, its military is exhausted, its weaponry and munitions damaged and depleted, its economy battered, its standing in the world at an all-time low and its political system in disarray. Recently far right Israelis overran a military base to protest the detention of soldiers arrested on allegations of raping a Palestinian prisoner. It's but one incident of depravity in a long list of inhumane treatment of Palestinians.\n\nInstead of some serious soul-searching Israeli leaders seem to believe that by assassinating Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas will weaken in its negotiating posture over release of Israeli captives for the thousands of Palestinians held and abused in Israeli prisons. They fail to see the Palestinian resistance for what it is - an indigenous national liberation movement.\n\nIt is ironic.\n\nIsrael assassinated Ahmed Yasin 20 years ago. A wheelchair-ridden quadriplegic, Yasin was the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas. Although sentenced to life he was released a few years earlier due to a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Amman, Jordan of the then head of Hamas' political bureau, Khalid Mishal. Israel at the time thought it had dealt a death blow to Hamas.\n\nIn a generational span of twenty years, it is safe to say that nearly all of those Hamas fighters who burst out of Gaza into their ancestral lands on October 7th were infants and young children traumatized by Israel's relentless onslaughts of the blockaded enclave, and inspired by the ailing quadriplegic's martyrdom.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh is similarly loved by Palestinians and millions around the world. Before he was killed, three of his sons had been killed and more of his direct family were killed in the latest massacre of Gaza's civilian population. He handled their deaths with humility and dignity. He said that his family members were no less precious than the thousands of Palestinians who had lost their lives in quest of freedom from occupation.\n\nThrough his death he is setting another example of martyrdom and resistance for a new generation of Palestinian children traumatized by Israel's civilian killing machine. Over 16,000 children have been killed since October of last year, with thousands missing and presumed dead and decaying under the rubble.\n\nYes, in America, most will read about Ismail Haniyeh's assassination and consider him a terrorist. For a reality check, they should read the op-ed he penned in the Washington Post nearly two decades ago. The initial intention of the mainstream media to publish over a half dozen Hamas op-eds was ostensibly to expose the extremism of the movement - and to bolster its dwindling readership numbers. When the op-eds proved effective, the Washington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles Times refused to publish for them again.\n\nIn those op-eds Hamas leaders consistently focused on the original injustices of 1948, yet demonstrated the movement's pragmatism and willingness to negotiate a two-state solution based on equity and fairness. The concentrated media was determined to censor any position that did not fully support Israel's policies of land theft and ethnic cleansing. Thus, Americans were deprived of assessing the facts for themselves.\n\nIn the 2006 Washington Post op-ed the then Prime Minister Haniyeh questioned \"Surely the American people grow weary of this folly, after 50 years and $160 billion in taxpayer support for Israel's war-making capacity - its \"defense.\" Some Americans, I believe, must be asking themselves if all this blood and treasure could not have bought more tangible results for Palestine if only U.S. policies had been predicated from the start on historical truth, equity and justice.\"\n\nNow, after some 70 years, over 200 billion in tax payer dollars and over 40,000 murdered Palestinians, surely Americans grow weary of the dangers a desperate Israel poses for the US and the region? Two political leaders awaiting International Criminal Court warrants for war crimes. One is dead and the other lives on with impunity. Who will reign in PM Netanyahu and his rogue state if it's not Israel's benefactor?\n\nIt will be the next generation of traumatized Palestinian children who will look to October 7 and its aftermath as inspiration to finally put an end to Israel's occupation of Palestine.", "source": {"uri": "original.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Antiwar.com Original"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

This week, we look at more sympathetic media reporting on Hamas and cover more media misses.\n\nAttention Reporters: There's Nothing Moderate about Hamas\n\nIsrael's latest attacks on Hamas will not permanently wipe the group out, the New York Times reports. Instead, the group may gather itself and come back \"more radicalized.\"\n\n\"The assassinations of two Hamas leaders may be a short-term setback, analysts say, not enough to prevent the group from re-emerging intact -- and possibly more radicalized,\" a subheading reads.\n\n\"Israel's decades-long targeted killing campaigns against its Palestinian and regional rivals have a contested record: Critics have long argued the tactic has simply created room for new parties or leaders to emerge as Israel's main foes -- often with ever more radical forces replacing them,\" the story goes on to explain.\n\nHow, exactly, this group could become any more radical than it already is remains a mystery. It's been just ten months since Hamas killed 1,200 people and took nearly 250 hostages during its infamous October 7 terrorist attacks against Israel.\n\nBut the article continues a line of rhetoric seen in several recent obituaries of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who has been described by a handful of outlets as \"moderate.\"\n\nHaniyeh was killed during a visit to Tehran. While no one has claimed credit for the attack, Israel is believed to have been behind the Hamas leader's death. A separate New York Times report suggests Haniyeh was killed by an explosive device that was \"covertly smuggled into the Tehran guesthouse where he was staying.\" The bomb had reportedly been stashed in the guesthouse two months before its detonation.\n\nReuters reported, \"Tough-talking Haniyeh was seen as the more moderate face of Hamas.\" But after receiving backlash, it amended the headline to read: \"Who was Ismail Haniyeh and why is his assassination a blow to Hamas?\"\n\nYet the story still says that Haniyeh was seen as a \"moderate,\" and it calls him \"relatively pragmatic\" compared with other Hamas leaders. He was \"the tough-talking face of the Palestinian group's international diplomacy,\" the obituary says.\n\nThe Guardian, meanwhile, said Haniyeh was a \"moderate figure within the [Hamas] movement, one whose role had become vital in sustained diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire.\"\n\nAnd the BBC reported on Haniyeh's \"pragmatic\" ways and \"tough rhetoric.\"\n\nHere at National Review, readers could find an appropriate message about the death of the terror group's leader: \"Good riddance.\"\n\nAs NR's editors wrote:\n\nWhile branded as a \"moderate\" by the media, that was a relative term, as he still was committed to Hamas's goal of destroying Israel, supported their terrorist attacks, and helped raise money from Iran to further their objective. He condemned the U.S. killing of Osama bin Laden and was seen on video celebrating the October 7 attacks as they were unfolding. In a speech in January, he said, \"We should hold on to the victory that took place on October 7 and build upon it.\"\n\nMedia watchdog Honest Reporting also quickly refuted reporting that there was anything \"moderate\" about the Hamas leader, who as stated above, could be seen on video saying \"God is Good\" in response to the October 7 terrorist attack.\n\nCNN reported that Haniyeh had \"felt the personal toll of the war in Gaza,\" explaining that Israeli airstrikes had killed three of his sons and four of his grandchildren. And yet, CNN writes, \"Haniyeh insisted their deaths would not affect ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks.\"\n\n\"Whoever thinks that by targeting my kids during the negotiation talks and before a deal is agreed upon that it will force Hamas to back down on its demands is delusional,\" he said at the time.\n\nYet the real reason why is chilling. After the October 7 attack, he appeared on television to say: \"The blood of the children, women and elderly . . . we need this blood so that it will ignite within us the spirit of revolution, so that it will arouse within us persistence, so that it will arouse within us defiance and advance . . .\"\n\nHaniyeh also promised the group would \"lead Intifada after Intifada until we liberate Palestine.\"\n\nAnd then there's the time he said the quiet part out loud: \"The time has come for jihad of the swords; this is the battle for Jerusalem and the al-Aqsa mosque, and not the battle of the Palestinian people, or Gaza, or the people in Gaza.\"\n\nIn that same speech, he called for financial donations to support jihad, which he called even more important than humanitarian aid. \"Dear brothers and sisters, let us call this 'financial Jihad' . . . despite the immense importance and Gaza's need for any aid it can get. This Is financial Jihad . . . the notion of waging Jihad with one's life and one's money.\"", "source": {"uri": "ruthfullyyours.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ruthfullyyours.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_king@ruthfullyyours.com", "name": "Ruth King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Review", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Review"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeted_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Targeted killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

The anticipated Iranian responses against Israel, presumed to be behind the assassination, add to the turmoil. Israel, however, has not officially claimed responsibility for the assassination, seemingly to nullify any justifications for an Iranian retaliation, which could then be framed as an unprovoked attack by Iran. This incident has also sent shockwaves through Iranian militias, not least because it occurred in Tehran -- an epicenter of decision-making, now exposed as vulnerable. This breach in Tehran's security raises alarming concerns about spying at the highest echelons, affecting the broader security framework of Iran's militias. Given this precarious balance, the Iranian response may serve more to distract the militias with the notion of retaliation rather than addressing the fundamental security lapses troubling Tehran's political hierarchy. Thus, any action by these militias may aim more at obscuring the details of the assassination than addressing it head-on. However, regardless of Iran's possible response, it will not alter the Palestinian dynamics, which are set to enter a complex phase that could diminish Iran's influence in Palestinian affairs moving forward. In the aftermath of Haniyeh's assassination, the political landscape in Gaza is the first to feel the tremors. Discussions about an upcoming truce and the future of Gaza post-conflict have shifted dramatically. Prime Minister Netanyahu, unburdened by concerns over hostages, now holds additional strategic advantages following a series of high-profile strikes against Hamas and Hezbollah, reinforcing his standing in Israeli domestic politics. Netanyahu's December 2023 ultimatum -- that Hamas must surrender or face destruction -- remains pivotal, especially after reinforcing it through multiple assassinations, including that of a senior Hezbollah military figure. For Hamas, the war's continuation with the loss of key military leaders and the risk to political leaders abroad places heavy pressure on the Qassam Brigades in Gaza, now shouldering the burden of decision-making alone. This scenario likely forces Hamas to contemplate a future in Gaza stripped of military control, a significant blow that would reduce it to a political entity devoid of substantial military power. This is a difficult crossroads for the Qassam Brigades, which face mounting internal and external pressures, making the concept of post-war Gaza highly relevant in forthcoming negotiations. Abroad, Hamas faces challenges not only in security but also in its political role, particularly in Lebanon. If an official war between Hezbollah and Israel breaks out, leading to a political settlement, Hezbollah's presence in southern Lebanon would likely be diminished. Hamas, similarly, may find itself relegated to a purely political role in Lebanon, maintaining military strength primarily in the West Bank, shifting towards covert operations. The potential loss of Gaza presents an uncertain future for Hamas, raising questions about its political relevance and capacity for restructuring. On the Palestinian Authority's front, the possibility that Hamas might lose Gaza without securing a political agreement poses a substantial challenge. The Israeli stance opposing the full return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza complicates the prospect of unifying Gaza and the West Bank, straining relations between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. Hamas would need the Palestinian Authority to maintain political relevance, which might require significant concessions, compelling Hamas to reconsider its ideology and approach profoundly. The assassination of Haniyeh, following closely on the heels of other key Gaza military leaders, marks a critical juncture as it occurred amid vital negotiations between Hamas and Israel, and an attempt to recalibrate the Palestinian political landscape. This assassination underscores the movement's need to identify a secure locale and formulate an acceptable political agenda. Notably, the Oslo Accords emerged not immediately after the PLO's exodus from Beirut but were catalyzed by the Intifada, which paved the way for the Palestinian Authority's establishment. In contrast, Hamas now faces the challenge of defining its future trajectory and political strategy in a fractured environment. The looming Iranian response and the prospect of Hezbollah's military engagement further contribute to an evolving equation, likely resulting in a diminished Iranian and Hezbollah role in the Palestinian issue moving forward. -- Ayman Khaled (translated by Asaf Zilberfarb)", "source": {"uri": "themedialine.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Media Line"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oslo Accords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Lebanon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Lebanon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestine Liberation Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://themedialine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164107597-e1722526971980.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Deif was targeted in a strike at Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade commander Rafa'a Salameh's compound in Khan Younis area on July 13, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nA day later, the IDF confirmed the death of Salameh.

The accusations led to a number of Western countries freezing funds for the agency, including the UK, which then reversed its decision under Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nThe announcement comes as Israel sent troops to bolster its borders with the West Bank to prepare for a possible ground assault orchestrated by Hamas and Iran.\n\nAdditional forces were deployed to cities to foil any infiltration attempt, following a deadly knife attack on Sunday that left two people killed in the city of Holon in central Israel, Israel's Army Radio, run by the armed forces, reported.\n\nIt came amid frantic diplomatic efforts to prevent regional war as Iran was preparing to launch a major revenge attack against Israel.\n\nThe US commander of its Middle East forces arrived in Israel for talks on \"joint preparation\" on Monday, while US warships moved closer to Israel to help defend the ally.\n\nIran cleared the skies of commercial planes in parts of the country, much as it did before a similar large-scale attack in April. Tehran also called a crisis meeting of Arab states on Wednesday, suggesting its attack may come later in the week.\n\nIran also hosted a close ally of Vladimir Putin on Monday. Russia has criticised Israel for assassinating the Hamas leader Ismael Haniyeh in Tehran last week and has grown closer to Iran since the war with Ukraine.\n\nTehran has dismissed attempts by Arab nations and the US to de-escalate the situation, saying it will attack Israel even if it means sparking a war, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nNasser Kanaani, the Iranian foreign ministry's spokesman, reiterated on Monday that an attack was being prepared, saying: \"We believe Iran is entitled to punish the aggressor within the framework of international law.\"\n\nIn Gaza on Monday, Israel continued to attack Hamas, killing Hamas minister of economy, Abdel Al Zeriei, as well as a battalion commander in Hamas's Gaza City Brigade.\n\nBut a CNN report published on Monday cast doubt on the IDF's destruction of Hamas military capabilities.\n\nNearly half of Hamas's battalions in northern and central Gaza have rebuilt themselves despite nearly 10 months of Israeli pummeling, the report said.\n\nThe research shows that as of July 1, only three of Hamas's 24 battalions have been destroyed. Among the reasons are the group's ability to replenish their ranks, make effective use of scarce resources and employ guerilla tactics.\n\n\"The Israelis would say that they cleared a place, but ... they haven't defeated these fighters at all,\" said Brian Carter who led the joint research. \"[Hamas] are ready to fight and want to fight.\"\n\nHamas, backed and funded by Iran, is thought to have started the war in Gaza with 30,000 fighters. So far around 39,623 Palestinians have been killed, according to Hamas.\n\nThe IDF also rejected the findings as a whole.\n\n\"The majority of Hamas brigades have been dismantled, and most battalions are at a low level of readiness, meaning they cannot function as a military framework,\" it said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

It is understood that there are legitimate grounds for debate about the border between Israel and the ostensibly Palestinian entity that could be established next to it in the West Bank and Gaza, with some connection between them. Violence that constitutes border skirmishing begets an equivalent level of violence in return. Acts of outright terrorism directed by Israel's enemies at its civilian population have traditionally been construed by Israel as justifying the killing of the leader of the terrorist organization responsible for the attack.\n\nHamas acted under instructions from Iran in carrying out its terrorist invasion of Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. It was not a border skirmish, but an act of war accompanied by rhetorical flourishes that confirmed that Hamas does not and will never accept the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. The Hamas leadership clearly knew that Israel would reply with a massive and sustained attack on Hamas in Gaza, and that the lives of the Hamas leaders were apt to be the subject of mortal attack from Israeli intelligence and special forces.\n\nIt is a tense and difficult time. All wars are terribly destructive and cruel, but it is clear that Israel has both the ability and the will to eliminate Hamas as a terrorist organization. With or without the assistance of the United States and other powers, Israel will act to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear military power. Escalation of hostilities by Iran and through its proxies, which include the Houthis in Yemen, will attract the full destructiveness of Israeli air power as well as counter-terrorist activities against the lives of the leaders of Iran and its terrorist apparatus. The imponderable is the point at which the long-suffering masses of Iran, who rightly detest their government, can undermine the loyalty of the forces of repression in that country.\n\nThe clear pattern is that Israel, as the Jews have had to do so often, is carrying the burden for civilization, made more onerous by the wafflings and evasions of Washington, but the end of the road is not far off. The end is the undisputed acceptance of the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state and in a condition of civilized coexistence with its neighbours.\n\nThe assassination of Ismail Haniyeh was a very positive development, and so will be its sequels if they are provoked and needed. Israel has made the point that no target of the justified wrath of Israel is safe.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mossad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casus_belli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casus belli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proxy war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/05/id5700081-GettyImages-2107841976-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795792", "eventUri": "eng-9795792", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 105, "relevance": 1}

Abbas and the PA have also once again served as a reminder that they share the same goal as Hamas: glorify terrorism and destroy Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority (PA) should have been happy over the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the political bureau of the Iran-backed Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nPA President Mahmoud Abbas appears to have forgotten that Haniyeh represents a group that carried out a violent and brutal coup against his loyalists in the Gaza Strip back in 2007.\n\nInstead, the PA and its leaders have been mourning the death of Haniyeh, who was killed during a visit to Tehran on July 31. They have, in addition, used the assassination to step up their incitement against Israel.\n\nThe Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) reported in 2007 that at least 161 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 wounded during fighting between Hamas on one side and members of Abbas's security forces and Fatah faction on the other. According to the PCHR:\n\n\"[T]he two parties of the conflict perpetrated grave breaches of the provisions of international law concerning internal armed conflicts, especially common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The fighting included: extra-judicial and willful killings of combatants who laid down their arms; killing a number of wounded persons inside hospitals; abduction and torture; using houses and apartment buildings in the fighting, endangering the lives of civilians; obstruction of access of medical and civil defense crews to areas of clashes.\"\n\nIn response to the 2007 coup, Abbas denounced Hamas leaders as \"traitors\" and called on the terrorist group to apologize for the fighting in the Gaza Strip. He accused Hamas of \"killings and massacres,\" as well as being behind a plot to assassinate him during a visit to the Gaza Strip.\n\nAbbas also seems to have forgotten the number of times Hamas leaders condemned him as a \"traitor\" for meeting with Israelis and purportedly expressing a desire to make peace with Israel. When Abbas attended the funeral of late Israeli President Shimon Peres in 2016, Hamas condemned the move as \"a betrayal of Palestinian blood.\"\n\nA year later, senior Hamas official Marwan Abu Ras described Abbas as \"the biggest traitor in the history of the Palestinian cause\" and called for executing him in a public square in the Gaza Strip.\n\nFor Abbas, Haniyeh and Hamas were not only political rivals, but ferocious enemies as well. In 2017, Abbas imposed a series of sanctions on Hamas, including refusal to pay for the electricity Israel supplies to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, as well as slashing funding for the coastal enclave and cutting salaries of thousands of PA employees.\n\nSince the 2007 coup, Abbas has avoided setting foot in the Gaza Strip out of fear that Hamas would murder him. His aides have accused Hamas of plotting to assassinate him during the same year. They revealed that four large explosive devices were uncovered by Abbas's security officers on a road where his convoy was about to pass through the northern Gaza Strip. Upon discovering the devices, Abbas's security officers instructed him to return to Ramallah, the de facto capital of the Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nThis same Abbas is now crying over the death of Haniyeh. Almost immediately after the news of the death of the Hamas leader broke, Abbas was quick to issue a statement \"strongly condemning the cowardly assassination of the great leader Ismail Haniyeh.\" The statement was followed by another in which Abbas \"declared a day of mourning in protest of the assassination\" of Haniyeh. Abbas also ordered that \"flags be flown at half-mast in official Palestinian institutions.\" As if that were not enough, Abbas late that day phoned Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal to offer his condolences over the assassination of the \"great national leader Ismail Haniyeh.\"\n\nOne of Abbas's top aides, Hussein al-Sheikh, also mourned the death of the Hamas leader:\n\n\"I called our brother [Hamas leader] Khaled Mashaal by phone and offered him warm condolences on the martyrdom of the head of the [Hamas] Political Bureau, the national leader Ismail Haniyeh, whose martyrdom constituted a great loss for the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration evidently considers both Abbas and al-Sheikh as legitimate leaders and partners for a future peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. For the past four years, Biden administration officials have been meeting with the two on a regular basis. On May 20, 2024, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with al-Sheikh and PA Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, who has also been shedding tears over the killing of the \"great\" Hamas leader.\n\nIn addition to exposing the Palestinian Authority's duplicity, all this grieving over Haniyeh, its bitter adversary, should serve as a warning to the Biden-Harris administration and those who continue to talk about the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. They must be reminded that Haniyeh, who is being praised by Abbas and the PA as a \"great leader,\" belongs to a group that has long been waging a Jihad (holy war) to murder Jews and destroy Israel - and that does not have the slightest intention of being \"revitalized.\"\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration and other supporters of the \"two-state solution\" also need to be reminded that Haniyeh was the first Palestinian leader to celebrate the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the murder of 1,200 Israelis and the abduction of more than 240 others.\n\nDuring the attack, Israelis and others were beheaded, raped, tortured, and burned alive. In a video broadcast by Al-Jazeera, the Qatari-owned mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood organization and its affiliate Hamas, Haniyeh is seen leading a prayer of thanks over the October 7 atrocities.\n\nBy hailing Haniyeh as a \"great leader,\" Abbas and his PA cohorts are sending a message to all Palestinians that the murderous Hamas leader is their role model. It is no wonder, then, that thousands of Palestinians took to the streets of the PA-controlled areas of the West Bank, including Ramallah, to mourn the killing of Haniyeh and voice support for Hamas murderers and rapists. It is no wonder that Hamas remains extremely popular among the Palestinians.\n\nIt is obvious why Abbas has not condemned the October 7 massacres against Israelis: he respects the \"great\" leader of the murderers and rapists and has even observed a day of mourning for the killing of Haniyeh. If you are so fond of the slain Hamas mass-murderer, it shows that you support the atrocities of October 7.\n\nAbbas and other Palestinian Authority leaders have once again demonstrated their preference to ally with Islamist terror groups such as Hamas rather than to secure a brighter future for their own people. Abbas and the PA have also once again served as a reminder that they share the same goal as Hamas: glorify terrorism and destroy Israel.", "source": {"uri": "ruthfullyyours.com", "dataType": "news",

Nor has it led to the weakening of strong Arab resistance movements like Hamas in Gaza or Hizbullah in Lebanon.\n\nLast week in the span of less than 24 hours, Israel assassinated the second in command of Hizbullah, Fouad Shukr, in the movement's stronghold in south Beirut in Lebanon and the leader of the Political Bureau of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in, of all places, Tehran, where he was attending the official inauguration of the newly elected Iranian president.\n\nTwo days later, the Israeli army announced that it had received intelligence confirmation that the military commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of Hamas, Mohamed Deif, had been killed in a prior Israeli attack on 13 July.\n\nIt goes without saying that these assassinations could boost the morale of the Israeli people to a degree for a limited time and give them a false sense of security. However, in the long run they will prove ineffective in stemming the will of the resistance and the determination of the Palestinians and the Arabs in challenging and fighting Israeli forces.\n\nHamas is a case in point. The Israelis assassinated the founder of this movement, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in 2004. They also attempted to poison the former head of the Hamas Political Bureau, Khaled Meshaal, in Amman in 1997, and had it not been for warnings from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who managed to deliver an antidote, Meshaal would have died.\n\nAlso on the list of assassinated Hamas leaders figure Mahmoud Al-Zaher, Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantisi, and the well-known bomb-maker Imad Mughnieh. After the attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year, Israel assassinated Marwan Eissa, a Hamas military commander, on 10 March this year, Ossama Al-Mezeiny, the former speaker of Hamas' Shura Council, and Azzam (\"the Bald\") on 2 January, along with Salah Al-Arouri, a former deputy of the chairman of the Political Bureau of Hamas. This is not an exhaustive list.\n\nWithin the ranks of Hizbullah, in addition to Shukr the Israelis assassinated Wessam Al-Taweel, a commander of the Al-Radwan Force on 8 January, Mohamed Nasser, a commanding officer of the Al-Aziz Force, on 3 July, and Sami Abdallah, the commanding officer of the Al-Nasr Battalion.\n\nOne of the lessons that the Israelis have not learned from the 7 October attacks is that despite the \"elimination\" - the Israeli word for those who have been assassinated - of some prominent leaders within Hamas, the movement was still able to carry out the large-scale attacks against the south of Israel last October. Its fighters brought back 250 hostages from Israel in attacks that cost the lives of 1,200 Israelis.\n\nThe assassination of Haniyeh in Tehran has raised the spectre of a major military conflagration in the Middle East. At time of writing, Israel is in a heightened state of readiness waiting for Iranian reprisals, and several major airlines have suspended flights to Tel Aviv.\n\nUS President Joe Biden called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the assassination of Haniyeh to reaffirm the \"ironclad\" support of the US for the security of Israel against Iranian threats, while calling for a speedy ceasefire agreement in Gaza that would lead to the release of the hostages and pointing out that Israel would be on its own if it chose to escalate its attacks in the form of further assassinations.\n\nPerhaps the Israelis will pause for a while before going after Palestinian leaders in Hamas, senior officials and military commanders in Hizbullah, or commanders in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps operating in Syria. It has been reported that Israel has Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah in its sights and could target him if a political decision orders it. Maybe Biden had this in mind when he warned Netanyahu that the US will not come to Israel's aid if it decides to escalate its attacks.\n\nHowever, there is nothing on the horizon that indicates that Netanyahu is in a mood to de-escalate anytime soon. After his trip to Washington in July and the warm welcome he received from members of Congress during his remarks before a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate, he believes there is no need to do so. This is in addition to his separate meetings with Biden, Vice-President Kamala Harris as the presumptive nominee of the Democrats in the forthcoming US presidential elections, and former president Donald Trump.\n\nFrom his standpoint, this was a triumphant trip during which he made the most of the highly polarised political scene in the US and the ill-timed and ill-advised US support for the unjust and devastating war that he has unleashed against not only the Palestinians in Gaza but also Israel's neighbours in the region, if only indirectly.\n\nOne thing is certain: more targeted assassinations and the perpetual use of force and threats of the use of force by Israel will not dent the will, determination, and perseverance of the Palestinians and of the Iranian-backed Hizbullah from confronting Israel militarily until it realises that regional security is not a zero-sum game.\n\nUntil that day comes, the Middle East, because of Israel, will remain in a state of near-perpetual war.\n\nThe writer is former assistant foreign minister.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

Our people will remain committed to our national unity and will follow the path of jihad, resistance and restoring our rights. The loss of our brother (Haniyeh) is great, but our enemies do not know that the blood of the martyrs shortens the path to freedom and victory.\"stated Meshall .\n\nIsrael was established in violation all laws on the robbed Palestinian lands by US,UK, and Europe to serve as their killing machine to destabilize Middle East Thus history of Israel is history of massacres and genocides of Palestinians.\n\nAs pointed out by WSWS website Haniyeh's killing was aimed at humiliating Iran, destabilizing its leadership, undermining confidence in its security forces and forcing it to respond, providing Israel with a pretext for still more aggression.\n\nIsmail Hainyeh, chief negotiator in the protracted, on-again off-again Gaza war peace negotiations to end savagery unleashed by Netanyahu described as the butcher in chief . For an Israeli government that is pursuing genocide and is responsible -- according to The Lancet, one of the world's leading medical journals -- for at least 186,000 deaths during the Gaza War, there are truly no limits. Still, the execution of Haniyeh, represents a new level of lawlessness and brutality in international relations.\n\nIn killing Ismail Haniyeh Netanyahu killed the fraudulent peace talks which US and Europe exploited to give enough time to Israel to slaughter Palestinians and destroy Gaza.\n\n\"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side?\" rightly asked Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who has hosted the peace negotiations.\n\nDescribing Israel as a nihilist state Scottish author, human rights campaigner, journalist, and former diplomat. Craig Murray said 'the apartheid state appears to have no objective other than violence and an urge for desolation. For me it is now axiomatic that there is no two state solution and that apartheid Israel must be completely dismantled as an entity. I believe that more and more people around the entire globe believe that now. And if we have to dismantle our own political and media classes to get there, so be it.\n\nHe added that Israel has also taken a policy decision that the mass rape of detainees by soldiers -- and, somewhat strangely, homosexual rape in particular -- is acceptable in war and not to be punished.\n\nIronically Israel has also underlined its genocidal intent in Gaza by proving that it has the technical ability to carry out targeted attacks, and that the flattening of entire cities with 2,000lb bombs and the massacre of tens of thousands of innocents has been a policy choice.\n\nThe Western media appears paralyzed by this. I have seen virtually no serious comment or analysis. Nor has anybody pointed out the contrast between Israel's lies about mass rape on Oct. 7 and Israel's now-admitted policy of tolerating rape of detainees.\n\nThe political class seems even more paralyzed than the media class. Caught in their commitment to Zionism -- basically bought and paid for - they have nothing to say about these incredible events more sensible than Kamala Harris' zombie-like incantation of \"Israel's right to self-defence.\"\n\nThe British Foreign Office has failed to produce its promised considered reaction to the ICJ Opinion on the illegality of Israeli occupation, let alone responded sensibly to Israel's crazed paroxysm of destruction this week. said Craig Murray\n\nIsrael's fascist ministers were openly jubilant. Though condemned the killing, Israeli stooge Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas can't be unhappy at the killing of Ismail Haniyeh as in the case of Saudi, Egyptian, Jordanian and UAE complicit in the slaughter of Palestinians . Abbas who attended Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres' funeral failed to attend Ismail Haniyeh's funeral.\n\nBritish columnist David Hearst said Netanyahu is trying to drag Iran and Hezbollah into a regional war that his army has no chance of winning .In killing Ismail Haniyeh, Netanyahu has sent the clearest message yet to Iran and the resistance movements that he wants a regional war.\n\nPalestinian journalist and media consultant Ramzy Baroud, said Haniyeh, has succeeded in forging and strengthening ties with Russia, China and other countries beyond the US-Western political domain.\n\nBy killing Haniyeh, a political leader who has essentially served the role of a diplomat, Israel demonstrated the extent of its desperation and the limits of its military failure. Considering the criminal extent to which Israel is willing to go, such desperation could eventually lead to the regional war that Israel has been trying to instigate, even before the Gaza war.\n\nHailing from a family of refugees expelled from al-Jura, which today makes up part of the Israeli port city of Ashkelon in historic Palestine during the Nakba in 1948 , Haniyeh was born in Gaza in 1962 at Al-Shati, where he was raised. Al Shati is one of eight camps for Palestinian refugees established by the United Nations for Palestinians in the aftermath of the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948, known to Palestinians as the Nakba when 750,000 people were forced from their homes during the war that led to the creation of the artificial fascist state of Israel\n\nWhen the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, was born out of the womb of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood organisation in December 1987,Haniyeh was about 25 years. Yet, like many of his Islamic comrades, he was born a leader. He ascended through the ranks of Hamas, starting as the secretary to the group's founder, Ahmed Yassin, and eventually leading its political bureau. Haniyeh served as the fourth Palestinian prime minister and the third political leader of Hamas\n\nThroughout his youth, Haniyeh developed a close relationship with Hamas's founder and spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin. Haniyeh became his personal secretary. Following the assassination of Yassin and his successor, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, in 2004, Haniyeh became one of the group's senior leaders.\n\n***\n\nLatheef Farook-Senior journalist based in

Using the environment created after Operation \"Flood,\" Israel has continued to attempt to provoke a military confrontation between Iran and the United States.\n\nIn this context, Israel has carried out several actions deemed openly provocative by Tehran. First, on December 25 of last year, Israel launched three missiles from the occupied Golan Heights, assassinating Sayyed Razi Mousavi, who was responsible for supporting the resistance in Syria. Mousavi, who had previously been identified on July 4, 2022, by Israel's Channel 14 as \"the director of the office of communication between Damascus and Tehran and the brain behind the transfer of equipment from Damascus to ammunition storage facilities in Syria or to Hezbollah in Lebanon,\" was the target of this attack. Iran interpreted this assassination as the first attempt to draw Tehran into the battlefield. General Esmail Qaani stated, \"They assassinate martyr Razi Mousavi because they could not achieve anything on the Gaza battlefield, and Iran will not fall into their traps.\"\n\nThe second act of provocation occurred on April 1, when the Iranian consulate in Damascus, located next to the embassy, was attacked with six missiles fired from F-35 aircraft. In this attack, Mohammad Reza Zahedi, the third-in-command of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, died, making him the most significant figure to be assassinated since Commander Qasem Soleimani's death.\n\nThe most recent military attack by Israel against Iran was the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas's political bureau in Tehran. According to the third statement from the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, \"The attack was carried out with a short-range projectile with a warhead of approximately 7 kg, causing a violent explosion from outside the perimeter of the guest residence.\"\n\nThis strategy of targeted assassinations has been used by Israel for decades. The Mossad has a long history of targeting Palestinians and other opponents of Israel in Europe, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Iran. This same strategy is employed both in Gaza and in the West Bank. However, if the ultimate goal of this strategy of assassinations is to weaken the groups opposed to the colonization of Palestine, this strategy has failed and will continue to fail in the future. Every person assassinated has had a successor.\n\nThe Most Significant Assassination Operations by Israel\n\n1973: An Israeli operational team, led by Ehud Barak, who would later become Prime Minister of Israel, conducted an attack in Beirut. During this operation, Kamal Adwan, a member of the Palestinian National Council in the West Bank; Mohammed Yousef Najjar, an operative member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO); and Kamal Nasser, a prominent poet and spokesperson for the PLO, were assassinated. This attack was part of a series of killings of Palestinian leaders carried out by Israel following the events of the Munich Olympics.\n\n1988: In the late 1980s, Khalil al-Wazir, also known as \"Abu Jihad\" and a military leader of the PLO, was assassinated in Tunisia. Al-Wazir was Yasser Arafat's deputy in the PLO. The news of his assassination became public in 2012.\n\n1992: On February 16, Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi, one of the founders and the second Secretary-General of Hezbollah, was killed while traveling to Jibsheet to attend a commemorative ceremony. His convoy was attacked by Israeli helicopters, resulting in the deaths of Musawi, his wife, and his son.\n\n1995: On October 26, Fathi Shaqaqi, one of the founders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was assassinated in Malta by two motorcyclists. Shaqaqi had traveled to Libya to assess the situation of Palestinian refugees. Israel sought to weaken the opposition to the Oslo process, including the Islamic Jihad and Hamas.\n\n1996: On January 5, Israel executed the assassination of Yahya Ayyash, known as \"The Engineer,\" in an attempt to curb the rising operations of Hamas against Israel. Ayyash died when his mobile phone, rigged as a bomb, exploded. Following his death, Hamas intensified its attacks.\n\n1997: Israel attempted to assassinate Khaled Meshaal, one of Hamas' leaders, under the orders of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mishka Ben-David, head of the assassination team, described how agents prepared to use a poisonous spray against Meshaal. However, the intervention of Meshaal's daughter and the driver led to the agents being arrested by Jordanian authorities. Netanyahu negotiated with Jordan's King Hussein to release the Mossad agents and provide the antidote. King Hussein had threatened to cancel the recently signed peace treaty with Israel. Israel also had to release 20 Palestinian prisoners.\n\n2002: On July 22, Salah Shehada, the second military leader of Hamas, was killed in an Israeli airstrike with a one-ton bomb targeting the building where he lived with his wife and 14-year-old daughter. The attack left 150 civilians injured and caused several deaths.\n\n2004: Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and leader of Hamas, was assassinated in Gaza on March 22. Yassin had spent several years in Israeli prisons. He was arrested in 1983 and sentenced in 1989, but was released in 1997 in an agreement between Israel and King Hussein of Jordan. After prayer, while leaving the mosque, an Israeli helicopter attacked him, resulting in his death along with several of his companions. Ismail Haniyeh, then head of Sheikh Yassin's office, assumed leadership of Hamas. Shortly thereafter, Abdelaziz Rantisi was killed in an Israeli attack while traveling by car in Gaza on April 17, 2004. Rantisi, known for his staunch stance against Israel, died three days after a meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Gideon Meir, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, confirmed Israeli responsibility and warned that any successor to Rantisi would be a \"legitimate target.\"\n\n2008: Imad Mughnieh, a high-ranking military commander of Hezbollah, was killed in Damascus on February 12 in a joint operation by the CIA and Mossad. The attack was carried out with a bomb attached to his vehicle. Mughnieh was known as Hezbollah's military mastermind. His elimination did not halt the group's military progress. In 2015, his son, Jihad Mughnieh, was also killed in an Israeli airstrike.\n\n2010: Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a senior Hamas operative, was assassinated in his hotel room in Dubai by Mossad agents. Twenty-six Israeli agents, who entered Dubai with false passports and under the guise of tourists, were involved in the operation. Israeli authorities did not take responsibility for the attack. Al-Mabhouh was one of the founders of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, and played a crucial role in numerous operations against Israel.\n\n2010-2012: During this period, Iranian nuclear scientists became a primary operational target for Israel. In 2010, Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, an Iranian physics professor, was killed by a remote-controlled bomb placed in his car by a motorcyclist. That same year, Majid Shahriari, a nuclear engineer, was also assassinated in Tehran. In 2011 and 2012, two more Iranian scientists, Dariush Rezaei-Najad and Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan, were similarly targeted and killed.\n\n2023: Seyyed Reza Mousavi, a prominent commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), was assassinated in Syria while overseeing \"support to the resistance.\" Mousavi died as a result of an Israeli attack in the Zaynabiyah area of Damascus. He was one of the most experienced Iranian military figures in Syria and a close collaborator of Generals Qassem Soleimani and Mohammad Hejazi. The Israeli attack, carried out with three missiles launched from the Golan Heights, resulted in the death of the IRGC commander.\n\n2024: Israel conducted a drone attack in Beirut that resulted in the death of Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of Hamas' political bureau and the organization's leader in the West Bank. Al-Arouri, who had been released in 2007 after more than a decade of detention, was arrested again and released in 2010. In that year, he was appointed to Hamas' political bureau and rose to the position of vice president in 2017. In 2021, he became the leader of Hamas in the West Bank.\n\nThese operations reflect Israel's prolonged strategy of conducting targeted assassinations aimed at weakening its adversaries. While these tactics have succeeded in some cases, in many others, the targeted groups have managed to replace their leaders and, in some instances, even become stronger.\n\n2024: In April, an Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus resulted in the deaths of seven senior IRGC officials. Among the victims were General Mohammadreza Zahedi, commander of the Quds Force for Syria and Lebanon, and General Mohammadi Haji-Rahimi, his successor. This attack triggered Operation \"True Promise,\" a significant shift in Iranian strategy from \"strategic patience\" to \"active deterrence,\" in an attempt to respond directly to each Israeli attack on Iranian sovereignty.\n\nEscalation of the Conflict\n\nOperation \"True Promise\" marked a fundamental shift in Iran's strategy, moving from \"strategic patience\" to a policy of \"active deterrence.\" This change involved a direct response to each Israeli attack on Iranian sovereignty. In an unprecedented move, Iran launched a massive attack with over 300 ballistic and cruise missiles, complemented by kamikaze drones. Despite efforts by the United States, the United Kingdom, Jordan, and Israel to intercept most of the projectiles, some managed to hit occupied territory, causing damage to various military and intelligence facilities.\n\nThe attack on the morning of July 31 revealed that Iran's deterrent power had not yet been fully restored and demonstrated Israel's determination to continue the conflict and escalate tensions. This event occurred at a critical moment when diplomatic channels were reactivated to negotiate a ceasefire and prisoner exchange, and when Ismail Haniyeh, a prominent figure in the Palestinian resistance advocating for dialogue, was involved in the process.\n\nThe late leader of Hamas' political bureau had previously stated in an interview: \"Netanyahu does not want the Gaza war to end; rather, he seeks to expand the conflict into a regional war and hopes that the United States will join the military front against Iran, serving Israel's interests. The Zionist enemy is responsible for this escalation of regional tensions, the denial of our people's rights, the continued aggression against our people and sacred sites, especially Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa, and the continuation of the war and genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the Islamic Republic of Iran, responding to the recent Israeli aggression has become virtually inevitable given the scale of the attack on its own capital. In recent days, various local media have reported that Iran has informed several regional mediators that there will be no room for negotiation or moderation this time.\n\nOn its part, the United States, seen by Iran as Israel's main backer, is preparing to deploy combat aircraft to the West Asia region in an attempt to deter Iran. The Pentagon has sent a squadron of U.S. Air Force fighters to the region to bolster Israel's air force. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense has ordered the deployment of warships and destroyers to the area.\n\nThe United States is preparing to counter a potential attack, which could take the form of missile and drone offensives similar to those launched by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps on April 13. According to U.S. sources, these attacks could be more extensive than previous ones and might involve Hezbollah.\n\nThe Consequences of the Assassination of Ismail Haniyeh and Iran's Response\n\nIn conclusion, Israel's selective assassination policies, particularly the killing of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran during the inauguration ceremony of the new president Masud Pezeshkian, have crossed a red line for the Islamic Republic. This attack has generated a profound sense of humiliation in Iran, suggesting that the response will be proportional to the severity of the grievance.\n\nAs noted by political scientist and Hezbollah expert Amal Saad: \"It will be a massive and very likely coordinated response. I believe it will force Israel to reconsider its red lines, although it will not be sufficient to trigger a full-scale war.\"\n\nThe scenarios discussed in the Iranian press include the assassination of a high-ranking figure in Israel or a third country, or a specific attack within Israel. Indications suggest that Iran may not undertake a direct response through its Axis of Resistance allies, although they could become involved if the retaliatory operation has a broader scope than the previously mentioned \"True Promise.\"\n\nRecent Israeli attacks on Iraqi resistance groups, bombings in Yemen, and increased tensions with Hezbollah have raised the possibility of a joint response. These groups might support Iran in a coordinated action against Israel, further amplifying the regional crisis and exacerbating the already tense geopolitical situation.", "source": {"uri":

He emphasized that India being could leverage its relationships to stop the ongoing violence in the region.His call for action comes amid heightened tensions following deadly clashes and targeted strikes involving Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah.\n\nElahi underscored India's strategic importance and influence. He noted that India has maintained good diplomatic relations with Israel and has been a historical supporter of the Palestinian cause through its non-aligned movement. These factors position India uniquely to mediate and promote peace in West Asia, Elahi said in an interview with news agency ANI.\n\n\"Since the beginning of the tragic events and crimes of Israel in Gaza, I repeatedly mentioned that India is an important country, is a big power and influential country in the international community. Beside this, it has good relations with Israel and Iran and also India, as a non-aligned movement founder had supported Palestine case in the history of the region,\" said Elahi.\n\n\"So, there is an expectation that India can and should play more active role in the current crisis in the region and tensions in the region. You know, the government of India has very good relation with the ruling party in Israel and the government of Israel. So, it can use its influence to convince them to stop this genocide in the region and in Gaza and stop crimes and keep the peace in Palestine. From the Iranian side, we are in collaboration with India in many cases and we hope that, you know, we are trying to convince India to keep peace in the region,\" he added.\n\nThe current crisis intensified on October 7 when over 2000 Hamas terrorists breached Israeli borders. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 1200 Israelis and around 250 people being taken hostage, with approximately 120 still in Hamas captivity. In response, Israel launched a robust military offensive targeting Hamas in the Gaza Strip, prompting several nations to call for an immediate ceasefire amid escalating violence and casualties.\n\nAdding to the conflict's severity, Hamas' political bureau chief, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed on July 31 in Tehran. According to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Haniyeh was targeted in an attack on a residence designated for war veterans. He was in Tehran to attend the swearing-in ceremony of Iran's President-elect, Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nOn August 1, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the killing of Hamas military wing commander Mohammed Deif in an airstrike conducted on July 13 in the southern Gaza Strip. The announcement followed a confirmation of intelligence regarding Deif's death. The IDF stated that the strike, aimed at the commander of Hamas' Khan Younis Brigade, Rafa'a Salameh, resulted in Deif's elimination.\n\nIn the same announcement, the IDF mentioned that Salameh was also killed in the attack. They confirmed that the strike on Salameh's compound was highly effective, accurately targeting both Hamas officials present at the time.\n\nIn another related incident, the IDF reported the death of top Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in southern Lebanon. Shukr was noted for his responsibility over Hezbollah's advanced weaponry, including precise-guided missiles, cruise missiles, anti-ship missiles, long-range rockets, and UAVs. He played a major role in planning and executing terror attacks against Israel.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu highlighted recent successes against hostile forces, stating on July 30 that Israel delivered \"crushing blows\" to its enemies. His remarks came after the deaths of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

As the region now descends into further chaos, which could engulf the world, it is important to understand why this happened and what the US-Israeli strategy is.\n\nLast Tuesday, Israel launched an attack on southern Beirut, the Lebanese capital, killing 7 and injuring 80 others, including 3 children and two women. The building the Israeli Air Force struck, using drones and missiles fired from fighter jets, was a civilian populated tower and was reduced to mere rubble. Tel Aviv's primary target was a Hezbollah military leader called Fouad Shoukr, one of the groups most prominent military leaders, and he was killed alongside an Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) advisor in that building.\n\nOnly hours later, a shock report emerged from Iran. Ismail Hanniyeh, the head of the Hamas political wing, had been assassinated in a building located in Tehran, the Iranian Capital, after attending the inauguration of Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian. Hanniyeh, who had been advocating strongly for a ceasefire in Gaza and even announced that Hamas would be willing to lay down its weapons if a two-State solution was reached only months earlier, had been eliminated, and with him, perhaps the final hope at a peaceful solution.\n\nIn order to understand the thinking of the Israelis and to also comprehend what we are now seeing, we have to look at the situation through the cold lenses of strategy, robbing the situation of legal and moral interpretations.\n\nIsrael has failed to achieve its declared goal of its war in the Gaza Strip, vowing to completely destroy Hamas. If we take for instance the latest analysis published by CNN -- which combined the analyses of investigative journalists at the US media outlet with those of the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project and the Institute for the Study of War -- only 3 out of 24 Hamas battalions in Gaza have been rendered combat ineffective, while 13 were degraded and 8 are still combat effective. Despite the Israeli military's denial of these conclusions, the facts on the ground appear to strongly back the conclusions published by CNN, and although Benjamin Netanyahu declared to Congress last month that \"victory is in sight\", his own military admitted that they couldn't defeat Hamas.\n\nKeep in mind here, that the Israelis have, by their own admission, failed to destroy 80% of the Gaza tunnel systems that the resistance fighters use, despite attempting to flood them with water and fill them with chemical gas. On top of this, there are around a dozen Palestinian armed groups inside the Gaza Strip that are combating Israel's ground invasion and there is no sign that any of them have been completely defeated either as we still receive communiques and videos from them which feature their fighters launching attacks on Israeli military targets.\n\nIsrael is also lying about its military casualties in the Gaza Strip, as contradictory reports continually surface about how many injured soldiers there are, and the death toll is not consistent with what the video evidence suggests either.\n\nRegardless of how you see the above, however, Israel has failed to defeat Hamas after 10 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip and their use of maximum firepower, with little to no concern for civilian life. The Israelis are also suffering from a significant problem in troop motivation, as their soldiers are tired and many have expressed no desire to continue fighting, while they additionally suffer from a shortage of tanks and armored personnel carriers that they need to fight on other fronts. Israel has also failed to free its captives held in Gaza, killing more of them than it has managed to actually recapture. This, as an internal Israeli crisis continues to plague their society, with a battle between secular and religious threatening to spiral out of control.\n\nAll this as Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, understands well that ending the war will cost him his far-right coalition and perhaps lead to further chaos, in addition to his arrest on charges of corruption if he was to lose the election that would inevitably follow.\n\nIt suffices to say that Israel is at a breaking point, 46,000 businesses have closed since October 7, while projections predict that this figure will rise to 60,000 by the end of 2024. The Israeli Port of Eilat has declared bankruptcy, while hundreds of thousands of Israelis remain displaced or have moved away from the surrounding settlements around Gaza or the Lebanese border. The blow that Hamas delivered to Israel's security, military, intelligence, weapons industry, and political elitists on October 7, has never been recovered from, as Hezbollah and Yemen's Ansarallah strike at will against Israeli targets.\n\nThe US-Israeli vision prior to the Hamas-led October 7 attack was to formally establish ties between Riyadh and Tel Aviv, paving the way for the construction of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), which the Biden administration announced on September 9, 2023, during the G-20 summit hosted by India. US President Joe Biden announced the IMEC as a \"really big deal\", believing that all the chips were in place to initiate Saudi-Israeli normalization and begin creating the new trade route through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and then occupied Palestine.\n\nIn reality, Washington had completely ignored the plight of the Palestinians and assumed them to be a non-issue, proceeding to go ahead with the tunnel vision approach of pursuing a policy that was going to lead to catastrophe in West Asia. The plan was to form an \"Arab NATO\" that would be led by the Israelis, designed to combat Iran and to construct this new trade route that was designed to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative in line with the US' Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).\n\nHamas shattered the dreams and aspirations of the US-Israeli alliance on October 7, putting the Palestinian cause for Statehood back on the map. Israel's response, backed fully by their US allies, was designed to make the Palestinians pay the ultimate price for daring to disrupt their West Asia agenda. Yet the further Israel took the conflict, the worse its own predicament got and the less likely it began to appear that the Israelis were going to achieve their war goals.\n\nThe whole world looked on in shock and horror at the genocide that was taking place inside the Gaza Strip, while every single organ of the United Nations worked overtime to point out how egregious Israel's crimes were, the record of which does not need to be mentioned here as it is so incredibly lengthy and publcailly acknowledged. However, the US government stood by Israel's side and refused to say no. No sane American voices emerged from Washington to deter the US-Israeli alliance from escalating and therefore the Israelis were given a free hand to continue their vengeance policy in Gaza.\n\nIsrael was left with two options:\n\n1) Pursue an immediate ceasefire, which would end the war in Gaza and all the other fronts. A ceasefire which would have included a prisoner exchange to free captives on both sides and to then continue on to negotiate some kind of interim agreement that would pave the way to a meaningful two-State solution. Off the back of this there could have been the possibility of there still being a route to Saudi-Israeli normalization, and dialogue between Iran and the United States to revive the Iran Nuclear Deal, while the Israeli economy could slowly find its way to stability. From there, the Israeli domestic situation would begin to boil, yet there could have been methods of attempting to find middle-ground with strong influence from American Zionists and the US government.\n\n2) Refuse to accept compromise, expand the war to other fronts with the hope that you can contain the situation to limited wars and battles, without triggering a full-scale regional conflagration. This strategy, as I have written about for The Last American Vagabond in the past, would include escalation on the Lebanese front specifically, so that Israel can claim to have confronted Hezbollah and end the conflict it causes in a stale-mate. After closing this war, they would then move on to annexing territory in the occupied West Bank and hold this up as a victory from the war.\n\nIsrael chose the latter strategy, which now comes at a major cost. Not only have the Israelis -- with US backing -- decided to enter into a new phase of conflict with regional actors, they have killed any possibility for peace in the future.\n\nAt this point, the situation can go one of two ways. Either their will be an all-out regional war that will wipe Israel off the face of the earth, or the situation will manage to quiet down after significant death and destruction on both sides.\n\nIsrael took a great gamble by carrying out these two assassinations. According to Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah, the Secretary General of Hezbollah, Israel committed three separate actions which deserve responses; the Israelis assassinated a Hezbollah leader, attacked the Lebanese Capital, and committed a civilian massacre. While the assassination of Ismail Hanniyeh destroyed the prospect of reaching an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, while also violating Iran's sovereignty and dealing a massive blow to Iranian security. Iran therefore officially informed the UN of their intention to respond in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter.\n\nBoth the Israeli and American governments, who share equal guilt in this escalation that we are now seeing, are betting on being able to limit the scope of the war. If we are to assume that the Israeli-US alliance is not suicidal, because an all out war will wipe Israel off of the map, then we must interpret their actions as a desperate last ditch attempt to try and assert their dominance over the region.\n\nIf the Israelis can pull through a regional war, which does not transform into an all out battle to the death, then they can claim a small victory by simply surviving. Then, from there, they can bring in the United Nations to force an end to the war on all fronts, conclude a deal with Hamas in Gaza, before moving on to fixating on the West Bank. So, in their strategic thinking, they have pulled off a bold move, which could manage to salvage a stalemate and save them from a slow defeat. At the end of which they will hold up those they assassinated as trophies to their own people, before enacting a land grab.\n\nTo say the least, this is a risky and reckless strategy. It could also backfire, resulting in a situation in which Israel will collapse as a State. If the fall of Israel seems inevitable, they will have two options at this point also:\n\n1) Fire nuclear warheads (AKA the Samson Option)\n\n2) Allow for a multinational regional force to send its armies into Palestine/Israel in order to secure the territory. This could include the Egyptian, Jordanian, and Turkish armed forces, which would be used to hold territory and deter attacks from groups fighting Israel out of Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. This would be a strategy employed to save Israel from losing its territory, while also providing a way for Israeli citizens to flee the country.\n\nWe have entered a dangerous period of war and this could easily escalate into a situation that spins out of everyone's control. Unfortunately, the US government has allowed this to happen and may involve itself in such an un-winnable war.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"},

Other reports suggest a drone or missile strike.\n\nThis move not only highlights Netanyahu's aggressive stance but also reflects a calculated effort to deepen Israel's involvement in ongoing hostilities.\n\nThe killing of Haniyeh, who was based in Tehran and had no direct role in the recent Hamas attack on Oct. 7, has significant implications. He was engaged at the time in peace negotiations with mediators from Qatar and Egypt, and his death has effectively dismantled any prospect for dialogue aimed at securing the release of Israeli hostages or ending the ceaseless killing of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThis development was underscored by the fact that United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken publicly denied any prior knowledge or involvement in the attack, further eroding Washington's already fragile credibility. (Related: U.S. leading diplomatic efforts to prevent Israel from retaliating against Hezbollah strikes.)\n\nDespite this denial, U.S. security officials were briefing journalists within an hour of the attack, confirming the death of a senior member of the \"Axis of Resistance,\" an informal, Iranian-led political and military coalition made up of a variety of national governments and militant groups, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nNetanyahu's move aligns with his long-standing belief that Iran is the primary force behind regional resistance, with Hamas and Hezbollah acting as its proxies.\n\nThis perspective has been a central theme in Netanyahu's political strategy, which has consistently aimed to undermine Palestinian aspirations and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nNetanyahu's recent actions suggest that he views Haniyeh's assassination as a strategic step towards his ultimate goal of securing a decisive victory for Israel, even if it means dragging the U.S. and potentially other friendly nations into a broader regional conflict.\n\nIn addition to the broader strategic implications, Netanyahu's decision also has immediate consequences for ongoing negotiations.\n\nHis assassination is expected to strengthen Hamas rather than weaken it. Haniyeh, who had lost numerous family members, including sons and grandsons, to Israeli attacks, was respected for his ability to prioritize the Palestinian cause over personal grief. His death is likely to galvanize support for Hamas and enhance its stature in Palestinian and broader Arab and Muslim communities.\n\nThe broader context of this escalation includes significant internal challenges for Israel. Recent reports have highlighted severe mistreatment of detainees at the Sde Teiman detention center, where allegations of torture and abuse have emerged.\n\nThese revelations, coupled with protests and unrest, underscore growing domestic instability within Israel. The arrest of soldiers accused of sexual abuse and the subsequent protests at Sde Teiman, involving both reservists and far-right parliamentarians, reflect deep fractures within the Israeli military and society.\n\nNetanyahu's decision to escalate the conflict with the assassination of Haniyeh appears to be a strategic gamble, aimed at redirecting attention from internal issues and consolidating political support.\n\nHowever, it risks exacerbating existing tensions and destabilizing Israel further. The Israeli military's understanding of the situation indicates that killing Haniyeh may have been counterproductive, given the current inability to achieve a decisive military victory or address the complex geopolitical dynamics involving Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other resistance groups.\n\nWatch this broadcast from PressTV discussing how Ismail Haniyeh's assassination could not have been done

Today's Palestinian authority has lost its appeal and influence as it once had under the charismatic leadership of Yasser Arafat.\n\nHamas has filled the gap left by the unpopular and corrupt leadership of Mahmoud Abbas. By killing Hamas' top leader, Israel has unilaterally changed the rules of Arab and Gulf security.\n\nThe new Palestinian response to the Gaza crisis may not be totally in control of the Gulf states as the Americans and Israelis would have desired.\n\nEgypt heavily relied on Hamas to maintain the fragile security between Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt felt betrayed and isolated by the Americans and Israelis. The assassination is a serious setback for Egypt as well.\n\nInterestingly, Turkey and Egypt have spoken more frequently these days about the Gaza crisis and about helping each other. The Turkish foreign minister is in Cairo and has also visited the Rafah border to inspect the distribution of Turkish assistance.\n\nWhen Egyptian President Abdelfattah Al Sisi visits Ankara next month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan may offer him bigger opportunities to revive Egypt's historical role in the Arab world.\n\nIsrael and its Western backers must be concerned about how the regional powers realign their interests and strategies for new regional security with Palestine at the centre.\n\nOmair Anas is Assistant Professor of International Relations at Ankara Yildirim

Additionally, the Islamic State has condemned Hamas for its cooperation with Shia factions, particularly Iran and Hezbollah. Therefore, as expected, the Central Asian branches of the two global Sunni terror organizations exploited the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh for their own mercenary purposes, just as they had previously leveraged the issue of liberating the Muslim holy sites of Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) and Masjid al-Aqsa from Israeli occupation to bolster their ideological foundations and intensify their recruitment efforts.\n\nThe Islamic State's Aggressive Approach to Haniyeh's Assassination\n\nOn August 2, following the assassination of Haniyeh, the Islamic State's al-Naba weekly newsletter, in its 454th issue, published an editorial entitled with a Quranic verse \"Those who perished through disbelief would perish upon evidence.\" The article derided the Hamas leader as a \"sellout\" tyrant who, instead of being a martyr for Jerusalem, became a \"martyr of Tehran,\" having died in the arms of rafidas (rejectionists - a derogatory term for Shiites) on their stronghold.\n\nThe official Islamic State propaganda outlet compared Haniyeh to Qassem Soleimani, the slain senior IRGC commander, stating that both met the same \"disgraceful end\" as \"enemies of Allah, His Prophet, and all Sunni believers.\" The editorial accused Haniyeh of fighting under the banner of Iran's \"Axis of Resistance\" and taking orders from its coordination centers in Lebanon and Tehran.\n\nAs expected, al-Naba's editorial served as an ideological blueprint for the Central Asian Uzbek, Tajik, and Russian-speaking ISKP propaganda media, who exploited its themes to capitalize on historical Muslim-Jewish enmity and present the Islamic State as the sole liberator of the holy land.\n\nThe pro-ISKP Russian-language Telegram channel \"Baqo\" mocked the slain Haniyeh, labeling him a murtad (apostate). According to the channel, Hamas' democratic governance system in Gaza allowed them to enact laws contrary to those of Allah. It argued that Allah punished Haniyeh with a dishonorable death, unworthy of a shahid (martyr), as he allied with the rafidas of Iran and the mushriks (polytheist) of Hezbollah.\n\nAnother ISKP supporter, Abu Turob, stated on his Uzbek-language Telegram channel that \"Hamas and its leader Haniyeh did not come to power through holy jihad, but rather through democratic elections in Palestine, governing based on man-made laws that contradict the Sharia laws of the Almighty. Therefore, Ismail Haniyeh is not worthy of being honored as a shahid, and Allah will determine his place in Hell,\" he concluded.\n\nAdditionally, the Uzbek-language pro-ISKP Telegram channels \"Salomatqolb,\" \"Muvahhidlar Muhokamasi,\" and \"Xuroson Ovozi Nashri\" denounced Hamas and its slain leader Haniyeh as apostates and political slaves of Shiite Iran.\n\nNotably, the consistency of the propaganda publications and the unified negative reaction toward Hamas' activities demonstrated the effective coordination between Islamic State Central's official media and ISKP's local jihadi outlets, both in terms of Islamic ideological content and hierarchical communication.\n\nAl-Qaida Adapting Haniyeh's Assassination to Amplify Anti-U.S. Sentiment\n\nAl-Qaida, its Central-Asian affiliates, and pro-Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and pro-Taliban Uzbek and Tajik jihadi groups have taken a different stance than Islamic State-affiliated groups regarding the assassination of Haniyeh and the current state of the Israeli-Hamas war.\n\nOn July 31, 2024, al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) released a statement in Arabic, English, Urdu, and Pashto eulogizing Haniyeh and threatening Israel and the United States with retaliation for his murder. This marked the first such statement from an al-Qaida branch, aimed at its diverse audience of followers.\n\nIn contrast to the Islamic State, al-Qaida honored Haniyeh as a \"prominent leader of the Mujahideen of Islam,\" expressing \"profound sorrow and grief\" at his death. The AQIS statement expressed condolences \"to the entire Muslim Ummah, to all the Mujahideen worldwide, and to the leadership, members, and Mujahid companions of Hamas and al-Qassam Brigades,\" asserting that Haniyeh became a shahid at \"the hands of the Jews, the eternal enemies of Allah, His Messenger, and the Muslims.\"\n\nThe group elevated Haniyeh's martyrdom to the stature of \"prominent leaders of al-Qaida and the global jihadi movement, such as Osama bin Laden and Abdullah Azzam, alongside Hamas leaders like Ahmad Yassin,\" signaling warming relations between al-Qaida and Hamas. AQIS asserted that the war in Gaza \"is not merely a local conflict but a global war between Islam and kufr [non-belief]\" The group called on its supporters to \"target America and Israel, which are two faces of the same coin, waging a global war against Islam.\"\n\nIn conclusion, al-Qaida assured that in the wake of Haniyeh's assassination, the divine victory from Allah is imminent, heralding the liberation of Masjid al-Aqsa, the annihilation of the Jews, and the ultimate triumph of the Muslim Ummah against the global Zionist world.\n\nNotably, al-Qaida and Hamas have a complex and contentious history. When Hamas won the Palestinian Legislative Council elections in 2006, al-Qaida criticized them for participating in \"polytheistic councils.\" Al-Qaida also accused Hamas of \"losing its religion\" due to its involvement in international diplomacy.\n\nFollowing al-Qaida's recent statement, several aligned Central Asian Salafi-Jihadi groups in Afghanistan and Syria echoed the same propaganda framework in their responses to the assassination of Haniyeh. For instance, the Katibat al-Ghuraba al-Turkistan jihadi group, which comprises Uyghur, Uzbek, and local Arab militants and has extensively covered the events surrounding the Israel-Hamas war, referred to Haniyeh as a brave defender of Islam.\n\nAbu Saloh, the former leader of the Katibat al-Tawhid wal Jihad group and one of the most noteworthy ideological standard-bearers of the Central Asian Salafi Jihadist movement, published two posts on his Telegram channel \"Fikrlar.\" In his first post, he accused Iran of providing Israel with information about Haniyeh's whereabouts and eulogized him, along with his deceased children and grandchildren, as true shahids. In his second post, Abu Saloh observed that Hamas had previously lost more prominent and influential leaders than Haniyeh, yet this did not affect its combat effectiveness or its resolve to wage holy jihad against the Jewish invaders in Palestine. This resilience, according to him, indicates that Hamas has a robust system for training mujahideen leaders.\n\nOne of the widely-followed pro-Katibat al-Tawhid wal Jihad Telegram channels, \"Ovozli Yangiliklar,\" praised the martyrdom of Haniyeh, citing it as inspiration to continue holy jihad against the enemies of Islam. Furthermore, Uzbek, Russian, and Tajik-language Telegram channels that promote the jihadi ideology of al-Qaida, the Taliban, and HTS - such as \"Guroba Media,\" \"Global Tahlil,\" \"Maxfiy Haqiat,\" \"Faruk Shami,\" \"Abu Valid,\" and \"Abdullah Azat\" - sought to capitalize on the death of the Hamas leader. They accused Iran, the U.S., and Israel of committing genocide against Muslims in Gaza, thereby spreading anti-Jewish, anti-Shia, and anti-Western sentiments.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it is crucial to recognize that Ismail Haniyeh's assassination has markedly influenced the radicalization of global Sunni jihadist organizations, including al-Qaida and the Islamic State, as well as their Central Asian regional affiliates. Despite their intense competition for global jihadi leadership and ideological differences with Hamas, both al-Qaida and the Islamic State have adeptly leveraged the October 7 attack, the ensuing conflict, and Haniyeh's assassination to incite their followers to commit further attacks.\n\nAlthough these groups, along with Central Asian jihadists, cannot directly affect the conflict in Gaza, the ongoing turmoil may exacerbate lone-wolf terrorist activities by radicalized Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek Salafi migrants in both Russia and the West, potentially mirroring incidents such as the Crocus City Hall attack.\n\nIt is essential to remember that recent post-Soviet terrorist attacks carried out by Tajik, Ingush, Chechen, and Dagestani Salafi lone-wolf operatives in France, Iran, Turkey, Moscow, and Dagestan as well as the foiled terror plots in Germany and France, were ideologically connected to the religious undertones of the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza differs significantly from those in Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan, where Central Asians traveled to directly participate, collaborate with local insurgents, and thereby influence the conflicts from within. As demonstrated by the reactions of pro-Islamic State and pro-al-Qaida Central Asian Salafi-Jihadi groups to Ismail Haniyeh's assassination, although unable to participate directly in the Israel-Hamas war, both factions are endeavoring to propagate their narratives to incite supporters against the Shia rafida axis and the U.S.-Israel \"Crusader-Zionist\" alliance.\n\nThe longer the Israel-Hamas war continues, the greater the threat of lone-wolf attacks among Central Asian Salafi migrants will become. Therefore, EU and U.S. intelligence agencies should delve deeper into the Salafi migrant environment and meticulously analyze their radicalization process, as their involvement in the Palestinian issue is felt more acutely in the West than in Central Asia.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

[Aseel Mafarjeh/TNA]\n\nWhile the region boils with the anticipated escalations on the back of Ismail Haniyeh's assassination, with Iran gearing to respond by striking Israeli targets and Western countries warning citizens from remaining in Lebanon, the politician's murder, who also headed the Palestinian negotiating team for the ceasefire deal, is hoped to bring a much-awaited reconciliation among Palestine's disputing factions.\n\nFollowing Haniyeh's assassination in Tehran by Israel, protests were held all across the occupied territories, from Ramallah, to Hebron, Jerusalem and elsewhere. During these rallies, organisers forbade the raising of any flags but Palestine's, and participants called him \"the man of unity\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Authority, governed by Fatah which had a years-long feud with Haniyeh's Hamas, declared days of mourning. In a rare gesture, President Mahmoud Abbas called Khaled Meshaal, tipped to be the next Hamas leader, for the first time since 2020 to express condolences. Abbas also urged Palestinians to unite against the \"terrorism\" which led to Haniyeh's murder.\n\nAccording to Palestinian journalist Nael Buaital, the implications of Haniyeh's assassination testify to the man's importance. \"The West Bank witnessed assassinations of several leaders from various Palestinian factions over time. Residents of the West Bank are used to this. However, these assassinations never triggered any major fears among people of the West Bank the way Haniyeh's assassination did,\" he noted.\n\nWhile Gaza has been governed by Hamas since 2007, and many of its residents exhausted by war hold its leaders, including Haniyeh, as key factors behind the grim, war-wrecked state they live in, many in the occupied West Bank long for Hamas' proactive politicians.\n\nMariam, who asked to be identified by her surname only in fear of being persecuted by Israel for mourning Hanieyeh's death, said the news of his assassination remains one she cannot fathom.\n\n\"I read it once, twice, three times, unable to believe it. I thought: 'But he wasn't even in Gaza!' It feels like I've lost someone so close to me. He was our best shot of reaching a ceasefire. He was heard. Hamas is heard. They've made the whole world stop and listen,\" she said.\n\nThe Ramallah-based resident also opined that killing Haniyeh is not a blow to Hamas alone, but to all Palestinians. \"He spoke of us, about us. His words united us. He, too, lost his sons. He, too, was displaced. He was one of us,\" she concluded.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments, Buaital pointed to Haniyeh's legacy as the prime minister of the short-lived national unity government which governed Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem in 2006, until Western pressures and sour relations between Hamas and Fatah led to its dismantling in 2007, and Hamas imposing its authority over Gaza since.\n\n\"It was brief, but marked an important period for us as Palestinians,\" he recalled.\n\nThis longing for unity, he said, is what makes many in the occupied West Bank hope that the assassination would usher in a new era in which factions put aside differences for the best interest of Palestinians.\n\nJamil Abu Sada, a retired professor at Birzeit University, echoed the same thoughts. \"Haniyeh's assassination is feared to lead to more assassinations as Israel seeks to buy time and keep the war ongoing. It's therefore hoped that politicians realise this, and put their hands together to keep Haniyeh's legacy ongoing as a man for unity and peaceful resistance,\" he noted.\n\nBut not everyone in the occupied West Bank agrees. As protests were underway with Palestinians denouncing Haniyeh's murder, many were walking past, oblivious to the crowds and their chants.\n\nOne man, who asked not to be named, said Haniyeh \"is a politician like the rest of them. I don't see why he's being glorified. What has he done to us as Palestinians? He's been abroad since 2017. What have we gained from that?\"\n\nAnother man, clearly touched by Haniyeh's death, refused to comment, saying, \"I don't want to get into trouble from the PA or the Israelis. They both can't stand anyone expressing appreciation to Hamas and Haniyeh.\"\n\nAccording to Mohamed Shahin, dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies at Al-Quds Open University, Haniyeh's assassination is a reminder that \"Palestinians' fate should not be pegged to one individual or one person. There must be a unity and a commitment to which all parties sign up in order to end the status quo,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about time factions work out a way to work together and end this stalemate that is costing us so many lives,\" he added.\n\nHe further noted that the assassination is bound to extend the duration of Israel's war on Gaza, which he said Haniyeh's latest negotiation efforts focused on negotiating an end to. \"The timing of his murder is yet another proof that Israel has no intention of ending this war. Haniyeh was one politician who worked hard towards a ceasefire. Eliminating him is akin to eliminating the prospects of a ceasefire,\" he said by phone.\n\nAbu Sada, of Birzeit University, agrees, stating that Haniyeh's political and military power had made him \"a world-class negotiator whose authority and edge made him feared by occupation forces. Taking him out is a massive hurdle for Palestinians' efforts to end the war.\"\n\nAgreeing with the blow Haniyeh's assassination has on the ceasefire talks, assistant undersecretary at the Ministry of Labour Abdulkareem Daragama said the only way this could be in the interest of Palestinians, is if it brings domestic peace.\n\n\"There is no doubt Israel wants to kill more, and it will do anything to do that,\" he noted. \"The only way Haniyeh's death could be turned against them is if the reconciliation of factions' leaderships and the unification of the national goal materialises, even if the difference in visions or even political opinion persist. Haniyeh's assassination could bring together the unity he sought,\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ramallah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaled_Mashal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khaled Mashal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian National Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hebron"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birzeit_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birzeit University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

However, Sinwar -- considered by Israel as the mastermind of the October 7, 2023 killing spree -- is believed to be living in the network of tunnels of the Hamas near either Rafah or Khan Younis region of southern Gaza.\n\nThe spokesperson of Israel Defence Forces (IDF), Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, in a press statement on Tuesday night after Hamas announced Sinwar as its political head, said: \"Yahya Sinwar is a terrorist, who is responsible for the most brutal terrorist attack in history -- October 7. There is only one place for Yahya Sinwar, and it is beside Mohammed Deif and the rest of the October 7 terrorists. That is the only place we're preparing and intending for him.\"\n\nThe Defence Minister of Israel Yoav Gallant had also publicly said that Israel would hunt down Yahya Sinwar and kill him.\n\nSinwar joined Hamas in 1987 when it was founded by Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, and had served 27 years in Israeli prisons over four jail terms. He is well-versed in Hebrew and has always been considered the most ruthless of Hamas leaders.\n\nWith Yahya Sinwar becoming the most powerful leader of Hamas, it has to be seen how the indirect peace talks being carried out at the behest of the United States, Qatar and Egypt would move forward.\n\nAccording to Israel, of the 251 hostages captured by Hamas on October 7, 2023, after the massacre and mayhem, 111 are still under the custody of Hamas. This includes 39 dead and Yahya Sinwar is believed to be hiding in the tunnels surrounded by these hostages.\n\nHezbollah drone attack on Israel\n\nLebanon's armed group Hezbollah announced that it launched drones on military targets in northern Israel on Tuesday.\n\nHezbollah said in a statement that it launched an air attack \"with a squadron of suicide drones that targeted the headquarters of the Golani Brigade and the headquarters of the Egoz Unit 621 in the Shraga barracks north of occupied Acre\".\n\nConfrontations between Hezbollah and the Israeli army escalated following Israel's attack on Dahieh in Beirut's southern suburbs, killing Hezbollah senior military commander Fouad Shokor and seven civilians, Xinhua news agency reported.\n\nHezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah threatened a \"definite and painful\" response to the Israeli raid at the appropriate time and place.\n\nTensions along the Lebanon-Israel border escalated on October 8, 2023, following a barrage of rockets launched by Hezbollah toward Israel in solidarity with Hamas' attack on Israel the day before.\n\nIsrael then retaliated by firing heavy artillery toward southeastern Lebanon.\n\nA suicide drone also known as a loitering munition, or exploding drone, is a kind of aerial weapon with a built-in warhead that is typically designed to loiter around a target area until a target is located, then attack the target by crashing into it.\n\nEgypt, Jordan leaders hold talks\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi spoke by phone with His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan.\n\nThe two leaders discussed the regional situation, especially in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThey reviewed the intensive contacts by the two countries to contain the tense situation in the Middle East.\n\nThe two leaders stressed the priority of achieving calm at the current stage, especially reaching an immediate and sustainable ceasefire in the Strip, to de-escalate the tension and end the humanitarian catastrophe that the people of Gaza are facing.\n\nThey stressed that the main guarantor for restoring stability in the region is to find a political horizon to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, based on the two-state solution, which guarantees the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nQatar, Jordan review situation\n\nQatar and Jordan emphasised that stopping the war on the Gaza Strip represents the first step to defusing tension and escalation in the region.\n\nThis came when Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani received a phone call on Tuesday from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Dr. Ayman Al Safadi.\n\nAccording to Qatar News Agency (QNA), the ministers discussed cooperation relations between the two countries and ways to support and develop them, the developments in Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories, the repercussions of the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital Tehran, and ways to calm down and de-escalate the situation in the region.\n\nThey also stressed the continuation of coordination, consultation, and joint work between the two countries to stop the war and put an end to the humanitarian disaster witnessed by the Gaza Strip.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

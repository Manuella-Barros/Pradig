{"id": 225027858, "title": "Civil rights complaint filed against Baltimore over trash incinerator", "text": "Community groups filed a federal civil rights complaint Tuesday against Baltimore City\u2019s Department of Public Works, arguing that it has failed to create an effective plan to wean itself off of the air-polluting trash incinerator. The complaint was filed under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which holds that entities receiving government support cannot discriminate against individuals because of their race, color, national origin or sex. The complaint focuses on the city\u2019s Ten-Year Solid Waste Management Plan, which was approved by Mayor Brandon Scott in November, and by the Maryland Department of the Environment in January. It argues that the city failed to chart a clear path for diverting waste from the WIN Waste incinerator in South Baltimore, which burns trash from around the region, releasing pollutants such as greenhouse gases, particulate matter, mercury and lead. By failing to do so, the city is discriminating against the predominantly Black and Hispanic communities near the incinerator, including Cherry Hill, Mt. Winans, Brooklyn, Lakeland, Westport and Curtis Bay, according to the complaint. Many of those South Baltimore communities already are beset by industrial pollution, argues the complaint, with a combined 279 facilities in those neighborhoods. The complaint was filed by the nonprofit South Baltimore Community Land Trust, which is represented by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Environmental Integrity Project.

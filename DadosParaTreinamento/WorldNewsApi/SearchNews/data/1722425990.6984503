{"id": 243256196, "title": "Travis Kelce praised for balancing fame and football amid Taylor Swift romance", "text": "Ex-NFL ace Greg Olsen has praised Travis Kelce for maintaining his focus amidst soaring fame, particularly after hooking up with megastar Taylor Swift. Since going public with Swift last year, Kansas City Chiefs' leading man and four-time All-Pro Kelce has seen his star status skyrocket, culminating in a surprise appearance on stage with Swift at London's Wembley Stadium. Kelce was also spotted at the fourth annual Tight End University in Nashville, Tennessee, just days prior, a project he co-created with former Carolina Panthers star Olsen and San Francisco 49ers' George Kittle. The event saw over 70 budding athletes gather at Vanderbilt University for training, topped off with a bash and tunes from country sensation Jelly Roll. Olsen is convinced that despite the dizzying heights of fame, both Kelce, aged 34, and Kittle, aged 30, remain exemplary figures for the next generation of football talent. \"All these other things off the field and around the game continued to expand for them,\" Olsen confided to PEOPLE magazine. \"And I think a lot of guys struggle with that. \"I think the two of them understand their priorities and keeping things in that order, and I think for those two guys, the key is for them to have this success year in and year out is just a testament to their approach of how they do things. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. \"At the core of what they are, they're football players. All that extra stuff and all the intention, it comes and goes, and I'm sure parts of it are amazing and have great perks, and I'm sure part of it's hard. Obviously I don't live in those shoes, but when it's time to work, no one was more engaged in the work in the classroom and the work on the field than both George and Travis.\" In addition to providing coaching and mentoring to young tight ends and quarterbacks, the event raised more than $800,000 for youth charities in Nashville. Olsen, who has been bumped down to FOX's No.2 NFL commentary crew for next season after the arrival of Tom Brady, said Kelce's selflessness stands out despite his stardom. \"Travis is super gracious with his time and everything, and I think it's great,\" he said. \"There's a whole new fan base. I mean, I have an 11-year-old daughter, so I get it firsthand. I think it's great for everyone. I think it's great for the game and the league and yeah, I think there was a lot of fans excited to see the guys.\"", "summary": "Travis Kelce has seen his profile rise since he began dating music superstar Taylor Swift - and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end made his on-stage debut with the pop icon on Saturday", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-nfl-33131834", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/article33131833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_gettyimages-2157706524.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:11:36", "author": "Sam Frost", "authors": ["Sam Frost"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.748}

{"id": 231230002, "title": "Thousands rush for tickets after Taylor Swift's 'unmissable' UK Eras debut is dubbed 'best night ever' by fans", "text": "Thousands of fans have rushed to snag last-minute tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, after rave reviews of the first show proclaimed it 'the best night ever.' Up to 30,000 fans per hour have swarmed online ticket marketplace Viagogo today in a bid to find tickets for the remaining 14 UK dates, with the excited rush coming after a positive reception for the much-anticipated show. Swifties - the name for the singer's diehard fans, some of whom are so devoted they said they would wear nappies for the show to avoid missing a moment - braced 7-degree chill and drizzling weather to queue at Murrayfield from 5am to snag the best spots for the iconic concert. The crowd, who were wrapped in large coats over their sparkling outfits, also had to evade a large flock of seagulls attracted by the litter. But according to online reaction the effort was definitely worth it. Fans and critics alike hailed Swift's performance in Edinburgh as 'phenomenal,' with Daily Record music critic John Dingwall referring to it as 'a spectacle not to be missed,' reports MyLondon.

The Eras Tour has been revamped for its European leg and featuring music from Swift's new chart-topping album The Tortured Poets Department. Elsewhere, Swift herself lauded UK fans for their enthusiasm, stating they were 'beautifully generous' and had welcomed her and her crew with open arms. She added: \"Even before we got here, you showed love and passion. I can't stop looking at the crowd, I'm fully distracted by how great you are.\" The concert thrilled the 70,000-strong crowd but there were unexpected moments of drama, with the starlet tweaking the lyrics in Would've, Could've, Should've to signal that a fan in the crowd was in trouble, saying she wouldn't continue until security and event organisers intervened to help. A mishap during an acoustic set also prompted Swift to momentarily halt the performance in a move she branded as 'humiliating', when her hand suddenly stiffened making her unable to continue playing. While some fans opted for picnic blankets to listen from outside the venue last night, the praise from both fans and critics - with UK newspapers and magazines unanimously awarding the show five stars, and numerous fans on X, Tiktok and Facebook hailing it as 'the best night ever' - has led to a surge in demand for tickets for the remaining 14 sold-out shows. This morning saw up to 30,000 fans an hour turn to online resale sites hoping to secure last-minute tickets for the remaining gigs, which include two more nights in Edinburgh, before the star moves on to Liverpool, Cardiff and finally London. Sites such as Viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure things go smoothly as tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand meaning fans are buying at their own risk. Even with this warning, fans are looking to take the plunge. While Swift is not playing in Manchester during this tour, much to the disappointment of fans, she is performing three dates in Liverpool next week. For fans keen to get to see the show at Anfield, there are currently just around 1,000 seats available across the three nights, with best availability on Thursday, June 13. The cheapest Liverpool tickets available now on Viagogo are \u00a3265 for seated and \u00a3407 for standing. The most expensive individual seat is \u00a31,180. Meanwhile London is playing host to more than a week of shows by the star. For fans keen to see the show at Wembley Stadium, there are currently a few hundred tickets available for each of the eight nights, with cheapest tickets available now on Viagogo \u00a3317 for seated and \u00a3464 for standing, both on Sunday, June 23. The most expensive individual ticket is a whopping \u00a32,236. Limited tickets are still available for all UK dates on the tour not just through Viagogo but also Vivid Tickets and, in considerably fewer numbers, Ticketmaster although prices across all sites vary by night and availability", "summary": "Up to 30,000 fans an hour are currently trying to snag tickets for the Cruel Summer star's show after the barnstorming first night", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/thousands-rush-tickets-after-taylor-29317421", "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29317398.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Taylor-Swifts-Eras-Tour-Edinburgh.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:59:15", "author": "Narin Flanders", "authors": ["Narin Flanders"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.306}

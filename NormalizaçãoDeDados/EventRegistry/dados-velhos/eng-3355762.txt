Sachin continued his form with help of his pace and movement to add to the woes of the Mumbai outfit.\n\nThe home side continued to heap all round dominance on the Mumbai outfit to all-out them twice in the first half helping them take a huge 20-6 lead at half-time.\n\nThe second half was nothing different from the first with the home side continuing to build on their lead with the opposition failing to help themselves out of trouble.\n\nFor the Mumbai outfit, captain Kumar opened the points tally after couple of empty raids but the team failed to combine in unison to heap damage on the opposition.\n\nIn the second half substitute Adake along with Nitin Madane, Kuldeep accumulated few points through their successful raids.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "timeCrawl": "17:21:00", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8669694", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Technology", "id": 349, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "id": 413, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "id": 565, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "id": 785, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "id": 933, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As the league moved to Ahmedabad, a well rejuvenated Gujarat Fortunegiants smashed U Mumba 39-21 to begin their home leg on a high note.\n\nUnlike their previous games, Gujarat was not dependent on one player. They clicked as a whole unit, something that the home crowd was expecting from them. Fortunegiants had three accomplished raiders - Rohit Guia, Sachin and captain Sukesh Hegde. With Sukesh looking after the team, young guns Sachin and Rohit spearheaded through U Mumba's defence.\n\nWhile Sachin ran riot in the first half, Rohit took charge in the next. Both accumulated 17 points together. Anup, who is leading the Mumbai-based franchise for the fifth time, felt wretched after the defeat as he had no words to define his team's substandard efforts. \"Jo plan kia tha uska 10% bhi deliver nhi kia. (We didn't deliver what we had planned for),\" Anup said in the post-match conference. \"Bhagwan toh hoon nhi. Kabhi saari raids mein points aajte hai, aur kabhi luck bilkul nhi chalta.\" When asked about him not able to score points, Anup Kumar seemed visibly upset and refused to comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Fortunegiants inflicted four all outs in the entire game whereas U Mumba could not even come close. Only in the sixth minute, Sachin in his third raid gave the home team an eight point lead and with three minutes remaining, Gujarat imposed the second all-out of the game as they went into the half time with the 20-6 lead.\n\nWith the raiders in sublime form, the Iranian duo of Fazel Atrachali and Abozar manned Gujarat's defence stoically. U Mumba's Shabeer Bapu, Nitin Madane and the 'captain cool' himself looked powerless. Shabeer was not able to even open his account while Anup and Nitin managed to score four and three points in over 12 raids.\n\nAfter the match, Gujarat Fortunegiants coach, Manpreet heaped praises on the two youngsters and said, \"I was sure of these two from the beginning of the league. I believe that these two will leave a huge impact in this season. With the proper guidance from Sukesh and Fazel, I'm sure that these two boys will do something big,\" Manpreet said during the presser. \"Bas bhagwan ki mehar rhe uri team pe to ye team bhwat aage jaa sakti hai,\" delighted coach added.\n\n\"I'm supporting U Mumba from the very first season but only because of Anup Kumar. If he would have been in some other team this season, I would have supported that team,\" said a disheartened fan who wanted to meet his idol once.\n\nBeing the first of the four new teams to play at home, Gujarat will next be tested against Dabang Delhi and will hope to replicate today's performance against Meraj Sheykh & co.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Pro Kabaddi League 2017", "timeCrawl": "19:57:00", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 38, "amb": false, "textEnd": 53}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8692290", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "id": 282, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "id": 381, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "id": 435, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He looked to be the go to man for the debut side, helping them keep the scoreboard ticking though his incredible pace and leg movement inside the opposition mat, earning successful points from his raids.\n\nAfter lagging in the start, the city outfit returned on level terms courtesy of their star raider Sachin and captain Sukesh Hedge who combined to earn crucial points. With seven minutes on the clock, the home side took the initial 9-6 advantage.\n\nAt half-time, both the sides shared the honours, scoring 10 points each. Gujarat (seven points) earned most of their score through raids while Delhi (five points) earned the most of their score from tackles.\n\nFor Gujarat, youngsters Sachin and Rohit Gulia along with Hedge, Fazel Atrachali and Abozar Mighani combined to help their side within the reach of the opponents score in the second half.\n\nLater both the youngsters for Gujarat pulled out some incredible show on the opponents half to all-out them taking a slender 28-25 lead with less than three minutes to play.\n\nFor Delhi, Sheykh opened the scoring in the second half clinching four points of his successful raid to give his side a 18-13 advantage also resulting into all-out of the opposition for the first time in the match.\n\nThe Iranian, who returned from the bench after several minutes, helped his side stay level with the opposition with 24 points each in less than five minutes but failed to ensure they register a win.", "timeCrawl": "19:21:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8834101", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Technology", "id": 349, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "id": 413, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "id": 565, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "id": 785, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

At half time, the score was 10-10. (Source: PKL Media) Gujarat Fortune Giants beat Dabang Delhi 29 - 25: Match highlightsPro Kabaddi 2017: Rohit Gulia, Sachin Tawar guide Gujarat Fortunegiants to mighty win over U MumbaPro Kabaddi season 5, Telugu Titans vs UP Yoddha live streaming: When and where to watch the match, live TV coverage, time in IST\n\nSachin Tawar continues to amaze everyone on and off the mat with his all-round abilities. Riding on the 18-year old raider, Gujarat Fortune Giants edged out Dabang Delhi 29-25 to register their second consecutive home win.\n\nThe two teams were on equal footing for a better part of the first half. Sachin and Meraj Shayk were leading the charge from their respective sides. At half time, the score was 10-10. Speaking to media during the post-match presser, Fortune Giants Manpreet Singh said that hearing \"Sachin..Sachin\" chant from the crowd gives him similar vibes of the chants that were heard for cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar.\" Sachin's game is improving day by day. If he continues to play like this, he will go on to become the Most Valuable Player of this season,\" Singh said. Sukesh Hegde, who is delighted by Sachin's performance, joined his coach too and added, \"With Sachin in such fine form, it is not letting the pressure build on us. We are playing freely and the crowd support has been phenomenal.\"\n\nIn just five games, Sachin featured in top five raiders of the season. Tawar is already ahead of Ajay Kumar, Nitin Tomar and Anup Kumar. Making a mark, Sachin is leading Gujarat's attacking department and has received support from captain Sukesh and Rohit Gulia. When asked Rohit about his game, the player didn't hesitate and replied quickly crediting the coach and the captain. \"Manpreet sir, Sukesh bhai have been motivating me. I only do what they ask me to do. Helping my team win is my only target.\"\n\nAfter Sachin and Rohit ran riot against U Mumba, Delhi came in with a certain plan for the two youngsters. To a certain extent, they did manage to restrict Sachin from scoring. He was taken down five times but that didn't stop the Fortunegiants' raider. Each Gujarat player scored a point except Parvesh Bhainswal as the home team continues to deliver what the home crowd is expecting from them.\n\nMeraj Sheykh and Ravi Dalal were their only standout performers for Dabang Delhi as others failed miserably. Iranian captain scored eight points while Ravi made three successful raids and scored two tackle points.\n\nFortunegiants next play Jaipur Pink Panthers and coach Manpreet said that they hope to continue their unbeaten run at home. \"Bas bhagwan ki kripa rhe to hum saare matches jeetenge Ahmedabad mein (With God's grace we shall continue our unbeaten run at home),\" Manpreet said. Gujarat have strengthened their hold in Zone A as they top the points table with 18 points from five games.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Pro Kabaddi League 2017", "timeCrawl": "20:33:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 38, "amb": false, "textEnd": 53}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8841070", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "id": 50, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "id": 282, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "id": 866, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Pal is serving a life sentence for the killing of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons. Staines had worked with leprosy patients in Orissa for 30 years.\n\nPal was represented by advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain in the apex court. Jain argued before a bench comprising justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti that his client has already spent more than 24 years in jail. Jain also cited the apex court's verdict ordering the premature release of convicts, who were serving life sentences, in the Rajiv Gandhi assignation case. After hearing Jain's submissions, the apex court issued notice to the Odisha government. The court scheduled the matter for further hearing after six weeks.\n\nPal's petition said that in AG Perarivalan vs State of TN (Rajiv Gandhi assassination case), the apex court directed the release of a convict sentenced to life imprisonment and whose conviction as well as death sentence were confirmed by it, however, later death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nThe plea said the petitioner is about 61 years of age and he has already undergone more than the qualified period, which is 14 years of sentence as stipulated in policy of the state government dated April 19, 2022. \"The petitioner has served more than 24 years of actual imprisonment (without remission).

He sought a direction to the state government to consider his case for premature release in accordance with the guidelines for premature release of life convicts issued in 2022 in the three cases in which he was convicted. ''The petitioner herein who happens to be about 61 years of age has already undergone more than the qualified period i.e. 14 years of sentence as stipulated in policy dated April 19, 2022 whereas the petitioner has served more than 24 years of actual imprisonment (without remission). ''It is noteworthy that the petitioner has never been released on parole and even when his mother passed away, he could not perform her last rites as he was not allowed to be released on parole,'' he submitted. Singh said the appropriate authorities are under legal obligation to consider his case for premature release under the 'Guideline for Premature Release 2022' passed by the Odisha government. He claimed they have failed to act in accordance with the related rules due to which his right to liberty, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, was jeopardised. ''The petitioner acknowledges and deeply regrets the transgressions perpetrated more than two decades ago. In the fervour of youth, fueled by impassioned reactions to the brutal history of India, the petitioner's psyche momentarily lost restraint. ''It is imperative for the court to scrutinise not merely the actions but the underlying intent, noting that there was no personal animosity harboured towards any victim,'' he said. Singh said he believes in the Karmic philosophy, and in order to cure the effects of bad Karma that he has gained through his actions, is praying before this court for an opportunity towards reformation of his character.\n\nA mob led by Singh attacked Staines and his two sons - 11-year-old Philip and 8-year-old Timothy - while they slept in their station wagon and then set the vehicle on fire in Manoharpur village of Keonjhar district on the intervening night of January 22-23, 1999. Dara Singh, the main accused in the triple murder, was convicted and sentenced to death by a CBI court in 2003. The Orissa High Court commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment in 2005 and it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2011.\n\nMehendra Hembram, an accomplice of Dara Singh, is also serving life imprisonment in the case, while 11 other accused were acquitted by the high court due to lack of evidence. Staines and his wife Gladys worked with Mayurbhanj Evangelical Missionary organisation and cared for leprosy patients.\n\nGladys Staines, who was awarded the Padmashree in 2005, had said she had forgiven the killers of her husband and sons and that she holds no bitterness against them. In his petition, Singh referred to the 2022 decision in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination case in which convict AG Perarivalan, serving life sentence, was ordered to be released by the apex court. Referring to the theory of reformative justice propounded by noted jurist and former apex court judge VR Krishna Iyer that ''every saint has a past and every sinner has a future\", Singh said the basic principle of the reformative theory emphasises on the renewal of the convict and the beginning of a new life for him. ''The petitioner is reaching the twilight of his lifetime but remains incarcerated, without any hope of him being released prematurely by the state government and thus, his right under Article 21 of the Constitution is being infringed,'' he said.

In his petition he says he has \"repented\", but for Christian representatives, the court's decision \"is really disturbing\" for the community.\n\nBhubaneswar (AsiaNews) - The Supreme Court of India has given the government of Odisha (Orissa) six weeks to respond to the request for clemency presented by Dara Singh, a Hindu extremist sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons.\n\nThe notice was issued two days ago by a panel of the court formed by Justices Hrishikesh Roy and SVN Bhatti.\n\nFollowing recent state elections in Odisha, the Hindu ultranationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in the eastern state with a tribal majority for the first time.\n\nIn 1999, Singh, a member of the Bajrang Dal, a Hindu far-right youth organisation, led a mob of fanatics to a station wagon where Staines and his sons Philip and Timothy, aged 10 and six, were sleeping, in the village of Manoharpur. The car was set on fire and the pastor and his two children were burnt alive because they were Christians.\n\nSingh was sentenced to death in 2003, but in 2005 the Orissa High Court commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and acquitted 11 other defendants, a sentence upheld by the Supreme Court in 2011.\n\nSingh, who is 61 now, wrote in the petition filed through his lawyer that he has already served 24 years in prison, that he had not been able to attend the last rites of his mother when she passed away, and that he has repented for his \"action taken in the fit of his youthful rage\".\n\nThe petition also refers to the Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed the early release of the people convicted for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, prime minister in the second half of the 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the early 2000s, Singh was also convicted of the murder of another priest working with the poor, Fr Arul Doss (killed with an arrow while he was at home) and two Muslim shopkeepers.\n\nChristian representatives in Odisha have expressed concern over the Supreme Court's notice to allow the local government, which is backed by the Bajrang Dal, to rule on Singh's early release.\n\n\"The fact that the Supreme Court issued this notice and is ready to hear [the petition] is really disturbing for us, because this is one of the rarest crimes, against humanity, not just against a family,\" said Fr Ajaya Kumar Singh, human rights activist in the Archdiocese of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar.\n\n\"The government should in no way show sympathy to this person because it could have other dangerous effects on the government and law and order. It would create mistrust and fear in the Christian community, not only in Orissa but throughout India.

The car was set on fire and the pastor and his two children were burnt alive because they were Christians.\n\nSingh was sentenced to death in 2003, but in 2005 the Orissa High Court commuted the sentence to life imprisonment and acquitted 11 other defendants, a sentence upheld by the Supreme Court in 2011.\n\nSingh, who is 61 now, wrote in the petition filed through his lawyer that he has already served 24 years in prison, that he had not been able to attend the last rites of his mother when she passed away, and that he has repented for his \"action taken in the fit of his youthful rage\".\n\nThe petition also refers to the Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed the early release of the people convicted for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, prime minister in the second half of the 1980s.\n\nHowever, in the early 2000s, Singh was also convicted of the murder of another priest working with the poor, Fr Arul Doss (killed with an arrow while he was at home) and two Muslim shopkeepers.\n\nChristian representatives in Odisha have expressed concern over the Supreme Court's notice to allow the local government, which is backed by the Bajrang Dal, to rule on Singh's early release.\n\n\"The fact that the Supreme Court issued this notice and is ready to hear [the petition] is really disturbing for us, because this is one of the rarest crimes, against humanity, not just against a family,\" said Fr Ajaya Kumar Singh, human rights activist in the Archdiocese of Cuttack-Bhubaneswar.\n\n\"The government should in no way show sympathy to this person because it could have other dangerous effects on the government and law and order. It would create mistrust and fear in the Christian community, not only in Orissa but throughout India. The government should not be inclined to give any favours to Singh,\" the clergyman said.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

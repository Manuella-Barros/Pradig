Dong highlighted the concept of building a community with a shared future for humanity, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative in his address. People in the Asia-Pacific are committed to pursuing harmony, are peace-loving, independent, self-reliant, and have always supported each other through thick and thin, he said. Dong called for drawing strength from \"Asian wisdom\" to build consensus and seek common ground while shelving differences. China is willing to work with all parties to protect the legitimate security interests of all countries, jointly build a more just and equitable international order, give full play to regional security architecture, advance open and substantive defense cooperation, set an example of maritime security cooperation, strengthen security governance in emerging areas to strive for new progress in regional security cooperation. Dong stressed that China values peace and harmony, and is committed to pursuing common security, equality and mutual respect, openness and inclusiveness, as well as safeguarding its core interests. Currently, the South China Sea has seen overall stability, Dong said, noting that a certain country should see where its true interests lie, and return to the right track of dialogue and consultation. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will take resolute actions to curb \"Taiwan independence\" and make sure such a plot never succeeds, he said. During the event, Dong also met with senior defense officials from the United States, Canada, Thailand, Japan, Australia, France, Cambodia and New Zealand. He also held talks with the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the high representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.", "summary": "<p>SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun delivered a speech on China's approach to global security on Sunday at the 21st Shangri-La Dialogue held in Singapore.</p><p> Dong highlighted the concept of building a community with a shared future for humanity, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative in his address.</p><p> People in the A", "url": "https://www.beijingbulletin.com/news/274392816/chinese-defense-minister-addresses-shangri-la-dialogue-on-china-approach-to-global-security", "image": "https://static.midwestradionetwork.com/story_logos/premier/beijing-bulletin.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:06:01", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "au", "sentiment": 0.46}

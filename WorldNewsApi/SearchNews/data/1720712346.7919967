Modi took the oath of office, administered by President Droupadi Murmu, at India\u2019s presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. The 73-year-old popular but polarising leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modi's National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm. This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/narendra-modi-swearing-in-ceremony-live-updates-898117", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/09/1095920-whatsappimage2024-06-09at193111427ce0fb.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:55:34", "author": "DC Correspondent", "authors": ["DC Correspondent"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.321}

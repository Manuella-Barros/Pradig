People want me to bring energy not just to the campaign trail, but also to solving some issues, including ones that have seemed intractable in the past, and that's my absolute determination. \u201cBut don't worry, we will have a general election, and I very much look forward to that in due course,\u201d he added. Mr Harris also took aim at Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald over what he described as \u201cunedifying\u201d comments about voters not understanding campaign issues. He described as a \u201cbit funny\u201d Ms McDonald\u2019s claim that the lead Opposition party didn\u2019t perform well at the polls because voters were angry with the Government. Mr Harris said the \u201cpenny has now dropped\u201d for Sinn F\u00e9in that they need to have \u201csolutions and policies\u201d if they want to lead government. \u201cI thought it was quite interesting that a few hours ago the leader of Sinn Fein, said, \u2018maybe we need to develop a few policies and be clear on what the policies and solutions are\u2019\u201d. \u201cSix years as leader of her party, two local election she's led her party through. I welcome the fact that there's a realisation now that politics isn't just about highlighting challenges, but it's about coming up with solutions,\u201d he added. \u201cThe second thing, I thought was rather unedifying today and quite insulting to the Irish people\u2026.I was very disappointed to hear her comments in relation to \u2018maybe the people on this occasion didn't really understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the second local elections that Mary Lou McDonald has had the honour of her leading her party into. It's the second local elections that have been an unmitigated disaster for them,\u201d he added. Mr Harris said he does \u201cnot get distracted\u201d by Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s \u201cleadership issues\u201d. He said Fine Gael is \u201cnot obsessed\u201d with Sinn F\u00e9in but said Sinn F\u00e9in should \u201cget obsessed about details\u201d and produce policies.", "summary": "<p>Taoiseach Simon Harris has dismissed calls to call a general election after the Coalition\u2019s success in the local elections.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/taoiseach-simon-harris-rules-out-early-general-election-despite-election-success-the-people-want-me-to-do-my-job/a1246362286.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/JUUlLlPXuVh-q4ueI7hEDsik8RM=/0x0:3238x2158/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/5728aa22-10f1-4521-b86c-5045cc1d25b4/e2880ede-6049-4792-884c-d15cffaa3032/5728aa22-10f1-4521-b86c-5045cc1d25b4.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:06:23", "author": "Philip Ryan", "authors": ["Philip Ryan"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.328}

{"id": 232061916, "title": "Coloradans want candidates to focus on good government and democracy &#8212; but that can mean many things", "text": "A lot of Coloradans are worried about our democracy. And they want candidates to pay attention to it, too. That is the message that comes through loud and clear from more than 4,500 responses to the Voter Voices survey that The Denver Post and dozens of other newsrooms around Colorado are circulating during this election year, as of last week. The effort has been coordinated by the Colorado News Collaborative. \u201cDemocracy/Good government\u201d was the top issue for voters who identified as moderate or liberal. For conservatives, it landed further down \u2014 a distant third after immigration and cost of living. But that simple selection covers a wide array of concerns, from money in politics to threats to personal liberties to politicians more worried about their careers than their constituents. Many voters expressed frustration that the current uncompromising tone of politics has made it increasingly impossible for the government \u2014 especially the federal government \u2014 to tackle what they see as the country\u2019s biggest problems. They said they want candidates to focus on the issues, instead of attacks, and to show they\u2019re willing to work with the other side. Deborah Shaffer of Cedaredge, in Delta County on the Western Slope, wrote that she wants candidates to talk about \u201chow they will move our country back to a centrist democracy and return to a spirit of compromise and cooperation so that the important issues of reasonable immigration, healthcare, fiscal responsibility, and the climate can be addressed.\u201d In an interview, Shaffer said she was disheartened; it had been a while since she felt like her federal votes were for a candidate she liked, instead of against one she feared. \u201cI\u2019m going to be very honest and say, if I had my way, I would not vote for a single incumbent,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cNot because I don\u2019t think there are good people. I just think it isn\u2019t working.\u201d Among the nearly 500 Denver Post survey-takers reflected in the statewide results, 45% identified democracy and good government as their most important issue when they selected from among 13 categories. It was the top issue for 51% of self-identified moderates and nearly 48% of liberals, but only 12% of conservatives \u2014 a group for whom the highest-ranking issue was the economy/cost of living (31%) followed by immigration (nearly 28%). Across the political spectrum, many respondents statewide said they just didn\u2019t believe the people elected to represent them truly cared about their concerns. The disillusionment and frustration expressed by Coloradans echo national trends; in a poll by Pew Research last year, 85% of respondents said politicians don\u2019t care what regular people think and 80% said they feel frustrated or angry with the government. The Voter Voices survey is also capturing the fears many voters \u2014 especially those who identify as liberal \u2014 have that the political opposition has evolved into a democratic threat. Melissa McInerney said she wanted to put climate change or health care or the environment at the top of her list of priorities, but for now, all those issues come second to her fears about what Republican control would mean for the federal government. \u201cThere are so many other issues that I actually care about and I also want to see addressed, but they\u2019re not going to mean a thing if we don\u2019t vote for the right party and the right people,\u201d said McInerney. Some favor more limited government For their part, many respondents who identified themselves as conservative cast good government as limited government \u2014 writing that candidates should focus on what they\u2019ll do to uphold the Constitution, especially the First and Second Amendments. \u201cHow they will give back freedoms to the people instead of taking it,\u201d is what Michael Ruff of Eaton, a town in Weld County, wants to hear from anyone seeking his vote. \u201cThe candidates are there to serve the people of Colorado, not to enact \u2018feel good laws\u2019 that usually have no effect, but instead, put over-reaching burdens and penalties on Citizens.\u201d Pessimism about the current political situation has Mike Orr of southwest Denver looking for big changes. He\u2019d like to see much tougher rules for money in politics and for the country to move toward ranked-choice voting. \u201cThe idea that someone who would otherwise have no shot at being in office could have a shot, and especially if that person maybe has somewhat more moderate views or is from some other party than Republicans and Democrats, that\u2019s huge to me,\u201d said Orr. Orr was one of nearly a dozen people in the survey who specifically brought up ranked-choice voting (RCV), an approach in which all candidates appear on the primary ballot, regardless of party, and voters rank them by preference. Colorado allows local governments to adopt RCV for their elections, and there is a move afoot to ask voters to expand the practice to state elections. Currently, only two states \u2014 Alaska and Maine \u2014 use RCV statewide. In addition to ranked-choice voting, respondents across the political spectrum suggested term limits would help improve federal politics. That\u2019s an idea the state has already embraced; most state-level officials may serve no more than eight years in office. Dissatisfaction has some voters considering leaving the major parties behind this year \u2014 either for a third party or an independent candidate like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Valerie LeGore in Routt County said she feels like the major parties and their candidates aren\u2019t respecting voters. \u201cWe need to up the quality of the conversation, rather than one candidate reading off the cue cards and another one calling people names,\u201d said LeGore. \u201cWe need to be really focused on the meat of the issues and the facts.\u201d For LeGore, good government starts with stringent election policies. A long-serving election judge, she believes county clerks do their best with the things that are within their control. But she distrusts many of Colorado\u2019s election innovations, like universal mail ballots and automatic voter registration. She\u2019d like to see the state move back to mostly in-person voting, with strict ID requirements. \u201cWe should be using the standards that we do for flying on airplanes and things like that,\u201d said LeGore, \u201cmaking sure people really are who they say they are.\u201d Without those policies in place, she feels like there\u2019s an asterisk on the results of every election. Confidence in elections When it comes to confidence in elections, the Voter Voices survey reflects national trends. Only 11% of conservatives who filled out the survey said they are fully confident the election will be conducted fairly across the country. In contrast, just over 50% of liberals and moderates said they have faith in the national election. Views are more positive across the board when it comes to Colorado\u2019s handling of the vote. About 90% of liberals, 80% of moderates and 40% of conservatives said they fully trust votes will be counted fairly in their community. While the survey is not a scientific poll, what it does make clear is that when voters say they want candidates to focus on democracy and good government, what they really mean spans the gamut of views and concerns. But it also lays bare a common thread \u2014 that they\u2019re worried the nation\u2019s current political leaders are failing to meet the challenges of the moment. Shaffer, the Cedaredge voter who said that if she had her way she wouldn\u2019t vote for any incumbent, said she\u2019s not a very emotional person. But reflecting on the current political moment brings her to the verge of tears. At 74, her fears are really for the coming generations. \u201cI just feel so bad for people who are looking at this and saying, \u2018Well, what\u2019s my life going to be like under these circumstances?\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI do believe in the ability of humanity to ultimately do the right thing. I just feel that right now it\u2019s looking dim instead of hopeful.\u201d Tina Griego is the managing editor of the Colorado News Collaborative, which is leading the Voter Voices project.

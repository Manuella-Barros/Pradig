The Ernakulam First Class Magistrate Court filed a complaint against the film's production company, Parava Films, and their partner, Shawn Antony. They mentioned that the film's producers did not share the 40% profit from its earnings as promised.\n\nThe complainant, Siraj Valiyathara Hameed, alleged that the makers did not share the film's profit. As per the FIR, the production company of Manjummel Boys did not pay back the invested amount, approximately $2.6 million. Moreover, the complainant transferred around $718.8k to the bank account belonging to Parava Films.\n\nAdditionally, he transferred about $60k to Antony. Collectively, the complainant lent about $840k to the film's producers. His share of the profit has allegedly come out to be $4.8 million. Given the circumstances, the court has frozen the accounts of the film producers. Moreover, the police claimed Antony is the main accused.\n\nThis might ignite controversy surrounding the film's financial circumstances.

One Siraj Valiyathara Hameed has reportedly lodged a complaint alleging that the producers failed to share profits as agreed. The Ernakulam First Class Magistrate Court has instructed the police to file a case against Parava Films and their associate Shawn Antony on Tuesday, reported The Hindu.\n\nHelmed by Chidambaram, the film was released theatrically on February 22. It made history as the first Malayalam film to surpass the \u20b9200cr mark, emerging as the highest-grossing Malayalam film to date. Additionally, it claimed the title of the highest-grossing Malayalam film of 2024, both domestically and internationally. The film featured an ensemble cast including Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi, Balu Varghese, Ganapathi S Poduval, Lal Jr, and Deepak Parambol in pivotal roles.\n\nHameed alleged that he was promised a 40% share in profits if he funded the film's production cost, which totaled \u20b922cr. He claims to have transferred \u20b95.99cr to Parava Films and an additional \u20b950 lakh to producer Shawn Antony's account. Further, the complainant stated that he loaned them \u20b951 lakh in cash over time, bringing his total investment to \u20b97cr. Despite this substantial financial contribution, Hameed contends that he has not received any returns or his promised profit share.\n\nThe film reportedly earned a staggering \u20b9250cr from box office sales, OTT, and satellite rights. The non-payment of Hameed's initial investment and the additional \u20b940cr of promised profit forms the basis of the cheating case. In response to these allegations, the court has ordered a freeze on the producers' accounts and named Antony as the primary defendant. The charges filed against the producers include cheating and conspiracy, indicating a potential legal showdown for those involved with Manjummel Boys.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Malayalam cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_Malayalam_films", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of highest-grossing Malayalam films"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chidambaram", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chidambaram"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chidambaram"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernakulam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ernakulam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ernakulam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_S._Poduval", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ganapathi S.

This move came in response to a petition filed by Siraj Valiyathara of Aroor. Siraj accused the producers, Parava Films and partner Shawn Antony, of pledging to grant him a 40 percent slice of the profits following the film's release, citing his hefty investment of Rs 7 crore in the venture.\n\nIn his plea, Siraj claimed that the other producers backed out of their commitments and neglected their financial responsibilities, including reimbursing the funds he injected into the film.\n\nBased on a report by OnManorama, as per the petitioner's account, he was approached by the partners of M/s Parava Films LLP to invest in a movie featuring Soubin and other talents. Trusting the assurances and pledges of the accused, the petitioner inked an agreement with Parava Films on November 30, 2022, to invest 7 crore in staggered payments towards the venture. Additionally, he asserted that despite being led to believe that the movie's budget was a total investment that amounted to 22 crore, the actual investment fell short of 10 crore, with the petitioner contributing a total of 7 crore.\n\nAccording to The Hindu, the complainant transferred 5.99 crore to Parava Films' account and 50 lakh to Mr. Antony's account, with an additional 51 lakh collected in cash, totalling 7 crore borrowed.

Most of their films that have been released in theatres so far have received lots of appreciation and earned big numbers at the box office. One such movie is Manjummel Boys, which was released in theatres on February 22, 2024. It's a survival thriller helmed by Chidambaram, who previously directed Jan E Man.\n\nThe movie is based on the tragic story of 2006, when a group of friends found themselves trapped in Kodaikanal's Guna caves. The star cast includes Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi, Balu Varghese, Ganapathi S Poduval, Lal Jr., Deepak Parambol, Abhiram Radhakrishnan, Arun Kurian, Khalid Rahman, Chandu Salimkumar, Shebin Benson, and Vishnu Reghu.\n\nAfter two months, the movie will finally arrive on the Disney+ Hotstar streaming platform. However, it is still running in several theatres. The cherry on the cake is, along with the huge box office numbers, the makers got a good amount for its OTT rights. As reported by the 123 Telugu web portal, the OTT rights of Manjummel Boys are sold for an enormous amount of Rs 20 crores. What's interesting is the film's budget is the same.\n\nIt's a big feat for the Chidambaram-directed movie, which is still minting numbers at the box office. According to a recent update, the survival thriller has earned over 235.16 crore gross worldwide. Even after two months, the love for the Malayalam movie has not stopped pouring in. The movie was also released in theatres a month ago with Telugu dubbing. Even the Telugu version is doing well at the box office. Furthermore, regarding its OTT release, the movie will stream on Disney+ Hotstar on May 3, 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, just like Manjummel Boys, other movies that have grabbed attention and have performed exceptionally well at the box office are Premalu, Aadujeevitham - The Goat Life and Fahadh Faasil's recently released comedy film, Aavesham.", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pooja_darade@koimoi.com", "name": "Pooja Darade", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-top media service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+_Hotstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+ Hotstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malayalam cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malayalam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapathi_S._Poduval", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ganapathi S.

Here's Where & When To Watch This Malayalam Super-Hit", "body": "Manjummel Boys, a blockbuster hit not only in Kerala but also resonating across other states, is gearing up for its OTT release. This survival drama, inspired by true events, unfolds the story of a group of friends facing adversity during their vacation at the Guna Caves in 2006. These friends, hailing from an art club in Kochi, embarked on an exhilarating journey to Kodaikanal, a picturesque town nestled in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. While immersing themselves in the breathtaking landscapes of Kodaikanal, one of them shared an intriguing anecdote about the enigmatic Guna Caves, immortalized in the iconic film \"Gunaa.\" Upon arrival at the caves, they encountered an unexpected obstruction of the original entrance. Undeterred, they chose to venture forth, only for one of them to accidentally fall into the cave, sending shockwaves of panic through the rest of the group.\n\nIn his second film, Manjummel Boys, Chidambaram presents a star-studded cast featuring Soubin Shahir, Sreenath Bhasi, Balu Varghese, Ganapathy, Jean Paul Lal, Deepak Parambol and others. He brings a refreshing cinematic approach by avoiding clich\u00e9s and prioritizing genuine character growth. While the film initially maintains a lively atmosphere, it seamlessly transitions to a more subdued tone as the narrative unfolds, especially upon reaching the Guna caves, where the haunting ambience becomes prominent.\n\nAjayan Chalissery's meticulous production design, particularly in creating the atmospheric bat-filled ravine, combined with Shyju Khalid's captivating rescue scene visuals and complemented by Sushin Shyam's emotive background score, deeply engages viewers in the narrative.\n\nManjummel Boys has taken the cinema scene by storm, smashing records all over! As of April 17, 2024, its Indian box office haul stands at a whopping 137 crores in net collections, with a gross of 161.66 crores. And that's not all! It's raked in an impressive 73.50 crores overseas, bringing its worldwide gross to a staggering 235.16 crores. With these numbers, Manjummel Boys has cemented its place as the ultimate Malayalam blockbuster, leaving even the previous record-holder, \"2018\" behind.\n\nRead the detailed report on box office:\n\nThe film will make its OTT debut on Disney Plus Hotstar on May 3, 2024, in Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, and Telugu. While the platform has yet to officially announce the release date, our industry sources strongly indicate that it is virtually confirmed.\n\nMust Read: Indian 2: Kamal Haasan's Sequel Arrives After

There are reportedly more interesting products on the way, including various memory solutions, and the focus is entirely on being able to support data centers as the era of AI progresses. According to Tom's Hardware, SK Hynix's market researchers claim that the global volume of data generated on a yearly basis is on an upward trend, and the increase is truly like nothing we've ever seen before. SK Hynix predicts that we'll see a jump up to 660 zettabytes (ZB), up from 15ZB in 2014.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nTo give some context to that number, 660ZB equals 660 billion terabytes. Back in 2018, studies estimated that around 175ZB of data would be generated globally in 2025, but it's easy to imagine that this number may have changed with the recent AI boom.\n\nRelated SSD buying guide: how to pick the right SSD for your needs in 2023 SK Hynix might dethrone Western Digital with this SSD Micron's new tiny 2TB SSD is bad news for laptop HDDs\n\nNo matter the current state of global data generation, the demand is only going to go up from here, so SK Hynix isn't really jumping ahead of the curve -- it's just paving a path for many other companies to follow with massive SSDs to support AI workloads in datacenters. Both high-capacity HDDs and SSDs are necessary.\n\nUnfortunately, not much is known about the 300TB SSD as of yet, other than that it's in the works. Tom's Hardware speculates that the drive may rival Samsung's PBSSD initiative (which tops out at 240TB right now and is offered on a subscription basis) or ExaDrive's 100TB SSD, which, while a solid-state drive, comes encased in a 3.5-inch chassis, so it resembles an HDD. It also costs $40,000.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the kind of performance an SSD of this size might be able to offer, and that's something that SK hynix will have to tackle before the launch. Achieving a good balance of capacity, speed, and reliability is bound to be difficult with a drive of this size -- but it's clear that these solutions are a necessity, as we're still in the early days of the AI era.\n\nEditors' Recommendations How much does an AI supercomputer cost?

Not long ago we saw how certain companies were developing technology to offer hard drives that exceeded the 30 TB barrier, but now, SK Hynix wants to offer ten times more storage in a SSD.\n\nOne of the big problems that companies are currently having is how to store the millions of data that are generated daily, something that, due to the evolution of AI in recent years, is increasingly becoming a problem. a more serious problem. The space consumption of artificial intelligence is something that has many companies in check, since within six years it is expected that these systems will generate an amount of data that will exceed 660 zettabytes, an extremely high amount considering Keep in mind that until 2014, humanity had generated an amount of 15 zettabytes of data.", "source": {"uri": "gearrice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gearrice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://hardzone.es/app/uploads-hardzone.es/2024/05/300TB.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538629", "eventUri": "eng-9538629", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8113833741", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-06", "time": "13:03:14", "dateTime": "2024-05-06T13:03:14Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-06T13:02:54Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "url": "https://www.techradar.com/gaming/a-1tb-ps5-ssd-was-the-sweet-spot-for-boosting-your-consoles-storage-heres-why-thats-no-longer-true", "title": "A 1TB PS5 SSD was the sweet spot for boosting your console's storage - here's why that's no longer true", "body": "One of the PlayStation 5's greatest assets is that you can boost its storage with an off-the-shelf M.2 solid-state drive. All the drive has to do is meet a few reasonable requirements and you can pick what you want to expand your console's capacity.\n\nI was a big advocate for 1TB being perfect for everyone ever since we knew about the PS5's SSD bay. In the run-up to the firmware update that made the SSD bay usable, and in the months - and years - that followed I was utterly confident that 1TB was the absolute sweet spot. It was plentiful in terms of its literal storage space being both enough for a big library, and not ridiculously large (who is honestly playing 4TB or 8TBs worth of games?), and the prices were agreeable without being outrageous.\n\nHowever, in 2024, I think the tide has turned when it comes to the best SSDs for PS5. It feels as though a single terabyte of extra PS5 storage, while certainly serviceable, just doesn't cut it anymore and 2TB is now where it's at.\n\nWith game sizes increasing with every release season, ever-expanding live-service games, as well as having to reinstall big beasts for new expansions, or revisit classics from previous generations through remasters, and some incredible blockbusters which offer immense replayability and continual exploration, 2TB of storage is flat-out fast becoming a necessity when looking for more console storage.\n\nA big part of the need for 2TB now is due to the simple influence of old Father Time. However, there's a little more to it than 'more time = more games', and it's a bit more nuanced than that.\n\nYes, there are more games than ever for the PS5 because we're now deep into its fourth year, or as Sony puts it, the \"latter half of the PS5's life cycle\". Games are still being released for PS4 too, which also contributes to this massive, growing library given the PS5's ability to play PS4 games via backwards compatibility.\n\nBut it's the size and ambition of these games that make them more extraordinary and thus have a bigger impact on our consoles' storage. More of these games are exceptional, incredibly engrossing, and highly replayable, making them titles you want to keep to hand for longer - Baldur's Gate 3 and its 108GB file size is a perfect example. Games like it are the ones you'll keep installed for a very long time, always taking up precious, though well-earned, hard drive space.\n\nRecent games like Diablo 4 are absolutely worth keeping installed with their seasonal content and plentiful reasons to keep jumping back in. Meanwhile, Sea of Thieves (60+GB when I downloaded it the other day) has just launched on PS5 too, which has a chunky install size and is only going to get larger with time and extra content.\n\nSingle-player games in the past year or so have been exceptional too. Adventures like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (nearly 90GB) and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (a whopping 150-odd GB) are massive, and have new game plus modes or open worlds to keep going in. Meanwhile, huge solo games like Dragon's Dogma 2 (60+GB) are games that will keep folks entertained for months.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of fighting games or sports too? Better throw in your title of choice here from the last year or so, squeezing in another space-demanding beast or two.\n\nWe're in the age of the remasters this generation too, as well as opportunities to revisit colossal games. The former has seen some huge hits allowing us to dip into previous generations in pretty spectacular ways. Dead Space (30GB), Resident Evil 4 (58GB), and The Last of Us Part I, and Part 2 Remastered (both around 80GB) are all heftily-sized bangers requiring a healthy amount of storage.\n\nHowever, other big games have seen new breaths of life through expansions and add-ons that make them worthy of hard drive space once again, years after their initial release. Want to jump into Kratos' roguelike Valhalla DLC? Better reinstall all of God of War Ragnarok (c.85GB). Keen to check out Phantom Liberty? That'll be all of Cyberpunk 2077 (c.90GB) reinstalled then.\n\nThrow in your enormous live service games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 (an enormous 235GB) or Call of Duty Warzone (reported to be 173GB to download from scratch earlier this year by users), and Apex Legends (70+GB on my PS5 right now). That's all a recipe for a full-to-bursting hard drive. We used to make throwaway, but genuinely accurate, remarks about needing an SSD just for Call of Duty; it's now the case that many folks will need extra storage for Call of Duty and everything else.\n\nIf file sizes continue to creep up, and this mix of release 'types' keeps going, then, from a practical sense alone, it makes 2TB drives a more worthwhile investment.\n\nAnother attraction of a 2TB drive is that the prices on them have dropped considerably. However, price cuts aren't the only positive here: it's the resulting value they offer - how much you get for your cash - that makes them truly worth consideration.\n\nThey're not necessarily double the price of a 1TB drive, as they have been in prior years. They're now often far, far less than the price of two single terabyte drives combined. Over deals seasons we have even seen 2TB PS5 SSDs drop to or just below the $100 / \u00a3100 mark which is incredible value for money.\n\nHowever, even in leaner times, like recent months, when 1TB SSDs have stubbornly held their price of around $100 / \u00a3100, a 2TB SSD that costs $150 / \u00a3150 or even $170 / \u00a3170 is a no-brainer on the value front. Bagging the second terabyte in particular for less than a 1TB drive is the best part of the value on offer.\n\nWhile the number of excellent games does take a toll on storage nowadays, the other side of the coin when it comes to 1TB now not being enough, or getting dangerously close to not enough, is that 2TB will offer some futureproofing; not least due to the extra headroom it offers.\n\nAnd with a PS5 Pro very likely on the horizon, there's more cause than ever for extra room. We know games that were enhanced for the PS4 Pro were often larger in file size, and that's likely to be the same with a PS5 Pro. Throw in some PS5 Pro patches for existing PS5 games and we'll be swimming in data once again. I haven't even mentioned GTA 6 yet either...\n\nThe truth is that something like a 1.5TB would be the next sweet spot. But in the face of no such drive existing, it's clear that a 2TB capacity PS5 SSD and its extra headroom is the optimal capacity for what is still the best PS5 accessory you can get.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Replay value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us Part I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_2_(2023_video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man 2 (2023 video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dead Space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Survivor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur's_Gate_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baldur's Gate III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Thieves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea of Thieves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diablo (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resident Evil 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Game_Plus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Game Plus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_(God_of_War)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kratos (God of War)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yLjXrK6J2GMhYzLbdgfcTg-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538629", "eventUri": "eng-9538629", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

However, as we showed a few months ago, that trend has reversed.\n\nWith employees returning to the office after the pandemic, NAND manufacturers faced an oversupply of chips and consequently reduced production. Nevertheless, demand has continued to soar, especially with current-gen games recommending or even requiring SSD storage.\n\nAdditionally, the AI race has become a significant factor, with models requiring vast amounts of data for training, which is also starting to affect disk drive prices.\n\nFor our previous SSD pricing update (Q1/24), we selected some of the most popular SSDs across three different capacities and analyzed how their average prices on Amazon have fluctuated over the past year. Now is the time to see how things have changed since then.\n\nThe SK Hynix P41 Platinum is arguably the fastest 500GB drive on the market. While some of its competitors start at 1TB, the question remains: Is it a good deal? A year ago, it cost $105. At one point, it could be had for just $41, but more often it sold for $66. Now, it's selling for $83.\n\nFor those buying multiple 500GB drives to upgrade several systems, these price fluctuations are significant.\n\nThe Corsair MP600 Pro is a drive we recommend for its sustained write speed. The 500GB version has fewer NAND chips, which halves the speed compared to higher-capacity versions, but it remains a decent option. The PlayStation 5-optimized LPX version started at $76 at the beginning of 2023, often sold for $53, and now goes for $70.\n\nThe Samsung 970 Evo Plus is an excellent choice for systems that only support PCIe 3.0 speeds. It began last year at $70, dropped to as low as $25, and more commonly sold for $30. It's now back up to $75.\n\nThe Samsung 870 Evo is a good alternative to the Crucial MX500. A year ago, it cost $60, but since then, it was available for $30, more often for $40, and now it's back to $60, exceeding the price of the Crucial drive.\n\nMoving on to 1TB drives allows us to add several drives and models to the comparison. The Samsung 990 Pro used to cost $170 a year ago, dropped to $60, and then stabilized around $80 for a few months. It now costs $120.\n\nAnother high-end PCIe 4.0 drive, the WD Black SN850X, was about $110 in January 2023, and for a while it could be had for $60. For several months it was stable at $85, but in the past month things have deteriorated, and now it's $100.\n\nMeanwhile, the SK Hynix P41 Platinum was $150 a year ago, but for most of 2023 it remained at $90, with dips as low as $55. It now goes for $100, making its 500GB version look redundant.\n\nThe Corsair MP600 Pro LPX started last year at a reasonable $110 and spent much of the year at around $70. It now costs $90.\n\nThe WD Black SN770 has been a decent option for those with a PCIe 4.0 system looking to save money. Starting last year at $90, it remained at around $50 for several months, with its lowest dip at $43. It has fluctuated on a rising pattern and now it's stable at $85.\n\nThe Samsung T7 Shield is an external SSD that we've been recommending for over a year. It used to cost $100, and later was available around $75 to $90. These days, it's usually $110.\n\nThe Crucial MX500 1TB started last year at $70, but spent much of the year under $50. Now it sits at $90 - a price it hasn't seen since 2022. The Samsung 870 Evo is a similar story: a year ago, it was too expensive compared to the MX500 at $90. During the year it became a stronger competitor with prices under $60, down as much as $49. In January it became overpriced again at $90, and as of writing it's $100, but now the Crucial drive is catching up.\n\nThroughout last year we noted that 2TB drives offered better value than lower-capacity models, but in the past few months, price changes created some exceptions. Has this trend continued? Let's find out.\n\nThe Samsung 990 Pro used to cost $300 a year ago, but for a few months it was available for less than half that amount, including a $120 Black Friday deal. For the past few weeks its price has been stable around $190 - that's significantly better value than the 1TB model if you need the space.\n\nThe WD Black SN850X started 2023 at a more sensible $190, and for a while it could be had for just $110. Current prices are about $150, so the 1TB model looks worse than it did last time.\n\nThe SK Hynix P41 Platinum was $260 at the start of 2023, but spent most of the year at least $100 cheaper, including a few weeks at $115 towards the year's end. The price was much higher last January at $140-160 and now has increased further to sit at $170. That's still a better value than the 1TB model, but not by much.\n\nThe Corsair MP600 Pro LPX was often available for $130 or less throughout 2023, dipping as low as $110. Last month, the price fluctuated between $150 and $165, making the larger capacity still a better deal than the 1TB model, though not by much.\n\nThe WD Black SN770 started last year at $160 but fluctuated around $100 later on. Early this year, it was listed at $140 but was frequently discounted to $107, making it a significantly better value than the 1TB model. Now, those deals are no longer available.\n\nThe Samsung T7 Shield has seen a long history of price fluctuations. Starting the year at around $170, it often sold for around $125, with the lowest price at $100. Now it's at $180, making the 1TB model still relevant in the market, even though it offers technically worse value.\n\nThe Crucial MX500 remained one of the most consistently priced drives last year, starting at $150, but never costing more than $120. It fluctuated between $90 and $110, dipping to $80 around Black Friday. Now at $160, it's not significantly better than the 1TB version.\n\nThe Samsung 870 Evo also went from being overpriced compared to the MX500 at $175, to a good alternative with prices between $100 and $120, and short dips to $90 and $80. Gone up to $180, it's an unappealing option for most.\n\nThe SSD price drops from last year have completely reversed. A concerning trend in the past few months is the disappearance of good value options like the Crucial MX500 or the frequent sales of the WD SN770. This trend is not limited to specific brands or capacities, and we don't recommend settling for drives with slower and less durable QLC flash.\n\nThe question remains: How much worse will it get? We don't expect a return to 2021 prices, created by shortages and supply chain issues. At some point, people will start buying fewer units, and manufacturers are trying not to reach that point. Prices are likely to decrease eventually as production ramps up and new technologies are introduced. If you don't urgently need a new SSD, there's no benefit in acquiring one preemptively, just to avoid possible future price hikes.\n\nYour choice of storage device and its intended use also play crucial roles. For desktop PC users looking to store large quantities of photos and videos, a traditional hard drive remains a viable alternative, but you may want to get one soon before the AI craze reaches those, too.\n\nFor instance, the Seagate IronWolf often sells for just $80 for 4TB. Laptop users who don't mind carrying an additional, smaller external drive might consider the WD Passport, which currently offers 2TB for around $80. For PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series owners, such drives can play older games, albeit with longer load times.\n\nWe'll report back next quarter with more SSD pricing updates.", "source": {"uri": "techspot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amir_shoam@techspot.com", "name": "Amir Shoam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flash memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solid-state drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PCI Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsair_Gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corsair Gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK_Hynix", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SK Hynix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disk storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Friday (shopping)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_data_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer data storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagate_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seagate Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.techspot.com/articles-info/2835/images/2024-05-05-image-6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538629", "eventUri": "eng-9538629", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

However, we found a strong linear relationship between the radiograph severity grade and time to TB diagnosis among participants 16-24 years of age (mean difference of -0.004 [95% CI -0.007 to -0.001]; n = 12) but not among older persons (Figure 4). We also did not find an association between severity grade and time to incident TB among persons with no known TB history (mean difference of 0.002 [95% CI -0.006 to 0.001]; n = 19) (Appendix Figure 6).\n\nIn this study, we found that among persons >15 years of age who were exposed to TB at home, those who were initially deemed TB-free but had an abnormal baseline chest radiograph had a 15-fold higher risk for incident TB developing during 12 months of follow-up than did persons with an unremarkable radiograph. That finding was more pronounced in household contacts with no TB history and in younger participants, who were less likely to have residual abnormalities on radiograph from past TB or other comorbidities. Our findings remained unaltered in multivariate models when we further adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, as well as history of comorbidity. Among young persons with abnormal radiograph who were initially deemed TB-free at baseline, incident TB developed in 50% during follow-up. The severity grade of radiograph abnormalities was a strong indicator of an early-state TB trajectory in young persons.\n\nAlthough numerous investigators have examined the use of chest radiography in screening for clinically apparent TB, few have evaluated whether abnormal radiographs could help identify early TB. The idea of using chest radiograph examination for incipient pulmonary TB was first proposed by Dr. Francis Williams, the father of chest radiology in the United States, in 1899 (23). Chest radiography for mass screening and active case-finding for pulmonary TB was recommended by the New York City Health Department in the United States as early as the 1920s-1930s (24,25) and was widely implemented in industrialized countries in the 1940s-1960s, contributing to the success of TB control in developed countries (3,26). However, by the late 1960s, WHO no longer recommended active case finding through mass radiograph screening for developing countries because of financial constraints (27). Not until 2015 was chest radiograph screening re-recommended by WHO as part of the end TB strategy (1,27). Even today, radiograph screening remains inaccessible in resource-limited areas in many low- and middle-income countries. Screening criteria typically focus on previously underdiagnosed TB disease, which is known as the late stage of TB disease (26). As a consequence, the very early stage of TB, known as subclinical TB, which is characterized by minimal or atypical presentations on chest radiograph, could still be underrecognized.\n\nNonetheless, our findings are consistent with several previous studies. In a study conducted in Czechoslovakia among a district-level cohort of 7,800 adults followed during 1961-1964 (28), 44% of persons in whom incident TB developed during follow-up had a previous abnormal chest radiograph indicating inactive TB or a fibrotic lesion. In a cohort study conducted during 1950-1952 in Denmark, persons with fibrotic lesions and shadows suspicious of TB on chest radiograph had a >10-fold higher annual rate of subsequent TB during the follow-up period (29). Similarly, in cohort studies conducted in 1988 among Southeast Asian refugees in Seattle (30) and in the early 1980s among recent Asian immigrants to northern Canada (31), persons with radiograph abnormalities indicative of or interpreted as inactive TB had 6-fold higher and 19-fold higher risk for subsequent TB. Those studies demonstrate that different types of lesions on baseline radiograph are associated with varying risks of subsequent TB in different mass screening settings. In a 1981 study from Hong Kong, 176 smear- and culture-negative adults with TB-compatible lesions were monitored for up to 30 months (32). Of those, TB was eventually diagnosed in 30%; most cases occurred within the first 12 months of follow-up. Similarly, a 1985 study conducted in South Africa found that among 152 TST-positive gold miners with evolving apical lung lesions on baseline radiograph who were smear- and culture-negative, bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB developed in 58% during a 58-month follow-up period (33). In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of 34 cohorts observed in the prechemotherapy era of persons with untreated TB who underwent follow-up, progression from microbiologically negative to positive disease was observed at an annualized rate of 10% in those with initial radiographs suggestive of active TB and at a rate of 1% in those initially suggestive of inactive TB (12). Although the incidence rate in this systemic review is lower than in our study, only 1 of the studies cited previously focused on a cohort of household contacts with known exposure to TB. The higher incidence in our study might be because we did not require microbiological confirmation to classify incident disease.\n\nThe finding that chest radiography might help identify pathological changes before the onset of TB symptoms aligns with recent evidence from South Africa. Esmail et al. (34) followed 250 HIV-negative adults exposed to TB at home for >4.7 years. Among 14 persons in whom active disease developed during follow-up, 6 exhibited baseline abnormalities on computed tomography/positron emission tomography (34). The TB research community now widely acknowledges that TB follows a dynamic continuum, encompassing TB infection, asymptomatic incipient or subclinical TB, and symptomatic clinically manifested disease (7-10). A 1982 study by the International Union Against Tuberculosis Committee on Prophylaxis revealed that among 28,000 adults with radiograph-identified fibrotic pulmonary lesions compatible with TB, a 24-week regimen of isoniazid preventive treatment decreased tuberculosis incidence by 65% compared with the placebo group over a 5-year follow-up period (35). Those findings suggest that lung changes can be observed in the asymptomatic phase of TB. Given that the cost of computed tomography/positron emission tomography makes it impractical for many screening programs, radiography could play a pivotal role in early TB detection, enabling early interventions such as close follow-up, preventive therapy, or full-dose combination therapy in populations at risk.\n\nOur study revealed that young persons 16-24 years of age with abnormal baseline chest radiograph had a 3-fold higher risk for TB than older adults with abnormal radiograph. The observed association between the severity of baseline radiograph abnormalities and the trajectory of early TB disease within this young age group further supports the notion that an abnormal radiograph might serve as an indicator of undiagnosed or subclinical TB in this specific population, whereas older adults are more likely to have abnormal radiographs caused by non-TB lung diseases. That notion is supported by 2 cross-sectional studies conducted in Malawi during 2018-2020 (36) and the 2016 Kenya national TB prevalence survey (37). Both those studies reported a high prevalence of non-TB abnormalities on chest radiographs among older adults, with the proportion increasing with age.\n\nThe first limitation of this study is that only 40% of TST-positive adults received a baseline radiograph independent of symptoms; the decision to request a radiograph was made by local health center clinicians. Second, we lacked lateral positioning radiographs, which might have led to misclassifications of abnormalities. Third, readings were initially blinded for the first reader, and only abnormal radiographs were subsequently validated by a second reader who was not blinded. Therefore, misclassification of findings could have occurred. The fact that the second reader only read the films initially deemed to be abnormal and was not blinded to this classification might have resulted in overidentifying abnormalities in keeping with the first reader's interpretations, leading to inflated measures of inter-rater agreement and consequently overestimating the effect size of the association between abnormalities and subsequent TB disease. Because the radiographs initially read as unremarkable were not read by a second reader, some of those might have been classified as abnormal if all radiographs had been read. Fourth, the relatively high prevalence of previous TB history among household contacts raises the possibility that some abnormal baseline radiographs were a result of inadequately treated previous TB or residual, minimally active TB. We did not have previous treatment or drug sensitivity information for those contacts and so cannot rule out the possibility that a history of TB might contribute to the elevated risk for incident TB among those persons. However, we also observed that persons with TB history were less likely to undergo baseline examinations. Moreover, when we excluded those with TB history from the 1,747 contacts who underwent radiograph screening, we found that the effect size increased by 30%. Finally, health center clinicians were expected to follow the clinical diagnosis guidelines outlined by Peru's National TB Program, but different clinicians might have applied varying criteria for TB diagnosis. The absence of a standardized set of criteria for TB diagnosis might have resulted in nondifferential misclassification, potentially influencing the results toward a null effect.\n\nOverall, our study revealed a significant association between abnormal baseline chest radiograph results and subsequent diagnosis of TB among asymptomatic adults with recent TB exposure. The severity of baseline radiograph results also reflected the early TB progression trajectory. Our findings strongly support the wide use of chest radiography with computer-aided detection as a screening tool in exposed adults and prompt the development of accurate criteria and algorithms for human and artificial intelligence readers to effectively identify early TB states beyond active TB disease, leading to timely intervention and proper management.", "source": {"uri": "wwwnc.cdc.gov",

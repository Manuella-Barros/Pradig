{"id": 243337978, "title": "Nigel Hinds/LABA Senior League final\u2026Unbeaten Royals collide with Jets tonight - Guyana Chronicle", "text": "VICTORY Valley Royals are the prohibitive favourites to continue their dominance and walk away with the hefty $400,000 winners\u2019 purse in tonight\u2019s final of the Nigel Hinds/ Linden Amateur Basketball Senior League championship. Hosts Amelia\u2019s Ward Jets are in a prime position to upset those hopes when this evening\u2019s final gets cracking at the Amelia\u2019s Ward Hard Court. The Royals are widely regarded as the national club champions after their Guyana Amateur Basketball Federation (GABF)\u2019s \u2018Reds\u2019 Big 4 final\u2019s victory over Georgetown\u2019s Colts last year. That, in addition to having scored a commanding 84-59 win when the two teams met in the preliminary round of play, puts them in the pole position to lift the title. Key to the national success last year and now are senior national players Harold Adams, Orlan Glasgow, and Yannick Tappin, and their combined efforts have allowed them to be unbeaten so far in this championship. With an expectant home crowd coming out to see the hosts put up a great showing, the Jets, playing on their familiar surface, are looking to create an upset win. Their top players will be Quincy Easton, a young promising player, Dennis Niles (Jr.), and Leon Benjamin, who are all in form. According to President of the LABA Mrs. Dawn McCammon-Barker, Nigel Hinds Financial Services is the major sponsor of this tournament, and others who have come forward are Aubrey \u2018Shanghai\u2018 Major, Twenty/20 Bar, United States-based former national captain James Brusche, and Gary Stephens. However, before this final between Royals and Jets, there will be the third-place playoff game between Retrieve Raiders and Block 22 Flames at 18.00hrs. Admission is $1,000.

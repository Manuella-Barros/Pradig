Here's what we know so far.\n\nHundreds of passengers are stranded across the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand after carrier Air Vanuatu grounded scores of flights at the last minute.\n\nPlagued by technical faults for several months, the airline filed for insolvency on Monday, with an administrator yet to be named.\n\nThe Port Vila-headquartered national carrier published a list of 20 affected services, including four cancelled Auckland flights, blaming mechanical issues.\n\nA travel advisory published by the airline last night blamed \"extended maintenance requirements\" for the delay. \"We are working with our partner carriers to minimise the disruption to our guests.\"\n\nThere has been no update on replacement flights for affected passengers.\n\nOne Kiwi traveller stranded on the island of Espiritu Santo with his wife said they and scores of fellow passengers were still waiting for more information.\n\n\"We've heard nothing at all, except [the flights] have all been cancelled,\" he told the Herald.\n\nDue to the airline's routes, the affected passengers were mostly Australians and New Zealanders. The traveller said he had been hoping to fly via Brisbane back to Auckland, but all the regional departures had also been grounded.\n\nThere had been several groundings and \"non-stop issues for several months\", but he noted it was odd for no flights to be taking off at all.\n\nWith only one 737 aircraft, the airline is extremely exposed to mechanical issues, and this is not the first time faults have halted operations. However, regional links operated on Air Vanuatu turboprop planes appear also to have been grounded.\n\nLocal media have also reported on the airline's ongoing money problems, as well as technical ones.\n\nYesterday Vanuatu's Daily Post confirmed Air Vanuatu's board of directors had been dissolved and the airline had begun the process of voluntary administration.\n\nThe board was formally dissolved after appointing an administrator on Monday, May 6. The Post reported consultancy firm Ernst & Young had been asked to address the airline's insolvency issues, with an invitation from Prime Minister's Office director-general Cherol Ala.\n\nA spokesperson for Air Vanuatu confirmed that consultants Ernst & Young have been appointed to assist the Vanuatu Government with the administration of the airline's affairs.\n\n\"Ernst & Young representatives arrived in Port Vila today to begin an assessment of Air Vanuatu's financials and are being assisted by the Vanuatu Government and the Air Vanuatu team.\"\n\nAll flights through to this Sunday, May 12, have been cancelled, they said, with all further services subject to review.\n\nAffected Air Vanuatu passengers and airline partners are advised to monitor the Vanuatu Travel Advisory website for updates.\n\nContacted by the New Zealand Herald about the matter, the Vanuatu Tourism Office said it was aware of reports that Air Vanuatu had entered voluntary administration.\n\n\"At this stage, we are unable to share further information but are in contact with Air Vanuatu and the Vanuatu Government and will share updates as they become available.\n\n\"We are conscious of the impact this situation has on travellers, ticket holders and the industry and on behalf of the Vanuatu tourism industry extend our apologies to anyone affected. Virgin Australia continues to fly to Vanuatu directly between Brisbane-Port Vila.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the airline's board of directors failed in a court appeal over unresolved financial obligations. The airline had been embroiled in a long-running court case with the owners of its aircraft since 2009 over leasing terms.\n\nIn February this year, the company was ordered to pay aircraft leasing company Isleno damages in the order of VT$150 million ($2m).\n\nLast year, international services were plagued by unreliability on the airline's sole 737-800, the eight-year-old aircraft numbered YJ-AV8.\n\nThe airline has been contacted by the Herald for comment.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_bywater@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name": "Thomas Bywater", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Vanuatu", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air Vanuatu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insolvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Zealand_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New Zealand Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espiritu_Santo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espiritu Santo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Espiritu Santo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu_Daily_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu Daily Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turboprop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Administration (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_Next_Generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 Next Generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_lease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft lease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Vila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Vila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Vila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/hxjdkbhr/air-vanuatus-sole-737-800.jpg?rmode=crop&rnd=133597612363230000&height=395&width=635&quality=95&scale=both", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551916", "eventUri": "eng-9551916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2085, "textEnd": 2090}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 2676, "textEnd": 2682}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Brisbane flights, amid reports the pacific nation's government is considering placing the airline into administration.\n\nThe airline on Wednesday cancelled about 20 scheduled flights to and from Sydney, Brisbane and Auckland for the rest of the week, citing the cancellations were a result of \"extended maintenance requirements\" on their aircraft.\n\nThe pacific nation flag carrier is teetering on the edge of financial ruin after reports the Vanuatu government appointed consultancy firm EY to advise the government.\n\n\"The Vanuatu Government is now considering placing Air Vanuatu ... into voluntary administration,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nThe airline operates four planes, including one Boeing 737 and three turboprop planes.\n\nThe Vanuatu Tourism Office said it was aware of reports that \"our national carrier Air Vanuatu has entered voluntary administration\".\n\n\"We are conscious of the impact this situation has on travellers, ticket holders and the industry and on behalf of the Vanuatu tourism industry extend our apologies to anyone affected,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an evolving situation and we will continue to post updates.\"\n\nAustralia's national carrier Qantas does not operate flights into Vanuatu but has a codeshare agreement with the airline to link passengers to the nation.\n\nQantas said it was supporting customers impacted by the cancellations to find alternative flights.\n\nIt also encouraged any customers with bookings on Air Vanuatu between now until the end of May to contact their flight provider for refunds.\n\nVirgin Australia is the only other Australian airline to operate into Vanuatu with its scheduled flights continuing to go ahead.\n\nAustralia's Smartraveller website published an update stating the airline and its codeshare partners have cancelled or rescheduled flights for the coming days, urging those affected to contact the airline, their travel agent or insurance company.\n\nSydney and Brisbane airports urged passengers on Air Vanuatu flights to not travel to the airport amid the cancellations.\n\nThe airline struggles come after new Australian budget start-up Bonza collapsed with the airline just entering operations over a year ago.\n\nBonza's fleet of planes has begun to be removed from Australia before the airline's financial crisis is laid bare at a creditors' meeting.\n\nGet the latest news from

It's not what you want when you're on holiday.\"\n\nThere are currently 33 New Zealanders registered on SafeTravel as being in Vanuatu, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).\n\n\"The ministry has not been approached for assistance from any New Zealanders in Vanuatu.\"\n\nVanuatu's government today confirmed it's considering placing Air Vanuatu into voluntary administration.\n\nRepresentatives from Ernst & Young have arrived in the capital, Port Vila, after the international accounting firm was appointed to assist in \"reviewing available options and put forward recommendations to the Vanuatu Government\", an Air Vanuatu spokesperson told 1News.\n\nThe airline confirmed all international flights from Thursday, May 9 through to Sunday, May 12 have been cancelled. All future flights are under review.\n\nBoard of Airline Representatives New Zealand (BARNZ) executive director Cath O'Brien said it's \"always a sad thing to hear of an airline going through these challenges\".\n\n\"It's hard to say where things will go from here. Aviation, you know - it's a complex and expensive business with high costs.\"\n\nPacific routes, she said, are notoriously difficult to operate in.\n\n\"You haven't got a lot of traffic to serve, but it's a really important connectivity.\"\n\nTravellers who spoke to 1News said they're unsure how they'll pay for the extra nights overseas following talks with their insurers.\n\n\"They advised us that if the company has gone into liquidation, there's a potential that we may not be covered,\" Gavin said.\n\nThe uncertainty around the flights has led Oceania Football to move some of its upcoming matches from Port Vila to Fiji.\n\nAir New Zealand general manager domestic Jeremy O'Brien told 1News the airline \"has a small number of customers who will be impacted by Air Vanuatu's cancellations\".\n\nHe said while the airline \"would like to be in a position to provide a service to Vanuatu\", ongoing issues with its supply chain and engine maintenance means they \"currently don't have enough aircraft to do so\".\n\nMeanwhile, a Qantas spokesperson said it's currently \"supporting codeshare customers who have been impacted by Air Vanuatu cancellations\".\n\n\"We're encouraging any Qantas customer who holds a booking on an Air Vanuatu flight between now and 31 May to call us or their travel agent to discuss options including refunds or a flight credit.\n\n\"We will work to book any of these customers who are mid-journey onto alternative flights.\"", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

6:37AMCommentsCommentsEmail David Johns\n\nAir Vanuatu has officially been placed into voluntary liquidation following a \"challenging period\" for the global aviation industry.\n\nEY Australia has taken control of the airline, which on Thursday cancelled three days' worth of flights to and from the Pacific island nation, as voluntary liquidators.\n\nA statement released on Friday blamed the move on \"labour shortages, inflation affecting input costs and a global increasing cost of credit environment\".\n\n\"Air Vanuatu has (also) been particularly affected by disruption of tourism activity due to cyclones.\"\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nLiquidators Morgan Kelly, Justin Walsh and Andrew Hanson's first steps will be to conduct safety and maintenance checks \"before the resumption of normal operations\".\n\n\"The liquidators intend to resume normal trading as soon as possible, while considering all opportunities to place the carrier on a stronger footing,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Affected travellers will be informed of this disruption and rebooked on flights as soon as operations resume.\"\n\nMr Kelly said Air Vanuatu was \"critical and strategically important\" to the Republic of Vanuatu.\n\n\"The outlook for the airline is positive, despite pressures on the broader industry, and we will be focused on securing the future of this strategically vital national carrier,\" he said.\n\nThe airline operates four planes, including one Boeing 737 and three turboprop planes.\n\nThe first meeting of creditors is set to be announced shortly.\n\nAustralia's national carrier Qantas does not operate flights into Vanuatu but has a codeshare agreement with the airline to link passengers to the nation.\n\nQantas said it was supporting customers impacted by the cancellations to find alternative flights.\n\nIt also encouraged any customers with bookings on Air Vanuatu between now and the end of May to contact their flight provider for refunds.\n\nVirgin Australia is the only other Australian airline to fly into Vanuatu with its scheduled flights continuing to go ahead.\n\nAustralia's Smartraveller website published an update stating the airline and its codeshare partners had cancelled or rescheduled flights for the coming days, urging those affected to contact the airline, their travel agent or insurance company.\n\nSydney and Brisbane airports urged passengers on Air Vanuatu flights not to travel to the airport amid the cancellations.\n\nThe airline's struggles come after new Australian budget start-up Bonza collapsed with the airline just entering operations over a year ago.\n\nBonza's fleet of planes has begun to be removed from Australia before the airline's financial crisis is laid bare at a creditors' meeting.\n\nCustomers can stay up to date on the latest flight cancellations and changes via Air Vanuatu's website here.\n\n-- With AAP\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West

one-third of the nation's economy.\n\n\"The Vanuatu Government is now considering placing Air Vanuatu, the national carrier of Vanuatu, into voluntary administration,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nAccountants from Ernst & Young had landed in the capital Port Vila earlier in the day to review options along with the airline and government officials, it said.\n\nThe carrier said it had cancelled or placed under review all future international flights servicing Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and Solomon Islands.\n\nThe airline said it had been operating in a \"challenging environment\".\n\nTwo of its aircraft, a Boeing 737 and an Airbus A320, are grounded and require engineering work at a time of limited international supply of spare parts,

the Republic of Vanuatu.\n\n\"The outlook for the airline is positive, despite pressures on the broader industry, and we will be focused on securing the future of this strategically vital national carrier,\" he said.\n\nThe airline operates four planes, including one Boeing 737 and three turboprop planes.\n\nThe first meeting of creditors is set to be announced shortly.\n\nAustralia's national

This sudden decision has implications not only for travelers but also for the broader tourism sectors in these regions.\n\nPassengers who were scheduled to fly with Air Vanuatu to or from the affected cities this week have been caught off-guard by the cancellations. Brisbane Airport has already issued advisories urging passengers not to travel to the airport following the cancellation announcements for Thursday and Friday flights. The disruption is considerable, as it affects plans, reservations, and the overall travel experience, pushing passengers to seek last-minute alternatives or cancellations.\n\nThe grounding of flights follows troubling financial disclosures about Air Vanuatu. The Vanuatu Daily Post reports the dissolution of the airline's board and the appointment of an administrator on May 6, signaling severe financial distress. This development comes after a former infrastructure and public utilities minister flagged the airline's dire financial situation last month, describing it as on the brink of bankruptcy. These financial woes reflect deeper issues within the airline, complicating its operational capacity and future.\n\nAir Vanuatu's official communication attributes the flight cancellations to \"extended maintenance requirements\" on their aircraft. The airline's website lists these changes under a section dedicated to flight schedule adjustments, assuring passengers that efforts are being made in collaboration with partner carriers to minimize guest disruption. Meanwhile, public service announcements from Brisbane Airport further confirm the situation's urgency, advising passengers to stay informed through Air Vanuatu's customer support and to await further updates.\n\nThe cancellation of flights by a national carrier like Air Vanuatu has broader ramifications for tourism in Vanuatu and the affected destinations in Australia and New Zealand. The Vanuatu Tourism Office has acknowledged the gravity of the situation, expressing regret over the inconvenience to travelers and the potential fallout for the local tourism industry. As a key player in promoting travel to and from Vanuatu, the national airline's operational stability is crucial for the confidence and reliability perceived by international tourists and business travelers alike.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, both the tourism industry and the government of Vanuatu are closely monitoring developments. Their active engagement is critical in managing the fallout, providing support to affected parties, and devising strategies to ensure the continuity of travel operations and safeguard the nation's tourism reputation.\n\nAir Vanuatu's flight cancellations are a poignant reminder of the vulnerabilities in the aviation and travel sectors. As this situation develops, the focus will be on mitigating the immediate impact on travelers and addressing the underlying financial and operational challenges that have led to this disruption. The industry's response will play a vital role in shaping the future trajectory of travel norms and consumer confidence in the region.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Vanuatu", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air Vanuatu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu_Daily_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu Daily Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Al", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "El Al"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/A220-100-Air-Vanuatu-01-1024x76-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551916", "eventUri": "eng-9551916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1043, "textEnd": 1048}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The arrival of this shipment marks a significant milestone in Vanuatu's Paralympic journey, providing invaluable resources to nurture and empower their athletes. As these goods are unloaded onto the shores of Vanuatu, they represent not only tangible support but also a beacon of hope for Paralympians striving to achieve their dreams amidst unique challenges.\n\n\"P&O Cruises Australia loves to give back to the destinations we visit, and Vanuatu is a favourite destination for our guests.

After a brief voyage, the vessel arrived at its destination on the 7th of May, delivering much-needed aid to the awaiting recipients.\n\nIn addition to this charitable endeavor, P&O Cruises Australia extends its support to the Vanuatu Women's Beach Volleyball team through the Pacific Partnerships program, funded by our guests.

Our team is working closely with management to ensure continuity of service to customers and to ensure services continue as seamlessly as possible.\"\n\nEY said the troubled airline faced not only the same pressure as the rest of the industry such as labour shortages and inflation, but has been particularly affected by disruption of tourism activity due to cyclones.\n\nAir Vanuatu has flagged the possibility of selling off of assets to pay down its debts.\n\nReports in the Vanuatu Daily Post earlier this week claimed the airline was \"facing bankruptcy\", while the government of the Pacific nation has previously raised the prospect of privatising the carrier.\n\nAir Vanuatu yesterday confirmed the cancellation of all international flights from Thursday 9 May 2024 through to Sunday 12 May 2024 inclusive, while \"all future flights after Sunday 12 May 2024 are currently under review.\"\n\nAir Vanuatu said it would continually update its Vanuatu Travel Advisory page with information for passengers.\n\nAir Vanuatu's network saw flights to to Sydney, Brisbane, Auckland, Noumea and Fiji from its hub at Port Villa; Virgin Australia also has direct flights between Brisbane and Port Villa.\n\nUp to four hours flight from Australia's east coast, the hidden beaches and pristine 'blue pools' of the lush Vanuatu archipelago have long been among its many drawcards.\n\n\"We are conscious of the impact this situation has on travellers, ticket holders and the industry and on behalf of the Vanuatu tourism industry extend our apologies to anyone affected,\" noted the Vanuatu Tourism Office in a statement.\n\n\"This is an evolving situation and we will continue to post updates to www.vanuatu.travel.\"", "source": {"uri": "executivetraveller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Executive Traveller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Vanuatu", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air Vanuatu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HSBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_&_Young", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ernst & Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Vila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port Vila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Vila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu_Daily_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanuatu Daily Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgin Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archipelago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noum\u00e9a", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Noum\u00e9a"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Caledonia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.executivetraveller.com/photos/view/size:1200,675/663c2191a4bc4cc09409644cdd799465-air-vanuatu-administration-flights-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551916", "eventUri": "eng-9551916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 452993389, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 46, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 46}}}

The other train then crashed into it.\n\nAssociated Press video footage from the scene showed mangled train coaches on the tracks as hundreds of onlookers and victims' relatives gathered around on both sides of the tracks.\n\nThe dead and injured were initially placed on blankets by the sides of the tracks running through farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria.\n\nAmbulances were standing by and riot police were deployed to keep the onlookers away from the scene of the disaster.\n\nAssistant health minister Sharif Wadi told state television that most of the injured had been taken to hospital.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah El-Sisi sent his condolences to the victims' families and ordered a probe to \"hold accountable\" those responsible for the disaster, his office said.\n\nEgypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.\n\nFriday's collision was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year, the highest number since 2009 when the number reached 1,577.\n\nFriday's accident was the deadliest rail accident since 2006, when at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nThat accident had jolted the government which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority.\n\nThe accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Months later a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people.\n\nAlmost a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of Cairo.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train plowed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nThere have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwest Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into bus, truck and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train.\n\nIn August 2006, at least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 injured in a collision between two trains traveling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, an Egyptian court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect.\n\nThe deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died as a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 3107, "textStart": 3098}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 3324, "textStart": 3313}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T13:41:00Z", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "title": "Arab News", "id": "4355"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:10:00", "url": "http://www.arabnews.com/node/1143111/middle-east", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8676710", "image": "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2017/08/11/968631-466475016.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "13:41:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

The ministry said 75 ambulances had been deployed at the crash scene to treat casualties and that all the hospitals in Alexandria had been placed on high alert.\n\nTrain accidents are common in Egypt. In 2016, a train derailed in south of Cairo, killing five people, and injuring 27 people in the al-Ayat area. Another train derailment in Badr Rashin in Giza killed at least 19 people in 2013.\n\nIn 2012, a collision between a train and school bus on a rail crossing in the town of Manaflut in Upper Egypt killed 51 people, mostly children. At least 360 people were killed in 2002 in Egypt's worst train disaster when a major fire engulfed seven carriages of an overcrowded passenger train.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Egypt Train Collision", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 43, "textStart": 28}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 176, "textStart": 163}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:07:00Z", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:07:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/world/egypt-train-collision-kills-44-injures-nearly-180-4792996/", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8736268", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/egy-759.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

trains.\n\nThe deadly collision took place yesterday after a train travelling to Alexandria from Cairo, crashed into the back of another train coming from the Canal city of Port Said, which was waiting at a small station in the district of Khorshid, east of Alexandria, the Egyptian Railways Authority said in a statement.\n\nThe area of the collision has been cordoned off by security forces as a rescue team is currently searching for survivors over the night and removing the wreckage off the tracks, it said.\n\nIman Hamdy, 26, a survivor of the accident, said that she was travelling in the train going to Alexandria and noticed that it was already in a bad condition.\n\nThe Al-Masri el-Youm Arabic newspaper quoted her saying that the train abruptly stopped for 15 minutes in Ebies area near Khorshid station when she felt its collision with the another train.\n\nHamdy, who succeeded in escaping from the train through one of the windows, said that she will never forget the large number of injured, mostly women and children, she saw at the accident site.\n\nAnother survivor, 10 year-old Karim Abdel Wahab, said that he couldn't find his mother and brother who were travelling with him in the train.\n\nThe driver of the Cairo-Alexandria train has surrendered himself to police and has been transferred to El-Raml police station in Alexandria for investigation, local media said quoting a health ministry official.\n\nEgypt's prosecutor-general Nabil Sadiq has ordered an urgent investigation into the collision to find out the reason behind the crash.\n\nPresident El-Sisi

Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.\n\nEgypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.\n\nFriday's crash was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year, the highest number since 2009 when the number reached 1,577.\n\nFriday's accident was the deadliest rail accident since 2006, when at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nAnd earlier, in 2002, a massive fire engulfed a train filled with local holiday travelers. The train sped for miles, with flames engulfing one carriage after another, killing more than 370 people.\n\nIn November 2012, a speeding train crashed into a bus carrying Egyptian children to their kindergarten in the country's south, killing more than 50 -- mostly children between the ages of four and six.

Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.\n\nEgypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.\n\nFriday's crash was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year, the highest number since 2009 when the number reached 1,577.\n\nFriday's accident was the deadliest rail accident since 2006, when at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nIn November 2012, a speeding train crashed into a bus carrying Egyptian children to their kindergarten in the country's south, killing more than 50, mostly children between the ages of four and six.

Footage on the state broadcaster showed one train had partly keeled over in the crash, and medics were seen moving the dead and injured to ambulances.\n\nTransport Ministry officials, quoted on state television, said the crash was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt on the rails. The other train then crashed into it.\n\nOne of them had been heading from Cairo to the northern city of Alexandria and the other from the canal city of Port Said, east of the capital, to Alexandria. The dead and injured were initially placed on blankets by the sides of the tracks amid farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria.\n\nAssistant Health Minister Sharif Wadi told state television that most of the injured had been taken to hospital. Egypt's transport minister has ordered an investigation into the crash, pledging to \"hold accountable\" whoever was responsible, state television reported.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a train plowed into a bus carrying schoolchildren in November 2012, killing 47 people. That accident had jolted the government, which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority. The accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Months later a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people. Almost a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of Cairo. They had been returning from a wedding when the train plowed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines. There have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwest Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into bus, truck and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train. In August 2006, at least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 wounded in a collision between two trains traveling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, an Egyptian court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect. The deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died as a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital. -- AFP", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1324, "textStart": 1311}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 2141, "textStart": 2132}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 2357, "textStart": 2346}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:12:00Z", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "title": "Saudi Gazette", "id": "5204"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:12:00", "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/514910/World/Mena/Egypt", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8736784", "image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2017/08/11/461124.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Residents from nearby homes rushed to the scene to look for survivors inside crushed train carriages or offer first aid to the injured.\n\nAn eyewitness who lives close to the crash site said he and others ran toward the site when they heard the sound of the impact.\n\n\"We ran to the scene and we found people jumping from the train and lots of dead,\" said Abdel-Bari Abdel-Hamid.\n\nBy nightfall, cranes aided by floodlights began to remove the wreckage off the tracks to allow rail traffic to resume. Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.\n\nEgypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.\n\nFriday's crash was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year, the highest number since 2009 when the number reached 1,577.\n\nFriday's accident was the deadliest rail accident since 2006, when at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nAnd earlier, in 2002, a massive fire engulfed a train filled with local holiday travelers. The train sped for miles, with flames engulfing one carriage after another, killing more than 370 people.\n\nIn November 2012, a speeding train crashed into a bus carrying Egyptian children to their kindergarten in the country's south, killing more than 50 -- mostly children between the ages of four and six. Two months later, at least 19 people died and more than 100 were injured in a train derailment south of Cairo.\n\nZaki reported from Cairo.\n\nNever miss another Facebook post from WISH-TV", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 2552, "textStart": 2539}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T21:32:00Z", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "title": "WISH-TV", "id": "3130"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:32:00", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2017/08/11/train-collision-in-egypt-kills-43-122-injured/", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8705064", "image": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/egypt-train-collision.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "21:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria August 11, 2017. -- Reuters picALEXANDRIA, Aug 12 -- The death toll from Egypt's latest train disaster rose to 40 as cranes worked today to clear the stricken railway line between Cairo and the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.\n\nUnder floodlights, rescue teams combed wrecked carriages all night for casualties, also using torches on their mobile phones.\n\nThe toll from yesterday's accident when two trains hurtled into each other near Alexandria has risen to 40 dead and 123 wounded, said health ministry spokesman Khaled Moujahed, as local media said the number of fatalities was likely to rise.\n\nA stream of ambulances ferried the injured, stretched out on the ground in a field alongside the railway tracks, to Alexandria hospitals.\n\nWorkers used cranes to lift four knotted sheet-metal carriages blocking the normally busy Cairo-Alexandria line.\n\nTransport ministry officials, quoted on state television, have said the crash in farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt.\n\nThe other train then crashed into it.\n\nOne train had been heading to Alexandria from Cairo and the other from Port Said, east along the coast.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has sent his condolences to the victims' families and ordered a probe to \"hold accountable\" those responsible for the disaster.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a train ploughed into a bus carrying schoolchildren in November 2012, killing 47 people.\n\nThat accident jolted the government which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority.\n\nThe accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Just months later, a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people.\n\nAround a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of the capital.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train ploughed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nThere have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwestern Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into a bus, a lorry and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train.\n\nAt least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 injured in August 2006 in a collision between two trains travelling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, a court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect.\n\nThe deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died when a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital. -- AFP", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 135, "textStart": 120}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 169, "textStart": 163}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1614, "textStart": 1601}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 2445, "textStart": 2436}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 2719, "textStart": 2708}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T10:29:00Z", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "source": {"uri": "themalaymailonline.com", "title": "themalaymailonline.com", "id": "661"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:29:00", "url": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/egypt-train-crash-toll-hits-40-as-cranes-clear-busy-link", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8777819", "image": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-08/reuters_egypt_train_collision_20170812.JPG", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "10:29:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Residents from nearby homes rushed to the scene to look for survivors inside crushed train carriages or offer first aid to the injured.\n\nAn eyewitness who lives close to the crash site said he and others ran toward the site when they heard the sound of the impact.\n\n\"We ran to the scene and we found people jumping from the train and lots of dead,\" said Abdel-Bari Abdel-Hamid.\n\nBy nightfall, cranes aided by floodlights began to remove the wreckage off the tracks to allow rail traffic to resume. Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages.\n\nEgypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.\n\nFriday's crash was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year, the highest number since 2009 when the number reached 1,577.\n\nFriday's accident was the deadliest rail accident since 2006, when at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nAnd earlier, in 2002, a massive fire engulfed a train filled with local holiday travellers. The train sped for miles, with flames engulfing one carriage after another, killing more than 370 people.\n\nIn November 2012, a speeding train crashed into a bus carrying Egyptian children to their kindergarten in the country's south, killing more than 50 - mostly children between the ages of four and six. Two months later, at least 19 people died and more than 100 were injured in a train derailment south of Cairo.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 73, "textStart": 58}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 2623, "textStart": 2610}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T20:53:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "lethbridgeherald.com", "title": "lethbridgeherald.com", "id": "6076"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:53:00", "url": "http://lethbridgeherald.com/news/world-news/2017/08/11/train-collision-in-northern-egypt-kills-43-122-injured/", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8699417", "image": "http://lethbridgeherald.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/CAIBS101-811_2017_183619.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "20:53:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

disaster rose to 40 as cranes worked Saturday to clear the stricken railway line between Cairo and the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.\n\nUnder floodlights, rescue teams combed wrecked carriages all night for casualties, also using torches on their mobile phones.\n\nThe toll from Friday's accident when two trains hurtled into each other near Alexandria has risen to 40 dead and 123 wounded, said health ministry spokesman Khaled Moujahed, as local media said the number of fatalities was likely to rise.\n\nThe crash on the route to Cairo, derailed the engine of one train and two cars of the other, the Egyptian Railway Authority said.\n\nA railroad switching error was the most likely cause of the collision, according to a security source.\n\nWorkers used cranes to lift four knotted sheet-metal carriages blocking the normally busy Cairo-Alexandria line.\n\nTransport ministry officials, quoted on state television, have said the crash in farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt.\n\nThe other train then crashed into it.\n\nOne train had been heading to Alexandria from Cairo and the other from Port Said, east along the coast.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has sent his condolences to the victims' families and ordered a probe to \"hold accountable\" those responsible for the disaster.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a train ploughed into a bus carrying schoolchildren in November 2012, killing 47 people.\n\nThat accident jolted the government which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority.\n\nThe accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Just months later, a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people.\n\nAround a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of the capital.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train ploughed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nThere have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwestern Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into a bus, a lorry and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train.\n\nAt least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 injured in August 2006 in a collision between two trains travelling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, a court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect.\n\nThe deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died when a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1537, "textStart": 1524}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 2368, "textStart": 2359}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 2642, "textStart": 2631}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T11:14:00Z", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "source": {"uri": "sbs.com.au", "title": "Special Broadcasting Service Corporation (SBS)", "id": "793"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:32:00", "url": "http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/08/12/inquiry-deadly-egypt-train-crash-death-toll-rises-40", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8791002", "image": "http://www.sbs.com.au/news/sites/sbs.com.au.news/files/styles/full/public/20170812001314203086-original.jpg?itok=A9Zt4sGP", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "11:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

deadliest in a string of such accidents in Egypt, the health ministry said.\n\nThe crash also injured 123 people, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nFootage on the state broadcaster showed one train had partly keeled over in the crash, and medics were seen moving the dead and injured to ambulances.\n\nTransport ministry officials, quoted on state television, said the crash was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt on the rails.\n\nThe other train then crashed into it.\n\nOne train had been heading from Cairo to the northern city of Alexandria and the other from the canal city of Port Said, east of the capital, to Alexandria.\n\nThe dead and injured were initially placed on blankets in a field beside the tracks running through farmland on the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe health ministry said 75 ambulances had been dispatched to treat casualties and that all the hospitals in Alexandria had been placed on high alert.\n\nAssistant health minister Sharif Wadi told state television that most of the injured had been transferred to hospital.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sent his condolences to the victims' families and ordered a probe to \"hold accountable\" those responsible for the disaster, his office said.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a train ploughed into a bus carrying schoolchildren in November 2012, killing 47 people.\n\nThat accident had jolted the government which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority.\n\nThe accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nSTRINGS OF ACCIDENTS\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Just months later, a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people.\n\nAround a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of the capital.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train ploughed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nThere have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwest Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into bus, truck and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train.\n\nIn August 2006, at least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 injured in a collision between two trains travelling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, a court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect.\n\nThe deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died when a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 83, "textStart": 77}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1529, "textStart": 1516}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 2386, "textStart": 2377}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 2603, "textStart": 2592}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:50:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "title": "Channel NewsAsia", "id": "1555"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:50:00", "url": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/egypt-train-collision-kills-at-least-37-ministry-9116438", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8691046", "image": "http://www.channelnewsasia.com/image/9116776/16x9/991/529/d656fa7263aff09ee016a1c1a6e78dce/qC/egypt-train-crash.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

It is considered the worst disaster to hit the country's railway system in the past 25 years.The transportation minister at the time was forced to resign as a result.\n\nAugust 2006: At least 58 people were killed and 143 injured when two passenger trains heading to Cairo from the Nile Delta towns of Mansoura and Benha collided.\n\nOctober 2009: Two trains collided in the el-Ayat area, leaving 30 killed and many others injured. The first train had broken down and was rear-ended by the second. Transport Minister Mohammed Lutfi Mansour resigned three days after the accident.\n\nNovember 2012: A school bus was hit by a train in central Egypt, and 50 children, aged four to six years old, and the driver of the bus were killed. This accident happened near Manfalut, 350km (230 miles) south of Cairo. The transport minister resigned in the wake of the accident.\n\nJanuary 2013: A military train derailed, killing 19 and injuring more than 100. The train, which was heading to Cairo from Assuit and carried new recruits of the Egyptian Central Security Forces, derailed in the Egyptian city of Badrashin.\n\nAccording to the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) in 2016, Egypt has witnessed an average of 1,041 train accidents on an annual basis in the last 12 years.\n\nA total of 13,539 train accidents occurred between 2004 and 2016, reports CAPMAS, citing numbers released by the National Railway Authority of Egypt.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 21, "textStart": 7}, {"amb": false, "date": "1998-10-", "textEnd": 898, "textStart": 886}, {"amb": false, "date": "1999-11-", "textEnd": 1004, "textStart": 991}, {"amb": false, "date": "2002-02-", "textEnd": 1270, "textStart": 1257}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 1594, "textStart": 1583}, {"amb": false, "date": "2009-10-", "textEnd": 1757, "textStart": 1745}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 2005, "textStart": 1992}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-01-", "textEnd": 2287, "textStart": 2275}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T12:45:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "egypttoday.com", "title": "Egypt Today", "id": "18008"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:45:00", "url": "http://www.egypttoday.com/Article/1/16898/Egypt-s-train-accidents-when-will-we-stop-counting?fbrefresh=true", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8792663", "image": "http://www.egypttoday.com/images/larg/16751.jpg?fbrefresh=true", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "12:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

clear the stricken railway line between Cairo and the Mediterranean city of Alexandria.\n\nUnder floodlights, rescue teams combed wrecked carriages all night for casualties, also using torches on their mobile phones.\n\nThe toll from Friday's accident when two trains hurtled into each other near Alexandria has risen to 40 dead and 123 wounded, said health ministry spokesman Khaled Moujahed, as local media said the number of fatalities was likely to rise.\n\nA stream of ambulances ferried the injured, stretched out on the ground in a field alongside the railway tracks, to Alexandria hospitals.\n\nWorkers used cranes to lift four knotted sheet-metal carriages blocking the normally busy Cairo-Alexandria line.\n\nTransport ministry officials, quoted on state television, have said the crash in farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt.\n\nThe other train then crashed into it.\n\nOne train had been heading to Alexandria from Cairo and the other from Port Said, east along the coast.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has sent his condolences to the victims' families and ordered a probe to \"hold accountable\" those responsible for the disaster.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a train ploughed into a bus carrying schoolchildren in November 2012, killing 47 people.\n\nThat accident jolted the government which ordered an investigation and sacked the transport minister and the head of the railway authority.\n\nThe accident was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe probe, however, did not prevent further accidents. Just months later, a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people.\n\nAround a year later, a collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of the capital.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train ploughed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nThere have been many other fatal crashes on the busy rail network.\n\nIn July 2008, at least 44 people died near Marsa Matruh in northwestern Egypt when a runaway truck hurtled into a bus, a lorry and several cars waiting at a level crossing, shunting the vehicles into the path of a train.\n\nAt least 58 Egyptians were killed and 144 injured in August 2006 in a collision between two trains travelling on the same track.\n\nIn the wake of that crash, a court sentenced 14 railway employees to one year in prison for neglect.\n\nThe deadliest accident on Egypt's railways dates back to 2002 when 373 people died when a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1441, "textStart": 1428}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textEnd": 2272, "textStart": 2263}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-08-", "textEnd": 2546, "textStart": 2535}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3354959", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T09:44:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "title": "digitaljournal.com", "id": "556"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:44:00", "url": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/egypt-train-crash-toll-hits-40-as-cranes-clear-busy-link/article/499821", "storyUri": "eng-3354959", "id": "8772710", "image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/5/2/p-large/3ee2f13f4ae5faaa58b3c8bdeeac9207f2486ad8.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "09:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Magdy Hegazy, a top health official in Alexandria, said that along with the 43 killed, the crash also injured 122 people, the AP reports. The Egyptian Railways Authority said earlier that a train coming from Cairo, Egypt's capital, crashed into the back of a train that was waiting at a small station in the district of Khorshid, just east of Alexandria. The stationary train had just arrived from Port Said, a Mediterranean city on the northern tip of the Suez Canal, when it was hit, according to the statement. The statement did not say what caused the accident, only that the authority's experts would investigate.\n\nAP footage from the scene showed mangled train coaches on the tracks and several others derailed as hundreds of onlookers and victims' relatives gathered around on both sides of the tracks. Ambulances were standing by and riot police and soldiers were deployed to keep the onlookers away from the scene of the disaster. Residents from nearby homes rushed to the scene to look for survivors inside crushed train carriages or offer first aid to the injured. By nightfall, cranes aided by floodlights began to remove the wreckage off the tracks to allow rail traffic to resume. Rescue teams, meanwhile, continued to look for more bodies and injured passengers inside the carriages. Egypt's railway system has a poor safety record, mostly blamed on decades of badly maintained equipment and poor management.

Currently, reports from Egypt's Health Ministry have counted at least 40 fatalities. Rescuers have also counted at least 133 injured in the wreckage. Investigators are thoroughly combing through the scene looking for clues as to what may have caused this deadly incident. Egypt has a history of train crashes, but this is the deadliest one in many years.\n\nReports from the state news agency Al-Ahram said that two trains collided at a station in the district of Khorshid near the seaside city of Alexandria.\n\nOne train was coming in from Cairo, and the other was heading in from Port Said. The fatal accident occurred when the Cairo train rammed into the back of the train from Port Said, which was stationary.\n\nTransport ministry officials are now speculating that the incident was caused by a malfunction in the Port Said train, causing it to come to a halt. The results were catastrophic, leaving at least 40 people dead and 133 injured. Over 75 emergency vehicles showed up to the scene of the incident to transport the wounded to local hospitals.\n\nSurvivors immediately took to social media to share images of the crash. Many described the incident as being shocking.\n\nMoumen Youssef reported to Reuters that the train was traveling at fast speeds when he was suddenly thrust onto the floor.\n\n\"When we came out, we found four train cars crushed and a lot of people on the ground,\" Youssef said.\n\nWitnesses said that civilians rushed to the scene to help the injured passengers. Many brought tools such as welding equipment to help free people who may have been stuck under the wreckage.\n\nWater and sugar were provided by local women, and several men used their trucks to help clear out some of the debris.\n\nThis fatal incident has reignited national anger over the country's poor #Public Transportation System.\n\nThe deadliest public transportation incident to ever occur in Egypt happened in 2002. A fire erupted in an overcrowded train, killing 373 people.\n\nIn 2012, at least 47 children were killed or seriously injured when a train hit their school bus.\n\nIn 2013, a train derailed, leaving 17 people dead. This train was carrying military conscripts.\n\nLater in 2013, a train collided with another bus near Cairo. This incident left 27 people dead. The bus passengers were returning to the city from a wedding when the train slammed into them.\n\nIn response to today's accident, President Sisi has promised financial compensation to the families of the victims. He has also stated that a full investigation will be underway.

television, citing transport ministry officials, reported that the crash was probably caused by a malfunction in one of the trains that brought it to a halt on the rails.\n\nThe other train then crashed into it.\n\nThe dead and injured were initially placed on blankets by the sides of the tracks amid farmland on the outskirts of the Mediterranean city.\n\nWadi told state television that most of the injured have been taken to hospital.\n\nEgypt's transport minister has ordered an investigation into the crash, pledging to \"hold accountable\" whoever was responsible, state television reported.\n\nIt was the deadliest train accident in the North African country since a November 2013 collision between a train and a bus killed 27 people south of Cairo.\n\nThey had been returning from a wedding when the train ploughed into their bus and a truck at a railway crossing.\n\nThat accident came months after a train carrying military conscripts derailed, killing 17 people, and almost a year after 47 schoolchildren were killed when a train crashed into their bus.\n\nBoth the transport minister and the head of the railway authority head were forced to resign as a result of that accident, which was blamed on a train signal operator who fell asleep on the job.\n\nThe government also formed a panel to investigate the incident, but that did not prevent further accidents.\n\nEgyptians have long complained that the government has failed to deal with chronic transport problems, with roads as poorly maintained as railway lines.\n\nIn Egypt's deadliest train accident, in 2002, 373 people died when a fire ripped through a crowded train south of the capital.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-11-", "textEnd": 943, "textStart": 930}],

The drivers of the two trains that collided on Friday have been held for questioning and four railway officials suspended pending the results of a probe into its causes, Transportation Minister Hisham Arafat told an Egyptian broadcaster. Under floodlights, rescue teams had combed wrecked carriages all night for casualties. In Kuwait, His Highness the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah on Friday cabled Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi expressing condolences on death and injury of scores of people in the two trains' accident in Alexandria. His Highness the Amir, in the cable, prayed for souls of the deceased and wished the injured speedy recovery. Their Highnesses the Crown Prince and Prime Minister, respectively Sheikh Nawaf Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah, addressed cables of identical content to the Egyptian president.\n\nKuwait's National Assembly Speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanim on Friday sent a cable of condolences to his Egyptian counterpart Ali Abdel-Aal over the victims of the two-train collision in Alexandria. In the cable, Al-Ghanim prayed to Allah the Almighty to bless the souls of victims of the crash and to bring solace to their families, and wished a speedy recovery to the wounded.\n\nTransport ministry officials, quoted on state television, have said the crash in farmland on the outskirts of Alexandria was probably caused by a malfunction in one train that brought it to a halt. The other train then crashed into it. Arafat had told reporters at the scene of the accident that it was not yet clear why the train had stopped, but suggested old traffic signals were to blame. \"We have a big problem we had already announced, which is old traffic signals. We are completely overhauling them. This section here is being developed,\" he said.\n\nAn injured passenger who was on the stationary train said its departure had been delayed and that it kept stopping en route. \"It stopped every now and then between stations or before stations for five minutes, I don't know why,\" the man told Dream television station from his hospital bed. \"Everyone was scattered (by the collision), bodies were flung around,\" he said. The toll from Friday's accident when the two trains collided near Alexandria rose to 41 dead, the health ministry said on Saturday.\n\nThe accident also wounded 132 people, with 79 being discharged after treatment while 53 remained in hospital on Saturday, Health Minister Ahmed Emad el-Din Rady said. A stream of ambulances had ferried the injured, stretched out on the ground in a field alongside the railway tracks, to Alexandria hospitals. Workers used cranes to lift four knotted sheet-metal carriages blocking the normally busy Cairo-Alexandria line.

"CAIRO, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has launched an on-the-spot technical railway check after a recent deadly train crash in Alexandria, which killed 49 people, the general prosecution office said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nEgypt's top prosecutor assigned a military engineering body to perform an on-the-spot technical railway check after the deadly train crash in the coastal city of Alexandria.\n\nThe top prosecutor ordered formation of a seven-member committee from the Armed Forces Engineering Authority and the consultation office of the Military Technical College to issue a report on Friday's two-train collision in seaside northern city of Alexandria that left at least 49 dead and over 130 wounded.\n\nThe committee will also include two members from the country's anti-corruption Administrative Control Authority.\n\n\"The committee's mission is to examine the crash scene and technically check the soundness of the railroad and the traffic light signals and semaphores based on the standards regulated for railway operation,\" said the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Transportation Ministry said that the two drivers of the twin trains have been held for questioning and four railway officials have been suspended over the tragedy.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Egypt has witnessed several deadly railway crashes that signaled poor railway conditions and lack of necessary railroad maintenance.\n\nThe worst train accident in Egypt took place at Giza's district of Ayyat in 2002, which killed 350 passengers when fire broke out in a train coming from Upper Egypt, forcing passengers to hopelessly jump out to survive.\n\nAnother train tragedy hit the country 10 years later, particularly in November 2012, when a train hit a school bus at a crossing barrier area in Upper Egypt's Assiut province, killing over 50 children.\n\nLater in early 2013, the derailment of a train in Giza carrying new police recruits left 19 people killed and over 100 wounded.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 14, "textStart": 7}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-11-", "textEnd": 1695, "textStart": 1682}], "isDuplicate":

killed 49 people, the general prosecution office said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nEgypt's top prosecutor assigned a military engineering body to perform an on-the-spot technical railway check after the deadly train crash in the coastal city of Alexandria.\n\nThe top prosecutor ordered formation of a seven-member committee from the Armed Forces Engineering Authority and the consultation office of the Military Technical College to issue a report on Friday's two-train collision in seaside northern city of Alexandria that left at least 49 dead and over 130 wounded.\n\nThe committee will also include two members from the country's anti-corruption Administrative Control Authority.\n\n\"The committee's mission is to examine the crash scene and technically check the soundness of the railroad and the traffic light signals and semaphores based on the standards regulated for railway operation,\" said the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Transportation Ministry said that the two drivers of the twin trains have been held for questioning and four railway officials have been suspended over the tragedy.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Egypt has witnessed several deadly railway crashes that signaled poor railway conditions and lack of necessary railroad maintenance.\n\nThe worst train accident in Egypt took place at Giza's district of Ayyat in 2002, which killed 350 passengers when fire broke out in a train coming from Upper Egypt, forcing passengers to hopelessly jump out to survive.\n\nAnother train tragedy hit the country 10 years later, particularly in November 2012, when a train hit a school bus at a crossing barrier area in Upper Egypt's Assiut province, killing over 50 children.\n\nLater in early 2013, the derailment of a train in Giza carrying new police recruits left 19 people killed and over 100 wounded.\n\nCentral delegation visits residents in Inner Mongolia\n\nIn pics: magnificent landmarks of BRICS countries\n\nLocal community organizes donation event to aid Jiuzhaigou

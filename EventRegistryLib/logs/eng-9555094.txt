Congress has used this as a weapon and is criticising the alliance of BJP and JDS. National leaders have also used the Prajwal case to attack Prime Minister Modi. Meanwhile, sources said that Prajwal is likely to return to India after the polls are over on May 7.\n\nPrajwal left the country and went into hiding on April 26, the midnight of the first phase of elections in Karnataka. Prajwal was rumored to arrive in Bangalore on May 5. SIT officers were waiting at Bangalore, Mangalore, Goa or Kochi airports. But Prajwal never came.\n\nAccording to the latest information, it is said that he is likely to come after the election, i.e. after May 7. There is also a possibility that Prajwal will surrender after the 2nd phase of polling. Meanwhile, the officials of the special investigation team have requested the CBI to issue a blue corner notice. The Women's Commission is also preparing to issue a notice to Prajwal.\n\nPrajwal had left for Germany on April 26 and had booked a return ticket there. A return ticket was booked to come back on May 15. After this, another ticket was booked to come back on May 3 after the SIT notice. SIT officers are waiting for Prajwal since 2 days. The SIT officials have set up camp at the Kempegowda airport and checked the passenger list of the flights coming to Bangalore at the immigration. They have checked the ticket of Prajwal with passport number. However, Prajwal ticket has not been booked in any flight till now.\n\nAn eye has been kept on the flights of many countries including Dubai, Muscat, Frankfurt. Inspection is being done at the airport by two teams in two shifts. Preparations have been made to arrest Prajwal from the airport itself.\n\nMeanwhile, it is said that Prajwal's family, embarrassed by the sexual assault case, has pressured MP Prajwal to attend the hearing. The video case is taking a turn day by day. They have advised not to stay abroad without attending the hearing. This is causing embarrassment to the family and the party.\n\nFirst appear before the SIT and face the inquiry. The truth emerges from the legal battle. If you go legally without attending the hearing, it will be a further problem. A lot of damage has already been done by this case.\n\nIt is said that the family has advised to immediately discuss with a lawyer and attend the trial.", "source": {"uri": "thehansindia.com",

The SIT arrested the 66-year-old former Karnataka minister on May 4 after rescuing an abducted woman, also a survivor of an alleged sexual assault by Prajwal, from the Mysuru farmhouse of Revanna's aide Sathish Babanna, who is also in SIT custody.\n\nAlso Read | 'King of blackmail': DK Shivakumar says Prajwal Revanna's uncle HD Kumaraswamy behind pen drives\n\nThe abduction case was registered following a complaint by the woman's 20-year-old son, who alleged that his mother had figured in the huge cache of explicit videos leaked recently of women who were allegedly raped and molested by Revanna's son Prajwal.\n\nRevanna's counsel CV Nagesh sought bail for his client and challenged the legality of the MLA's arrest, claiming the abduction case lacked substantial evidence.\n\n\"Nagesh argued that Revanna's arrest was unjustified, claiming there was no coercion involved in the alleged incident. He also contended that the timing of the filing of the FIR (first information report) and Revanna's subsequent arrest points at political motives,\" an official familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity.\n\nAlso Read | Prajwal Revanna 'sex videos': HD Kumaraswamy alleges '25000 pen drives' plot\n\nThe lawyer further questioned as to why despite having the custody of the woman for six days, SIT failed to record her statement, inspect the crime scene and secure the alleged vehicles used. \"He argued that the SIT failed produce any evidence before the court in the case,\" the official added.\n\nThe SIT, however, opposed the bail plea filed by the Holenarasipur MLA, who is the son of JD(S) patriarch and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\n\"The abduction of the woman was orchestrated by the accused to prevent her from testifying against Prajwal Revanna,\" the SIT's counsel Jayna Kothari submitted before the court. \"There are concerns over potential interference in the ongoing probe if bail were to be granted to the accused.\"\n\nThe special MP/MLA court adjourned the hearing in the bail plea to May 13. The MLA is currently lodged in judicial custody at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail.\n\nThe abduction case is linked to the allegations of sexual abuse of women by Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is seeking re-election from the seat as an NDA candidate. Hassan Lok Sabha seat, considered the bastion of Deve Gowda family, went to polls April 26. A day later, Prajwal reportedly left the country and has since failed to respond to SIT summons to appear before it.\n\nExplicit video clips allegedly involving Prajwal (33), who has since been suspended from the JD(S), had started making the rounds in Hassan in the run-up to the polls, following which the Congress-led state government constituted the SIT on April 28 to probe the charges against the MP.\n\nMeanwhile, the SIT has detained four more people in connection with the kidnapping case. The four -- all from Krishnaraja Nagara in Mysuru -- have been picked up to find out their role in the case, SIT officials said.\n\nSIT probe 'losing track'\n\nSenior Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Thursday alleged that the SIT probing into the sexual abuse charges against his nephew, Prajwal Revanna, is \"losing track\", and said his party would submit a memorandum to Karnataka governor Thaawarchand Gehlot.\n\nMaintaining that he wants the guilty to be punished by the law, Kumaraswamy raised questions on the progress of the probe by the SIT constituted by the Congress government.\n\n\"We are giving a memorandum to the Governor as to how the investigation is losing its track... I have been saying since day one that whoever has committed wrong has to be punished. Looking at the way in which things are going on, it looks like none of these people want the guilty punished but want publicity... What is the achievement (progress) since the investigation began?\" he told reporters.\n\nRaising questions regarding the investigation against Prajwal's father and his brother, HD Revanna, Kumaraswamy asked why the woman who was allegedly kidnapped has not been produced before the court so far, after she was rescued.\n\n\"It has been how many days since the kidnapped woman was brought here? Has her statement been recorded under section 164 of CrPC (statements recorded by a magistrate)? Has she been produced before the judge? It has been five days, why has the woman not been produced before the judge? From where was she brought? Was the 'mahazar' done? Was she brought from some farmhouse as claimed and reported in the media?\" Kumaraswamy asked.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigation_Team_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special Investigation Team (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Kumaraswamy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "H.

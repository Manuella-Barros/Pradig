Conway told MSNBC\u2019s Katie Phang on Saturday that testimony over the past few weeks showed that Trump is \u201cneck-deep\u201d in the case, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records. Conway added that it is \u201cgoing to be hard for the jury not to conclude that he [Trump] didn\u2019t cause all of this.\u201d All 12 of the jurors must agree to the same decision on each of the 34 counts against Trump, or the case ends up as a mistrial. Conway said that Trump\u2019s defense is just hoping for one juror to not agree to convict the former president. \u201cSo, the defense has its work cut out for it. But all the defense has to do is convince one juror to hang the group. I don\u2019t think they can get an acquittal. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get 12 votes unanimously to acquit him,\u201d he said. \u201cI think their best shot, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re gonna do, is hope that there\u2019s just some person on the jury who just refuses to convict.\u201d He also said that the defense needs to put together an \u201calternative explanation\u201d during closing arguments \u201cthat raises reasonable doubt.\u201d He noted that he is not sure what that alternative theory of the case would be. Trump\u2019s defense last week rested their case without calling the former president to the stand. The judge said last week that closing statements will begin on Tuesday, with jury deliberations to follow shortly afterward. The former president is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection to a reimbursement made to Trump\u2019s ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, for a payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels to stay quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all counts and has denied the affair. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

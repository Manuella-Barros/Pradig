The two testified in Massachusetts on the formation of a \"Harmony Commission\" to study and make recommendations related to the welfare and best interests of children in protection cases.\n\n\"The whole purpose of a statute like that is to have someone speak and represent a person not of an age able to speak or has a disability,\" said retired Juvenile Court Judge Carol Erskine, who finalized Jamison's adoption in November 2019. \"I'm just stunned by taking a position that they can't be in their court and tell Adam Montgomery just how the murder of Harmony impacted Jamison's life.\"\n\nThe couple says Jamison often speaks of Harmony and now says she is in heaven.\n\n\"Jamison is only 7 years old and only knows that Harmony has died.

We won't let that happen,\" said Johnathan Miller, who along with his husband Blair Miller is not allowed to give statements on Thursday. \"They're saying we can't speak on Jamison's behalf. It has to be his exact words related to the murder,\" said Miller.\n\nThe murder and its brutality is something Johnathan Miller says Jamison has yet to comprehend, that his understanding of why Harmony is gone is much different. \"Is she in heaven, is she safe, what happened to her glasses,\" Miller said.\n\nBut according to the New Hampshire Attorney General, \"The Court allows victims to designate a representative to write or speak on a victim's behalf, but it must be a reflection of the victim's words or other expressions of their feelings.\"\n\nMiller says, \"The fact the New Hampshire court wants Jamison to speak or write a statement about his sister's brutal murder only continues to victimize and traumatize him.\"\n\nRetired Massachusetts juvenile court judge Carol Erskine believes it's a ruling without precedent and has left her stunned. \"This is a narrative where it seems like the person who murdered Harmony has more rights about in terms of what's being said at victim impact statements than the actual victims. It's preposterous to think he could face Adam Montgomery or say words conveyed by two dads regarding how the murder impacted him,\" said Erskine.\n\nMiller says he just learned a judge will rule prior to the sentencing about whether he or his husband will be able to speak and he knows what he wants to convey. \"It's important that Adam, that monster, hears what he's done to Jamison and the void that he has left in his heart,\" Miller said.\n\nProsecutors are seeking 56 years to life, and the judge has ruled that Adam Montgomery has to be present for the sentencing.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/08/e722cd65-ca71-45f5-8c5a-00bc2dd15cca/thumbnail/1200x630/996450c4b3b0bc6fefc6b9669560224c/miller.jpg?v=3a71db5e6dd1c027f95668a1c7b6fcaf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555161", "eventUri": "eng-9555161", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

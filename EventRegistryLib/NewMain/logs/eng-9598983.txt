The rebuilding and repairing of the pier will take at least over a week,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said. \"Upon completion of the pier ... the intention is to re-anchor the temporary pier to the coast of Gaza and resume humanitarian aid.\"\n\nIn the next two days, the pier will be removed from its anchored position and towed back to the Israeli port city of Ashdod where U.S. Central Command forces will conduct repairs.\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four U.S. Army vessels that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier, which was anchored into the beach and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nAs of Tuesday, one vessel that was beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon has been recovered, Singh said. The second vessel beached near Ashkelon will be recovered in the next 24 hours. The remaining two vessels that were beached near the pier are expected to be recovered in the next 48 hours.\n\nThe pier costs about $320 million and involves roughly 1,000 American forces.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS, pier is meant to provide another way to deliver needed aid into Gaza. The World Health Organization has warned some 2.3 million Gaza inhabitants face extreme hunger that could become a full-blown famine as Israel continues its war against Hamas militants who launched a surprise assault in October from the enclave.\n\nPresident Joe Biden first announced the JLOTS operation on March 7. One day later, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the top Pentagon spokesman, said the temporary pier would be operational within about 60 days.\n\nThe temporary pier was installed after being delayed due to weather conditions in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and delivery of aid began nearly two weeks ago.\n\nRyder told reporters last week that more than 569 metric tons of humanitarian assistance had been delivered through the temporary pier to the shore of Gaza to be distributed to humanitarian partners. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said last week that some aid had been delivered to \"Palestinians that specifically need it.\"\n\nVice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of CENTCOM, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, said last week that three service members suffered noncombat-related injuries helping deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Singh said Tuesday that one service member remains in critical condition.\n\nThe suspension of the pier comes as more than 1,000 metric tons of aid have been delivered.\n\nThe flow of aid starts in Cyprus, where it is inspected and loaded onto ships to travel about 200 miles to the floating pier in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once it arrives, the aid is transferred by U.S. military vessels to the causeway attached to the Gaza coast. From there, trucks driven by a third party take the aid into Gaza, not the U.S. military.\n\n\"Some of that aid that is currently in Cyprus is being loaded onto vessels. So, when the pier is re-anchored back onto the Gaza shore, that aid will already be prepositioned and roll off pretty immediately,\" Singh said.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news",

The U.S. military worked with the U.N. and Israeli officials to select safer alternate routes for trucks, the Pentagon said Friday.\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier, which was anchored into the beach and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nTwo of the vessels were beached on Gaza and two others on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon.\n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been announced publicly.\n\nBefore the weather damage and suspension, the pier had begun to pick up steam and as of Friday more than 820 metric tons of food aid had been delivered from the sea onto the Gaza beach via the pier.\n\nU.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the pier cannot provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need and said that more checkpoints for humanitarian trucks need to be opened.\n\nAt maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for 500,000 of Gaza's people. U.S. officials stressed the need for open land crossings for the remaining 1.8 million.\n\nThe U.S. has also planned to continue to provide airdrops of food, which likewise cannot meet all the needs.\n\nA deepening Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it impossible for aid shipments to get through the crossing there, which is a key source for fuel and food coming into Gaza. Israel says it is bringing aid in through another border crossing, Kerem Shalom, but humanitarian organizations say Israeli military operations make it difficult for them to retrieve the aid there for distribution.", "source": {"uri": "ktvb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ktvb.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The pier is one of the few ways that food, water and other supplies are getting to Palestinians who the U.N. says are on the brink of famine amid the nearly eight-month-old Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. WASHINGTON (AP) - A U.S. built temporary pier that had been used to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza was damaged by rough seas and has temporarily suspended operations, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The pier will be repaired, but it was not immediately clear how long that will take, a fourth U.S. official told the AP. The Joint Logistics Over The Shore, or JLOTS, pier only began operations in the past two weeks and had provided an additional way to get critically needed food to Gaza. The setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which has already had three U.S. service member injuries and had four if its vessels beached due to heavy seas. Deliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead. The U.S. military worked with the U.N. and Israeli officials to select safer alternate routes for trucks, the Pentagon said Friday. The pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier, which was anchored into the beach and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore. Two of the vessels were beached on Gaza and two others on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been announced publicly. Before the weather damage and suspension, the pier had begun to pick up steam and as of Friday more than 820 metric tons of food aid had been delivered from the sea onto the Gaza beach via the pier.

She said the fixes will take \"at least over a week\" and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.\n\n\"From when it was operational, it was working, and we just had sort of an unfortunate confluence of weather storms that made it inoperable for a bit,\" Singh said. \"Hopefully just a little over a week, we should be back up and running.\"\n\nThe pier, used to carry in humanitarian aid arriving by sea, is one of the few ways that free food and other supplies are getting to Palestinians who the U.N. says are on the brink of famine amid the nearly 8-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe two main crossings in southern Gaza, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the U.N. because of fighting nearby as Israel pushes into Rafah. The pier and two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza are where most of the incoming humanitarian aid has entered in the past three weeks.\n\nThe setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which only began operations in the past two weeks and has already had three U.S. service members injured and had four vessels beached due to heavy seas. Two of the service members received minor injuries but the third is still in critical condition, Singh said.\n\nDeliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead.\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier. The system is anchored into the beach in Gaza and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nTwo of the vessels got stuck on the coast of Israel. One has already been recovered and the other will be in the next 24 hours with the help of the Israeli military, Singh said. The other two boats were stranded on the beach in Gaza and were expected to be recovered in the next two days, she said.\n\nThe suspension of the pier comes after the new sea route had begun to pick up steam, with more than 1,000 metric tons of food aid delivered.\n\nU.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the pier cannot provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need and said that more checkpoints for humanitarian trucks need to be opened.

She said the fixes will take \"at least over a week\" and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.\n\n\"From when it was operational, it was working, and we just had sort of an unfortunate confluence of weather storms that made it inoperable for a bit,\" Singh said. \"Hopefully just a little over a week, we should be back up and running.\"\n\nThe pier, used to carry in humanitarian aid arriving by sea, is one of the few ways that free food and other supplies are getting to Palestinians who the U.N. says are on the brink of famine amid the nearly 8-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe two main crossings in southern Gaza, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the U.N. because of fighting nearby as Israel pushes into Rafah. The pier and two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza are where most of the incoming humanitarian aid has entered in the past three weeks.\n\nThe setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which only began operations in the past two weeks and has already had three U.S. service members injured and had four vessels beached due to heavy seas. Two of the service members received minor injuries but the third is still in critical condition, Singh said.\n\nDeliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead.\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier. The system is anchored into the beach in Gaza and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nTwo of the vessels got stuck on the coast of Israel. One has already been recovered and the other will be in the next 24 hours with the help of the Israeli military, Singh said. The other two boats were stranded on the beach in Gaza and were expected to be recovered in the next two days, she said.\n\nThe suspension of the pier comes after the new sea route had begun to pick up steam, with more than 1,000 metric tons of food aid delivered.\n\nU.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the pier cannot provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need and said that more checkpoints for humanitarian trucks need to be opened. At maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for 500,000 of Gaza's people, and U.S. officials have stressed the need for open land crossings for the remaining 1.8 million.\n\nThe U.S. also has planned to continue to provide airdrops of food, which likewise cannot meet all the needs.\n\nA deepening Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it impossible for aid shipments to get through the crossing there, which is a key source for fuel and food coming into Gaza.

She said the fixes will take \"at least over a week\" and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.\n\n\"From when it was operational, it was working, and we just had sort of an unfortunate confluence of weather storms that made it inoperable for a bit,\" Singh said. \"Hopefully just a little over a week, we should be back up and running.\"\n\nThe pier, used to carry in humanitarian aid arriving by sea, is one of the few ways that free food and other supplies are getting to Palestinians who the U.N. says are on the brink of famine amid the nearly 8-month-old war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\n\nRelated Story: Israeli Strikes Kill 37 Palestinians Near Gaza's Rafah as Offensive ...\n\nThe two main crossings in southern Gaza, Rafah from Egypt and Kerem Shalom from Israel, are either not operating or are largely inaccessible for the U.N. because of fighting nearby as Israel pushes into Rafah. The pier and two crossings from Israel in northern Gaza are where most of the incoming humanitarian aid has entered in the past three weeks.\n\nThe setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which only began operations in the past two weeks and has already had three U.S. service members injured and had four vessels beached due to heavy seas. Two of the service members received minor injuries but the third is still in critical condition, Singh said.\n\nDeliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead.\n\nRelated Story: UC Berkeley Faces a Summer of Discontent as Gaza Protesters Remain Steadfast\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier. The system is anchored into the beach in Gaza and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nTwo of the vessels got stuck on the coast of Israel. One has already been recovered and the other will be in the next 24 hours with the help of the Israeli military, Singh said. The other two boats were stranded on the beach in Gaza and were expected to be recovered in the next two days, she said.\n\nThe suspension of the pier comes after the new sea route had begun to pick up steam, with more than 1,000 metric tons of food aid delivered.\n\nRelated Story: The Bodies of 3 More Hostages Are Recovered from Gaza by the Israeli Army\n\nU.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized that the pier cannot provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need and said that more checkpoints for humanitarian trucks need to be opened. At maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for 500,000 of Gaza's people, and U.S. officials have stressed the need for open land crossings for the remaining 1.8 million.\n\nThe U.S. also has planned to continue to provide airdrops of food, which likewise cannot meet all the needs.\n\nA deepening Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it impossible for aid shipments to get through the crossing there, which is a key source for fuel and food coming into Gaza. Israel says it is bringing aid in through another border crossing, Kerem Shalom, but humanitarian organizations say Israeli military operations make it difficult for them to retrieve the aid there for

Officials said it disconnected on Sunday, according to CNN.\n\nThe broader parking area must be connected to the causeway before the pier can be used.\n\nThe pier cost $320m and its usage started on 17 May, but heavy seas forced a stoppage just a week later. The pier broke apart two days later.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Tuesday that a \"great deal of humanitarian assistance\" has been \"flowing\" into Gaza.\n\n\"There has been ... a great deal that has been delivered into the north of Gaza over the past few weeks, something that happened because of the United States' intervention,\" he added.\n\nHowever, he said getting aid into southern Gaza has been \"a real challenge\".\n\n\"There are a number of things that have made that a challenge, one being the closing of Rafah gate, two being the military ... operations that are taking place there that make it tough,\" he said.\n\nThe temporary pier is located just north of Rafah in southern Gaza.\n\nThe pier was damaged three days after heavy seas led to two US Army vessels having to beach in Israel, US Central Command said. Another two vessels anchored close to the pier broke free of their moorings and beached in Gaza.\n\nThe temporary pier is known as the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), and can only operate in good conditions - meaning that it can safely be used in at most waves up to three feet and in winds under 15 miles per hour, CNN noted.\n\nHeavy seas meant the pier was delayed for weeks while it awaited better conditions sitting in Ashdod. The US has said that the pier was only intended as an add-on to aid going through traditional land crossings.\n\nThe pier was first announced by President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address in March.\n\nA US defense official said a US service member is in critical condition after suffering a noncombat injury on the pier last week, according to NBC.\n\nThe damage to the pier comes as a deadly strike in Rafah sparked a global outcry. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that a \"tragic mishap\" led to the Israeli strike that set fire to a camp for displaced Palestinians. Local officials said at least 45 people were killed.

The Associated Press reported that Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh announced on Tuesday the pier will be pulled out and sent to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, where U.S. Central Command will repair it. Singh said the fixes will take \"at least over a week,\" and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.\n\nThe rough seas also caused one of the boats that are used to ferry aid between ships and the pier to become beached.\n\nCNN reported that part of the pier disconnected on Sunday. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe pier had only been in operation for two weeks before needing repairs. In that time, the Department of Defense admitted none of the 500 metric tons of aid reached the intended people in Gaza. The trucks carrying the aid had been looted before reaching their final destination.\n\nBefore that, the pier, costing the U.S. over $320 million to build, ran into other severe problems before it started operating. While it was being constructed in April, the pier came under fire from mortar shells. While workers were forced to find cover, no one was injured. None of the terrorist groups in Gaza took credit for the attack.\n\nThe rough seas also caused one of the boats that are used to ferry aid between ships and the pier to become beached on the shores of Israel for multiple days.

Two other boats broke free of their moorings and had to be anchored near the pier.\n\nFive days ago, U.S. Central Command announced a U.S. service member had sustained a non-combat-related injury aboard MV Benavidez (T-AKR 306) while in support of the humanitarian aid mission to Gaza.

Deliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead.

The mission reportedly involved fourteen ships from the US and other countries. At the same time, the US sent billions of dollars of weapons to \"Israel\" amid its genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn its inaugural week of operations, only 820 tons of aid were transported through the pier, with approximately two-thirds reaching distribution points within Gaza, according to the Pentagon's statement on Thursday. This falls well short of the initial target of 90 truckloads per day and accounts for just 15% of the estimated minimum daily requirement for a population of over two million people facing famine.\n\nWeather conditions present a significant challenge, with rough seas in the Mediterranean posing a threat to the pier's integrity and safety.

The Joint Logistics Over The Shore, or JLOTS, pier only began operations in the past two weeks and had provided an additional way to get critically needed food to Gaza. The setback is the latest for the $320 million pier, which has already had three U.S. service member injuries and had four if its vessels beached due to heavy seas. Deliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead. The U.S. military worked with the U.N. and Israeli officials to select safer alternate routes for trucks, the Pentagon said Friday. The pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier, which was anchored into the beach and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore. Two of the vessels were beached on Gaza and two others on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been announced publicly.

The U.S. has also planned to continue to provide airdrops of food, which likewise cannot meet all the needs.

The pier was constructed with the intent of providing more critical aid in a humanitarian crisis brought on by the Israel-Hamas war, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n\"Four U.S. Army vessels supporting the maritime humanitarian aid mission in Gaza were affected by heavy sea states, causing these motorized pier sections which are used to stabilize the Trident pier to break free from their anchors due to a lapse in power and subsequently beach ashore,\" Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Tuesday.\n\nTwo of the Army vessels that broke free were beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. One has been recovered and the other will be recovered in the next 24 hours, Singh said.\n\nThe remaining two vessels that were beached near the Trident pier are expected to be recovered in the next 48 hours with help from the Israeli Navy. Over the next two days, the pier anchored into the shores of Gaza will be removed and towed to Ashdod for repairs by CENTCOM officials, Singh said.\n\n\"There was an unfortunate, unique pattern of events with high seas and another storm that came in that caused the JLOTS to become inoperable during that time,\" Singh said.\n\nSome U.S. aid in Cyprus is already being loaded onto vessels so when the pier is re-anchored, aid is prepositioned for roll-off \"immediately,\" she said.\n\n\"The rebuilding and repairing of the pier will take at least over a week and following completion will need to be re-anchored to the coast of Gaza,\" Singh said. \"Upon completion of the pier, repair, and reassembly, the intention is to re-anchor the temporary pier to the coast of Gaza and resume humanitarian aid to the people who need it most.\"\n\nThe JLOTs setback is the latest problem for the pier project which has already resulted in three U.S. service member injuries - two minor and one who remains in critical condition. The temporary pier was announced after international humanitarian air drops resulted in several fatalities and as on-the-ground aid convoys continue to be restricted.\n\nSince aid began flowing through the pier Friday, more than 1,000 metric tons of humanitarian supplies have been delivered to the marshaling area for distribution to Gazans by humanitarian organizations, Singh said. In early May, CENTCOM said that the U.S. had dropped nearly 1,220 tons of humanitarian assistance to date.\n\nAccording to USAID, American-provided aid packages include nutrient-rich food, plastic sheeting for shelter, jerry cans to hold clean water, and hygiene kits.\n\nSubscribe to Task & Purpose today.

It is meant to augment, not replace or substitute for land crossings into Gaza,\" said Daniel Dieckhaus, Director, U.S. Agency for International Development's Levant Response Management Team at a Pentagon briefing Friday.\n\nOver the past two weeks, less than 100 aid trucks have entered Gaza daily which is \"far less than the 600 needed every day to address the threat of Famine,\" USAID officials said in a release.\n\nLast week, officials noted security concerns with the aid distribution including \"potential looting along a prearranged distribution route\" and a recent Hamas drone attack on the IDF which led \"to the temporary shutdown of humanitarian convoys around Gaza for safety reasons,\" Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, Deputy Commander, United States Central Command said Friday.\n\nWhile the U.S. has promised no boots on the ground in Gaza, Israeli media outlets have shared photos of U.S. service members on Israeli beaches where a vessel washed ashore as far north as Ashdod, a city in Israel roughly halfway between the Gaza Strip and Tel Aviv.\n\nThe JLOTS concept isn't new for the U.S. military. In 2023, the Army used JLOTs in an international exercise with Australia called Talisman Sabre to practice military logistics in the event of conflict in the Asia Pacific region.

The setback follows previous issues, including injuries and beached vessels. Despite successfully delivering food aid, officials emphasize the need for more land crossings to meet Gaza's needs.\n\nA US built temporary pier that had been used to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza was damaged by rough seas and has temporarily suspended operations, three US officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nThe Joint Logistics Over The Shore, or JLOTS, pier only began operations in the past two weeks and had provided an additional way to get critically needed food to Gaza.\n\nThe setback is the latest for the USD 320 million pier, which has already had three US service member injuries and had four if its vessels beached due to heavy seas. Deliveries also were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks coming from the pier and one Palestinian man was shot dead. The US military worked with the UN and Israeli officials to select safer alternate routes for trucks, the Pentagon said Friday.\n\nThe pier was fully functional as late as Saturday when heavy seas unmoored four of the Army boats that were being used to ferry pallets of aid from commercial vessels to the pier, which was anchored into the beach and provided a long causeway for trucks to drive that aid onto the shore.\n\nTwo of the vessels were beached on Gaza and two others on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon.\n\nThe officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that had not yet been announced publicly.\n\nBefore the weather damage and suspension, the pier had begun to pick up steam and as of Friday more than 820 metric tonnes of food aid had been delivered from the sea onto the Gaza beach via the pier.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly emphasised that the pier cannot provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need and stressed that more checkpoints for humanitarian trucks need to be opened.\n\nAt maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for 500,000 of Gaza's people.

The Saturday mishap is the latest setback for the US humanitarian aid project, after three US troops were reported injured aboard the pier two days prior, including one critically.\n\nThe Times of Isreal's military correspondent Emanuel Fabian has reported that \"An American vessel used to unload humanitarian aid from ships into the Gaza Strip via a floating pier disconnected from a small boat tugging it this morning due to stormy seas, leading it to get stuck on the coast of Ashdod, eyewitnesses say.\"\n\nThe recovery operation has not gone well either, as \"Another ship was then sent to try and extract the stuck vessel, but also got beached,\" Fabian writes.\n\nAnd yet a second US Army vessel also got stuck in shallow waters while trying to rescue the pier section. Overnight US ships had been moving two pieces of the floating pier to the Port of Ashdod in southern Israel when the now beached section detached and drifted away. American troops can be seen in footage standing helplessly on the beach.\n\nAn official US Central Command (CENTCOM) statement says the following:\n\nThis morning four U.S. Army vessels supporting the maritime humanitarian aid mission in Gaza were affected by heavy sea states. The vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier.\n\nThe third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy.\n\nThe pier operation was already last week off to a rough start -- and was paused for two days -- after desperate Palestinians mobbed and ransacked the first trucks transporting aid unloaded from the pier before they could reach a distribution warehouse managed by the World Food Programme.\n\nThe pier has been center of controversy, given a number of land routes for aid into Gaza are possible, but have been blocked by Israel's military.\n\nNow, to mitigate that devastation amid reports of famine the US government has spent $320 million to build a pier to bypass its own beneficiary's land-route blockade. But operating it has proven tricky especially due to inclement conditions in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAt best, the pier will only put a dent in the daunting humanitarian challenge. \"I just want to be clear that this humanitarian maritime corridor alone is not enough to meet the staggering needs in Gaza, but it is an important addition,\" said USAID Levant response management team director Daniel Dieckhaus. \"It is meant to augment, not replace or substitute for land crossings into Gaza.\"\n\nAt this point, with a section of the pier stuck on an Israel beach, and coming over two months after President Biden first unveiled the ambitious project, the whole initiative is becoming a bit of an embarrassment involving setback after setback.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/brokenpier.jpg?itok=r1NVQ-th", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\n\"I believe most of our soldiers were able to remain on the vessels and still are currently on them,\" Singh said during Tuesday's Pentagon press briefing. \"And ... within the next 24 or 48 hours, the Israeli Navy will be helping push those vessels back and hopefully they'll be fully operational by then.\"\n\nThe pier, which cost $320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nThe US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tons of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations.\n\nDaniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID's Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \"thousands and thousands of tons\" of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable.\n\nCNN's Paul Murphy contributed reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the pier broke apart on Tuesday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Now the effort is on hold for at least a week.\n\nSabrina Singh, the deputy press secretary for the defence department, told reporters that high seas and a north African weather system had caused a section of the pier to come away on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe pier will be pulled out and sent to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, where US Central Command (Centcom) will repair it.\n\n\"The rebuilding and repairing of the pier will take at least over a week, and, following completion, will need to be re-anchored to the coast of Gaza,\" Singh said.\n\n\"Thus, upon completion of the pier repair and reassembly, the intention is to re-anchor the temporary pier to the coast of Gaza and resume humanitarian aid to the people who need it most.\"\n\nThe White House insisted that the pier is still viable as a supplement to aid routes. John Kirby, a spokesperson for the national security council, told reporters: \"It was never intended to supplant what you can do on the ground through trucks and getting those crossings open.\n\n\"We said that from the get go. We also said it's going to be tough. It's been tough. Weather plays a role. Mother Nature has a say here and the eastern Med, even in the summertime, can be a pretty rough place and that's what's happening right now.\"\n\nBut Kirby added: \"Can it be a force multiplier? Can it add to? Absolutely, and I think they've so far gotten more than a thousand metric tonnes in just off the temporary pier alone which, considering the weather, considering the complexity of doing it that way - the multi-node stop you have to do to move from ship to pier to truck to ground - that's still an impressive record so far.\"\n\nThe damage is the latest setback to the pier, which opened two weeks ago, and is likely to be seized on by Joe Biden's critics as a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nCentcom said on Saturday four US army vessels supporting the pier broke free from their moorings and ran aground in heavy seas. Two beached in Gaza while the other two washed up on the coast of Israel, 30 miles south of Tel Aviv. One has been recovered and the other three will be brought back in within 48 hours, Singh said.\n\nBiden had said in March the pier would be built to alleviate restrictions imposed by Israel on aid delivery by land to Gaza.

The pier will be removed from its location on the Gaza coast over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where US Central Command will carry out repairs, Singh said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating.\n\nEarlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas.\n\nPart of the pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\n\"I believe most of our soldiers were able to remain on the vessels and still are currently on them,\" Singh said during Tuesday's Pentagon press briefing. \"And ... within the next 24 or 48 hours, the Israeli Navy will be helping push those vessels back and hopefully they'll be fully operational by then.\"\n\nThe pier, which cost US$320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nThe US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tons of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations.\n\nDaniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID's Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \"thousands and thousands of tons\" of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable.\n\nCNN", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2024/05/us-military-pier-for-transporting-aid-to-gaza-breaks-apart/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1716926682975/1120_Credit_MaxarTechnologies_gaza_pier_290524.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1705, "textEnd": 1711}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1784, "textEnd": 1790}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

One Palestinian man was shot dead.\n\nThe US military later worked with the UN and Israeli officials to chart a safer alternate route for the trucks, the Pentagon said on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, CENTCOM said four US Army vessels supporting the pier broke free from their moorings and ran aground in heavy seas. Two beached in Gaza while the other two washed up on the Israeli coast, 50km (30 miles) south of Tel Aviv.\n\nSingh said one had been recovered and the other three will be brought back in within 48 hours.\n\nAt maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for around 500,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to US officials, who have said the delivery mechanism is only meant to supplement

According to the Pentagon, the project is expected to cost the US around $320 million.\n\nFour vessels were disconnected from a jetty on Saturday, CENTCOM said, adding that there were no deaths or injuries, and that the pier's operations were unaffected.\n\nThe first ship became stuck on a beach in the Israeli port city of Ashdod, and another vessel sent to extract it also ran aground, the Times of Israel reported.\n\n\"Two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier,\" CENTCOM said, adding that the third and fourth ships were beached on the coast near the Israeli city of Ashkelon.\n\nAccording to CENTCOM, efforts to recover the vessels are being assisted by the Israeli military. \"No US personnel will enter Gaza\" during the operation, it stressed.\n\nEarlier this week, three US soldiers were injured while working on the pier, and one required hospitalization in Israel.\n\nThe UN, which distributes aid from trucks ferried by US ships to the pier, said deliveries had to be halted on Sunday and Monday after Palestinians rushed at the moving trucks and looted their entire cargo. The capture \"represents a minority of the overall shipments,\" Daniel Dieckhaus, USAID's Gaza Response Manager, said in a briefing on Friday.\n\n\"This humanitarian maritime corridor alone is not enough to meet the staggering needs in Gaza, but it is an important addition. It is meant to augment, not replace or substitute for land crossings into Gaza,\" Dieckhaus told reporters.\n\nThe pier - which is able to carry only a small fraction of the humanitarian aid that could potentially be brought through Israel-controlled land routes into Gaza - has been slammed by US lawmakers citing the high cost and danger to personnel.\n\nEarlier this month the UN warned that the humanitarian aid ground route had been completely blockaded due to Israel's offensive in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Egypt has maintained a blockade on the Rafah crossing since Israel forces captured the Gaza side of the border.\n\nEgypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi agreed on Friday to funnel humanitarian aid trucks to the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, at the border juncture between Egypt, Israel and Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "northernirelandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northern Ireland News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/rtc1716718462.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

No injuries were reported, and the pier remains fully functional, according to the statement.\n\nA tugboat and a landing craft mechanized (LCM) washed ashore in Israel, a U.S. official confirmed to NPR. LCMs transport vehicles and were notably used during World War II for amphibious landings of troops and tanks.\n\nThis comes just days after a U.S. service member was hospitalized for a serious injury sustained during the Gaza aid pier operation. Two other service members had minor injuries. None of the injuries were the result of combat.\n\nThe temporary pier, situated just north of Rafah, was recently erected by U.S. troops to expand the flow of food and other supplies to starving Palestinians as Israel's war against Hamas continues.

Overnight US ships had been moving two pieces of the floating pier to the Port of Ashdod in southern Israel when the now beached section detached and drifted away. American troops can be seen in footage standing helplessly on the beach.\n\nAn official US Central Command (CENTCOM) statement says the following:\n\nThis morning four U.S. Army vessels supporting the maritime humanitarian aid mission in Gaza were affected by heavy sea states. The vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier.\n\nThe third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy.\n\nThe pier operation was already last week off to a rough start -- and was paused for two days -- after desperate Palestinians mobbed and ransacked the first trucks transporting aid unloaded from the pier before they could reach a distribution warehouse managed by the World Food Programme.\n\nThe pier has been center of controversy, given a number of land routes for aid into Gaza are possible, but have been blocked by Israel's military.\n\nNow, to mitigate that devastation amid reports of famine the US government has spent $320 million to build a pier to bypass its own beneficiary's land-route blockade. But operating it has proven tricky especially due to inclement conditions in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nAt best, the pier will only put a dent in the daunting humanitarian challenge. \"I just want to be clear that this humanitarian maritime corridor alone is not enough to meet the staggering needs in Gaza, but it is an important addition,\" said USAID Levant response management team director Daniel Dieckhaus. \"It is meant to augment, not replace or substitute for land crossings into Gaza.\"\n\nAt this point, with a section of the pier stuck on an Israel beach, and coming over two months after President Biden first unveiled the ambitious project, the whole initiative is becoming a bit of an embarrassment involving setback after setback.", "source": {"uri": "fromthetrenchesworldreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "From the Trenches World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Mediterranean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Mediterranean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/brokenpier.jpg?itok=nIML84M6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Israel has said it does not recognize the ICJ's authority, and while its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ itself has no enforcement powers.\n\nAlso yesterday, in a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi agreed to restart aid truck deliveries into Rafah and to allow the flow of humanitarian assistance through the Kerem Shalom crossing \"on a provisional basis.\"\n\nAccording to the World Food Programme, about half of the total population of Gaza -- roughly 1.1 million Palestinians -- are at catastrophic levels of hunger.\n\nAs of Thursday, 1.2 million pounds of aid had been transferred through the temporary pier to Gaza's shore.

That reflects the larger problems bringing food and other supplies to starving people in the besieged territory.\n\nThe floating pier had a troubled launch, with crowds overrunning some of the first trucks coming from the new US-led sea route and taking its contents over the weekend. One man in the crowd was shot dead in still-unexplained circumstances. It led to a two-day suspension of aid distribution.\n\nThe US military worked with the UN and Israeli officials to select safer alternate routes for trucks coming from the pier, US Vice Admiral Brad Cooper told reporters Thursday.\n\nAs a result, the US pier on Wednesday accounted for 27 of the 70 total trucks of aid that the UN was able to round up from all land and sea crossings into Gaza for distribution to civilians, the United States said.\n\nThat's a fraction of the 150 truckloads of food, emergency nutrition treatment and other supplies that US officials aim to bring in when the sea route is working at maximum capacity.\n\nPlus, Gaza needs 600 trucks entering each day, according to the US Agency for International Development, to curb a famine that the heads of USAID and the UN World Food Program have said has begun in the north and to keep it from spreading south.\n\nOnly one of the 54 trucks that came from the pier Tuesday and Wednesday encountered any security issues on their way to aid warehouses and distribution points, US officials said. They called the issues \"minor\" but gave no details.\n\nA deepening Israeli offensive in the southern city of Rafah has made it impossible for aid shipments to get through the crossing there, which is a key source for fuel and food coming into Gaza. Israel says it is bringing aid in through another border crossing, Kerem Shalom, but humanitarian organizations say Israeli military operations make it difficult for them to retrieve the aid there for distribution.\n\nThe Biden administration last week launched the $320 million floating pier for a new maritime aid route into Gaza as the seven-month-old Israel-Hamas war and Israeli restrictions on land crossings have severely limited food deliveries to 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\nFor all humanitarian efforts, \"the risks are manifold,\" Daniel Dieckhaus, USAID's response director for Gaza, said at a briefing with Cooper. \"This is an active conflict with deteriorating conditions.\"\n\nDieckhaus rejected charges from some aid groups that the pier is diverting attention from what the US, UN and relief workers say is the essential need for Israel to allow full access to land crossings for humanitarian shipments.\n\nFor instance, Jeremy Konyndyk, a former USAID official now leading Refugees International, tweeted that \"the pier is humanitarian theater.\"\n\n\"I would not call, within a couple of days, getting enough food and other supplies for tens of thousands of people for a month theater,\" Dieckhaus said Thursday when asked about the criticism.\n\nAt maximum capacity, the pier would bring in enough food for 500,000 of Gaza's people. US officials stressed the need for flow through open land crossings for the remaining 1.8 million.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugees International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Border control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://asianlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Heavy-seas-batter-US-Gaza-maritime-aid-mission.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy.\"\n\nAt the time, CENTCOM said that the Israeli Defense Forces would support the recovery efforts near the pier and that the pier remained fully functional.\n\nThe rough seas off of Gaza had earlier led to delay in the initial deployment of the JLOTS systems, forcing the U.S. military to eventually set it up in calmer seas off of Ashdod, Israel, before moving it down to waters off of Gaza.\n\nIt is unclear whether this latest setback will lead to consideration of other alternative ways of transporting the aid from Cyprus into Gaza.\n\nThis is a developing story.

The pier will be removed from its location on the Gaza coast over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod, where US Central Command will carry out repairs, Singh said. The repairs will take more than a week, further delaying the effort to get the maritime corridor fully operating.\n\nEarlier, four US officials told CNN the pier broke apart in heavy seas.\n\nPart of the pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe damage, first reported by NBC News, occurred three days after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\n\"I believe most of our soldiers were able to remain on the vessels and still are currently on them,\" Singh said during Tuesday's Pentagon press briefing. \"And ... within the next 24 or 48 hours, the Israeli Navy will be helping push those vessels back and hopefully they'll be fully operational by then.\"\n\nThe pier, which cost $320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nThe US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tons of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population. The Pentagon said Thursday that more than 1,000 metric tons of aid had been delivered before the temporary pier had to halt operations.\n\nDaniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID's Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \"thousands and thousands of tons\" of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable.\n\nCNN's Paul Murphy contributed reporting.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

President Biden announced the project in March and White House touted it as a critical tool to get relief to the war-torn population.\n\nThe Biden administration had announced the pier as at least a temporary solution to reports of mass suffering and starvation in Gaza. With an estimated $320 million price tag, it provides a way to bring in relief from Cyprus even as Israel resists U.S. pressure to open more land routes for delivery of supplies.\n\nNow, it is set to be towed to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod for repairs which could take 'at least over a week,' Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe Pentagon blames rough seas for the problems with the pier. U.S. Central Command said choppy conditions caused four U.S. vessels to break free of the pier. Two of them washed up on shore in Gaza.\n\nRepairs on the U.S.-built floating pier could take more than a week, and relief aid deliveries using the pier to Gaza have been halted\n\nFootage from land shows the rusted hull of a U.S. Army ship that had been beached amid efforts to free it.

But in order to reassemble everything it's going to to detach from the coastline move up to Ashdod to be reassembled and then reattached - re-anchored back,' she said.\n\nSingh said the pier had handled about 1,000 metric tons (over 2,000 pounds) of aid had been delivered on the pier before it went offline.\n\nA U.S. Army landing craft is seen beached in Ashdod on Sunday, May 26, 2024, after being swept by wind and current from the temporary humanitarian pier in the Gaza Strip.

In early March, Joe Biden used his platform at the State of the Union to order the military to create a sea route to bring aid to the starving Palestinians. Nearly three months later, the pier has faced a series of cost overruns, injuries, and other setbacks.\n\nOn Saturday morning, rough seas broke off four vessels that appear to be serving as part of the pier. \"The vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier. The third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. Efforts to recover the vessels are underway with assistance from the Israeli Navy,\" a statement from US Central Command (CENTCOM) explained.\n\nThe Pentagon claims no US soldiers will enter Gaza to recover the pieces of the pier, and the Israeli military is helping to recover the four vessels. The Department of Defense said no one was injured in the incident and the pier is still functional.\n\nSince Biden announced the pier, the cost has doubled, three US soldiers were injured, and very little aid has entered Gaza. The US hopes that 150 trucks of aid will enter Gaza each day through the pier. Over the first week of operations only 71 trucks of assistance reached the Strip through the pier.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the process the aid must go through to enter Gaza via the sea route has a series of potential pitfalls. In Cyprus, the aid \"is screened and packaged onto shipping pallets. A large military or commercial ship then transports the pallets some 200 miles across the Mediterranean Sea to a floating platform built by the US,\" the writers explained.\"\n\n\"There, the pallets are put into trucks, which are driven onto smaller military vessels that carry them about 6 miles to a floating US-built causeway secured to the beach by Israeli army engineers.\" The WSJ adds, \"The trucks drive a few hundred feet down the causeway and onto the beach. In a zone protected by Israeli soldiers, aid workers transfer the pallets onto a separate fleet of trucks that are used by aid groups to complete the final leg to warehouses and distribution points inside Gaza.\"\n\nThe trucks that do make it to Gaza have faced restrictions placed by the Israeli military and starving Palestinians attempting to loot the trucks.\n\nThe lack of aid reaching Gaza is not the only problem the pier has encountered. On Thursday, the Pentagon reported three US soldiers suffered non-combat injuries. Additionally, Biden has been criticized by human rights groups for choosing to set up a complex sea route when he could pressure Israel to allow more aid into Gaza by land, a far faster method.\n\nStephane Dujarric, spokesperson of UN chief Antonio Guterres, said that the World Food Program explained, \"What we want to see, as we've been saying, is massive aid coming in through land routes.\"\n\nThe pier's latest failure comes as nearly all 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to find anything to eat, with many already suffering in famine conditions.

Less than two weeks after becoming operational, U.S. aid shipments have been halted fully after bad weather damaged and compromised the JLOTS pier, U.S. officials told multiple outlets on Tuesday.\n\nThe bad weather damage is the latest in a slew of issues the pier has faced since it became operational less than two weeks ago. Initial aid shipments through the pier last week were stolen almost immediately onshore by crowds of hungry civilians, raising concerns with aid distribution groups responsible for dolling out the aid properly.\n\nThree U.S. troops were injured in a non-combat incident on the floating pier last week during aid transfer operations, though the exact cause of the injuries has not been disclosed. One of the three troops suffered critical injuries and was evacuated to an Israeli hospital, where he is currently receiving emergency care.\n\nFour U.S. army vessels helping stabilize the pier became unmoored in choppy waters and bad weather over the weekend, which broke off part of the pier's support system. Two of the vessels floated north and landed on a beach in Ashdod, Israel. The two other vessels were anchored to the beach near the pier.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the pier as a signature project of his administration during the 2024 State of the Union (SOTU) in March.\n\n\"A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day,\" Biden said during his remarks at the SOTU.\n\nMore broadly, the pier itself can only play a small role in delivering the aid needed in Gaza, even when fully operational. The Biden administration hopes to deliver 90 trucks worth of aid to Gaza per day via the JLOTS pier in the interim, eventually up to 150 trucks once initial problems are smoothed over.

World Food Program to suspend operations. After officials beefed up security, the weather turned bad. American officials had been hoping that the sea surges would not start until later in the summer.\n\nOn Saturday, heavy seas forced two small American military vessels that were part of the pier operation to beach in Israel.

That part will have to be reconnected.\n\nThe pier is now being removed from the coast of Gaza to be repaired after getting damaged in the rough seas, Ms. Singh said.

Less than two weeks after becoming operational, U.S. aid shipments have been halted fully after bad weather damaged and compromised the JLOTS pier, U.S. officials told multiple outlets on Tuesday.\n\nThe bad weather damage is the latest in a slew of issues the pier has faced since it became operational less than two weeks ago. Initial aid shipments through the pier last week were stolen almost immediately onshore by crowds of hungry civilians, raising concerns with aid distribution groups responsible for dolling out the aid properly.\n\nThree U.S. troops were injured in a non-combat incident on the floating pier last week during aid transfer operations, though the exact cause of the injuries has not been disclosed. One of the three troops suffered critical injuries and was evacuated to an Israeli hospital, where he is currently receiving emergency care.\n\nFour U.S. army vessels helping stabilize the pier became unmoored in choppy waters and bad weather over the weekend, which broke off part of the pier's support system. Two of the vessels floated north and landed on a beach in Ashdod, Israel. The two other vessels were anchored to the beach near the pier.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the pier as a signature project of his administration during the 2024 State of the Union (SOTU) in March.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

The Biden administration hopes to deliver 90 trucks worth of aid to Gaza per day via the JLOTS pier in the interim, eventually up to 150 trucks once initial problems are smoothed over. But 300 to 500 trucks of aid per day is required to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the millions of Palestinians who have been displaced by the ongoing Israel-Hamas war; the majority of the aid is being delivered by truck convoys through border crossings in Israel and Egypt.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But then we were assured that there would be no \"boots on the ground\" in Gaza: the $320 million temporary pier would be built by U.S. troops floating offshore. The finished project would be pushed into place and even more humanitarian aid for find its way into Hamas' possession.\n\nAs we've said, the Biden administration can get things done when it really wants to. The pier was to be built within two months, and just this week, aid started to be trucked in over the pier, where it was promptly stolen.\n\nWhat's up with Biden's pier today? We don't know, but we're getting all sorts of news reports. According to AFP, four U.S. Army vessels have run aground near the pier.\n\nThe best AFP can report is:\n\nMeanwhile the US military said four of its vessels, supporting a temporary pier built to deliver aid to Gaza by sea, had run aground in heavy seas.\n\n\"No US personnel will enter Gaza. No injuries have been reported and the pier remains fully functional,\" a statement from US Central Command.\n\nSo four Army vessels have run aground \"near\" Gaza pier? That's sounding more and more like boots on the ground.\n\nSpeaking of heavy seas, some bad weather seems to have taken part of the pier apart.\n\nTrey Yingst, foreign correspondent for Fox News, is on the ground and seems to give the best description of what we're seeing in the videos embedded above:\n\nWhat's this? Troops got hurt, one critically? According to the New York Post, this happened just a couple days ago.\n\n\"Three US service members were injured, one critically, while working on the Army's Gaza aid pier on Thursday,\" reports the Post.\n\nThe controversial floating pier was announced by President Biden in March to facilitate humanitarian aid to millions in the Gaza strip during Israel's ongoing military offensive in the enclave.\n\nIt's estimated to cost about $320 million for its first 90 days after opening last Thursday and will be operated by about 1,000 US service members -- who Biden assured would not enter Gaza itself.\n\nBut Biden really needs to shake off that \"Genocide Joe\" label if he wants those sweet Gen Z votes.\n\nHere's President Biden just after the pier became operational:\n\nWe're hearing a lot of things, but we're going with Yingst, who's on the ground there and says a U.S. vessel and a piece of the floating pier are stuck on the beach.\n\nIn any case, it was a stupid idea to put U.S. troops in a warzone.", "source": {"uri": "twitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twitchy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_t@twitchy.com", "name": "Brett T.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/124/8090b213-ef61-48c3-8718-1b4e4b8e423e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

No injuries have been reported and the pier remains fully functional. We will release additional details as they become available.\"\n\nThe ships appeared to be Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) Mark 8s, part of the watercraft unit that was helping to build and guide the pier.\n\nA section of the pier was also beached, which could be used as a way for people to monitor the construction and movement.\n\nThe USAV Matamoros, a ship about the size of a football field, moved offshore of the Ashdod beach, appearing to assist in the rescue operations. At one point, Israeli forces tried to use a small drone to deliver a rope out to the Matamoros, but had to abandon the effort when the rope got caught up in the surf.\n\nThe ship had left Fort Eustis, Va., in March as part of the fleet dispatched to build the floating pier.\n\nThe crash landing of the American army naval vessels on Israel's beaches underscored the challenge to the Biden

northern border.\n\nThe strength of the sea on Saturday, with 1.6 meter swells and wind speeds between 10 and 20 knots, offered a real-life demonstration about how weather can impede what was already an extraordinarily challenge route for aid deliveries.\n\nThe ships are part of the Biden administration's $320 million pier project to increase humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Gaza

following Hamas's Oct. 7th terrorist attack against Israel.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that the first few days of the pier's operation failed to reach the scale of supplies they had hoped to deliver.\n\nHumanitarian workers and aid groups have cited enormous challenges in providing assistance, with land crossings closed amid Israel's military operations, lack of resources to deliver aid and manage its distribution, as well as threats to lives of aid workers operating in a theater of conflict.\n\nThe news also comes after three U.S. soldiers assigned to the pier mission were injured

According to CNN, it will be removed from the coast of Gaza over the next 48 hours and taken to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs.\n\nJust a few days earlier, four vessels supporting the pier broke off their moorings due to heavy seas. Two of them washed up ashore, while the other two were able to drop anchor. Before that, the Pentagon said three US troops suffered non-combat injuries on the pier, which were likely also caused by rough seas.\n\nCNN previously reported that the pier could only be safely operated in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour. Heavier conditions caused a delay in the first aid deliveries through the pier, which only began on May 17, and were suspended for a few days due to distribution issues.\n\nBiden ordered the construction of the pier instead of pressuring Israel to open more land border crossings to aid deliveries, which is by far the most efficient way to get humanitarian assistance into Gaza.

The Pentagon said it is working to recover several vessels that were beached near the pier.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, the Trident pier will be \"removed from its anchored position on the coast and towed back to Ashdod where U.S. Central Command will conduct repairs,\" Ms. Singh added, noting that the repairs will take more than a week and then the pier will need to be re-anchored to the Gaza coast.\n\nThe Pentagon said the pier proved \"highly valuable\" in delivering aid and thus is intended to be re-anchored so that aid to Gaza can resume.\n\n\"To date, over 1,000 metric tons have been delivered from the pier to the marshaling area for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations and into the hands of Palestinians,\" Ms. Singh added while noting that the Pentagon hopes to get aid to Gaza as quickly as it can.\n\nWhen asked about aid that hasn't yet been delivered through the pier but was intended to be over the next week, Ms. Singh said some of it is \"being loaded into vessels\" so that it is in position to move through once the pier is re-anchored, while some of the aid's future will be determined in conversations with USAID about how to get it into Gaza. While the pier has been \"effective,\" she said, land routes are \"the most efficient way\" to move aid.\n\n\"You guys put a lot of money into this and then it didn't last, it lasted for less than two weeks,\" one attendee at the press conference said, asking whether \"poor planning and poor quality\" materials could have contributed.\n\n\"Over 1,000 metric tons of aid got to the people in Gaza, so I don't think that's a total loss,\" Ms. Singh responded, adding that it was important to get aid in by \"whatever means.\"\n\nLast week, however, a Pentagon official stated that hundreds of tons of aid meant to be delivered to Gazans via the pier never reached its intended recipients. Much of it, a Pentagon spokesman said, was looted from food trucks leaving the staging area or commandeered by Hamas terrorists.\n\n\"If you want to characterize it as a failure, I leave it to you, what I can tell you is that we don't control the weather,\" she said, adding that \"an unfortunate, unique pattern of events with high seas and another storm that came in\" caused it to be inoperable.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_hroncich@nysun.com", "name": "Maggie Hroncich", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trident"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staging_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Staging area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gaza-pier2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Many questioned why more efforts aren't being made by the U.S. and Israel to reach more Palestinians with humanitarian aid by land.\n\nJournalist Glenn Greenwald posted on X, formerly Twitter, \"It was a massive humiliation for Biden that Israel wouldn't let the U.S. deliver aid to Gaza by land and forced the U.S. to build this pier to try to get small amounts in. That it couldn't even be done properly and is now broken and floating in the sea is yet more humiliation.\"\n\n\"Why was a pier needed in the first place? There are land crossings, aid should be able to get into Gaza that way. Unless Israel is withholding humanitarian aid. If that's the case, under 620i of the Foreign Assistance Act, the U.S. is obliged to stop sending Israel weapons,\" said Nina Turner, a Senior Fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, on X.\n\n\"NEW - the U.S. has stopped all humanitarian aid efforts using the DOD-constructed maritime pier, which is now heavily damaged & floating adrift after bad weather. Who'd have thought -- maybe it would have been better to simply deliver aid via #Gaza's 7x land crossings?\" Charles Lister, Director of the Syria and Countering Terrorism & Extremism programs at the Middle East Institute, said on X.\n\nNewsweek emailed the U.S. Department of Defense Tuesday afternoon for additional comment about the pier's closure.\n\nThe pier's removal for repair is the latest setback for the Biden administration's initiative.\n\nOver the last two weeks, three U.S. service members have been injured and four vessels have been beached due to heavy seas around the pier, named the Joint Logistics Over The Shore (JLOTS) pier. Two of the service members received minor injuries but the third is still in critical condition, Singh said Tuesday.\n\nDeliveries were halted for two days last week after crowds rushed aid trucks and one Palestinian man was shot and killed.\n\nHowever, more than 500 metric tons of aid offloaded at the pier has been handed off to humanitarian partners, two-thirds of which are in the process of reaching those in need, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said last week, according to CNN.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that at least a quarter of the Gaza Strip population is on the brink of famine.\n\nBiden announced the pier in March with the hope of averting famine in northern Gaza by providing seaborne access for assistance, as calls grew for Israel to ease access for relief supplies into the territory via land routes.\n\nU.S. officials have emphasized that the pier isn't enough to provide the amount of aid that starving Gazans need.\n\nThe Pentagon said the project involved about 1,000 U.S. service members, mostly from the Army and Navy. One U.S. defense official told Reuters the cost had risen to $320 million -- double the original estimate from earlier this year.\n\nThis caused concern among some, such as Mississippi Republican Senator Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Democratic-led Senate Armed Services Committee, who told the agency the cost had \"exploded\" and was a \"dangerous effort with marginal benefit.\"",

Less than two weeks after becoming operational, U.S. aid shipments have been halted fully after bad weather damaged and compromised the JLOTS pier, U.S. officials told multiple outlets on Tuesday. (RELATED: 'Terrible Idea': Biden's Gaza Aid Scheme Puts Troops At Risk To Appease Voters, Experts Say)\n\nThe bad weather damage is the latest in a slew of issues the pier has faced since it became operational less than two weeks ago. Initial aid shipments through the pier last week were stolen almost immediately onshore by crowds of hungry civilians, raising concerns with aid distribution groups responsible for dolling out the aid properly.\n\nThree U.S. troops were injured in a non-combat incident on the floating pier last week during aid transfer operations, though the exact cause of the injuries has not been disclosed. One of the three troops suffered critical injuries and was evacuated to an Israeli hospital, where he is currently receiving emergency care.\n\nFour U.S. army vessels helping stabilize the pier became unmoored in choppy waters and bad weather over the weekend, which broke off part of the pier's support system. Two of the vessels floated north and landed on a beach in Ashdod, Israel. The two other vessels were anchored to the beach near the pier.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the pier as a signature project of his administration during the 2024 State of the Union (SOTU) in March.\n\n\"A temporary pier will enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day,\" Biden said during his remarks at the SOTU.\n\nMore broadly, the pier itself can only play a small role in delivering the aid needed in Gaza, even when fully operational. The Biden administration hopes to deliver 90 trucks worth of aid to Gaza per day via the JLOTS pier in the interim, eventually up to 150 trucks once initial problems are smoothed over. But 300 to 500 trucks of aid per day is required to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the millions of Palestinians who have been displaced by the ongoing Israel-Hamas war; the majority of the aid is being delivered by truck convoys through border crossings in Israel and Egypt.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

What we know", "body": "A floating pier on the shores of the Gaza Strip, set up to provide a lifeline to the Palestinian territory, has faced a rocky start, with one report claiming that it was \"sinking.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced the project in March to help transport supplies to the territory, which has been hit by Israel's bombardment, as it fights a war against Hamas prompted by the militant group's surprise October 7 attack on southern Israel.\n\nAmid international calls for the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow more humanitarian assistance into the territory, aid groups have started using the pier to distribute aid, but use of the facility has not gone smoothly.\n\nThe construction of the floating pier and its causeway, or Trident section, anchored to the Gaza shore adjacent to the north of the Netzarim corridor, was completed May 10.\n\nTwo months earlier, Biden announced the pier with the hope of averting famine in northern Gaza by providing seaborne access for assistance, as calls grew for Israel to ease access for relief supplies into the territory via land routes.\n\nThe Pentagon said the project involved about 1,000 U.S. service members, mostly from the Army and Navy. One U.S. defense official told Reuters the cost had risen to $320 million -- double the original estimate from earlier this year.\n\nThis caused concern among some, such as Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), the top Republican on the Democratic-led Senate Armed Services Committee, who told the agency the cost had \"exploded\" and was a \"dangerous effort with marginal benefit.\"\n\nVideo posted on social media by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) on Monday showed the American pier \"sinking in the water,\" The Jewish Press reported, although it is unclear how much of the structure, which was bobbing up and down, was under water. The soldier who shot the video is overheard saying: \"This is what happens when you help the enemy,\" the outlet said.\n\nColumnist and author Caroline Glick posted on X an image of the pier with the message: \"The Biden pier in Gaza is sinking into the sea....($320m sinking along with it...)\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the images were linked to an incident on Saturday in which four American vessels connected to the floating pier disconnected from the jetty due to stormy seas. U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, said the vessels had broken free from their moorings, leading them to get stuck on the coast.\n\nOne ship was stuck on a beach at the southern end of Ashdod, while another sent to extract it also got beached. The two other vessels were washed up on a beach near the pier, according to CENTCOM, which added the Israeli Navy helped with their recovery and that no one had been injured in the incidents.\n\nBut other problems have beset the pier, with Sabrina Singh, deputy Pentagon press secretary, saying last month that bad sea and weather conditions had delayed the delivery of the components for the construction.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of United States Central Command, told reporters last week that deliveries from the pier to warehouses inside Gaza had been initially hindered by a Hamas drone attack on the IDF and some aid trucks were looted en route, CNN reported.\n\nHowever, more than 500 metric tons of aid offloaded at the pier has been handed off to humanitarian partners, two-thirds of which is in the process of reaching those in need, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said last week, according to CNN.\n\nNewsweek has contacted USAID, CENTCOM and the Israeli foreign ministry for comment.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_cole@newsweek.com",

Palestinian terrorists on Wednesday attacked the U.S. pier being constructed off the coast of Gaza, the Israeli TV channel i24NEWS reported.\n\nGaza \"terrorists launched mortars at the maritime construction site, damaging several pieces of engineering equipment,\" the TV channel revealed. \" In addition, one person was slightly injured while running to a protected area.\"\n\nThe U.S. military is involved in the construction of the floating dock. It is unclear if American servicemen or civilian contractors were present at the site during the terrorist attack.\n\nThis is not the first time Palestinian terrorists have targeted humanitarian efforts to help the Gazans. In the past, Hamas terrorists have used delivery of food supplies to ambush Israeli troops. Terrorists have repeatedly attacked IDF soldiers, assisting civilians to evacuate the combat zones.\n\nAgain, totally predictable.\n\nThird, three American servicemen were recently injured, one of them critically, off the coast of Gaza working to get supplies to the pier: U.S. Soldier Critically Injured During Gaza Pier Operation, 2 Other Service Members Hurt:\n\nA U.S. soldier assigned to the Gaza pier mission was seriously injured on Thursday and medically evacuated to Israel, two defense officials confirmed to USNI News.\n\nThe soldier was working on the staging platform two miles off the coast of Gaza, where trucks filled with aid packages are driven from cargo ships onto Army watercraft, the defense officials told USNI News. At the time of the injury, the roll-on roll-off cargo ship MV Benevides was attached to the platform.\n\nVice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, told reporters on Thursday that a total of three service members were injured in non-combat-related incidents at sea.\n\n\"Three injuries, two were very minor injuries and those individuals returned to duty. One individual is undergoing care at a local Israeli hospital,\" Cooper told reporters during a Thursday Pentagon briefing.\n\nTypical Biden spokesperson minimizing extremely serious injuries a U.S. soldier.\n\nFourth, there are conflicting reports about whether any aid has yet to reach Palestinian civilians at all, From the Gray Lady last week: No Gaza Aid Delivered Through U.S.-Built Pier Has Been Distributed, Pentagon Says:\n\nFifth, bad, but not very bad, weather has caused a small Army tug boat transporting a portion of the pier to Ashkelon, Israel for safe harbor to run aground. A larger Army vessel sent to pull the tug off the beach also ran aground, as have two other small Army tugs near the Gaza pier: Four US vessels run aground near Gaza pier:\n\nHeavy seas battered the US maritime humanitarian mission to Gaza on Saturday, US Central Command (Centcom) said, with four vessels serving a floating aid delivery pier breaking free from their moorings....\n\nTwo of the affected vessels were now anchored on the beach near the pier and the other two were beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon, Centcom said, adding that efforts to recover the vessels were under way with assistance from the Israeli navy.\n\nHere is some good video and photo evidence of this disaster, off the coast of Ashdod, Israel, which is just north of Ashkelon:\n\nThanks to the Israelis for helping us avert total disaster.\n\nThe mainstream, legacy media has been mostly silent, as Kurt Schlichter noticed:\n\nFor me, the most disturbing part of the whole affair is how benign the weather was that caused this debacle.\n\nFrom the Jerusalem Post: US ship pulls landing craft off Ashdod beach:\n\nA US landing craft that became beached on the Ashdod shore was freed from the sand, a US military official told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.\n\nThe LCM 8558 landing craft has been working with a US-built floating pier off the coast. It was beached on Saturday after seeking to help free a US army tug that was helping move the floating pier from an area off the Gaza coast to near Ashdod due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe army tug resembles a flat section of the floating pier, so it was initially mistaken for a part of the floating pier.\n\nSo how \"adverse\" were the weather conditions?\n\nThe US was moving the floating pier toward an area near Ashdod because of the high swells that emerged on Thursday and Friday. The swells were around 1.5 meters, and winds gusted to some 20 knots.\n\nThese higher seas and waves apparently necessitated moving the pier. It is also not the first time the pier has been affected by weather conditions. When it was first constructed near Ashdod, it had to wait to be deployed because of turbulent waters.\n\n[emphasis added]\n\nThis has to be a joke. Wind that \"gusts\" to 20 mph or so, meaning that the sustained winds were probably 10-15 mph, was so \"severe\" that parts of the pier had to be moved to Israel and four Army boats ran aground????\n\nI know I was/am a submarine guy, but we routinely, while on deployment in the North Atlantic, and other places ;), prayed for weather this benign anytime we were near the surface. This is basically like weather slightly worse than what you find at the beach. And if Biden's $300+ million Gaza pier and supporting vessels can't take swells 4.5 feet, i.e. up to your chest, high, pardon my French, but who designed and is running this piece of crap???\n\nThis old operational planner has one bit of advice to Congress in their role of having oversight of the Executive Branch; subpoena the Decision Brief for the Gaza pier operation.\n\nThis was on the lowest of low scale of military operations, Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Response. There is little to nothing classified about any of this rump of a capability. Call in member of the Joint Staff who were involved in this planning - and I would prefer if you could find a few terminal O5/6 to testify as well. You might actually enjoy some candor.\n\nThe Commander's Intent, the Higher Direction and Guidance, the Planning Assumptions, the Constraints and Restraints, the Critical Vulnerability analysis, etc. It is all there. If not, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense should tell the American people to their face.\n\nThis is a larger issue than anything happening in that impossible corner of the globe. Over the weekend, we saw yet more indications of an empire in decline deteriorating from bad to pathetic.\n\nFrom the time the first load came off the pier, the aid barely made it past 300 meters until it disappeared into Hamasistan.\n\nAnd now, finally, the worst news of all, from, amazingly enough, CNN: US pier constructed off Gaza has broken apart:\n\nThe temporary pier constructed by the US military to transport aid into Gaza broke apart in heavy seas on Sunday in a major blow to the American-led effort to create a maritime corridor for humanitarian supplies into the war-torn enclave, according to four US officials.\n\nPart of the pier, which consists of a narrow causeway to drive aid into Gaza and a wider parking area to drop off supplies transported by ship, disconnected on Sunday, the officials said. The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe setback came one day after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\nThe effort to reassemble the causeway and connect it once again to the parking area will resume when sea conditions allow, officials said.\n\nThe pier, which cost $320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nAnd now we get even more detail on the weather capabilities of this temporary pier system:\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nAre you kidding me???????? Max of 3-foot waves???? Hahahahaha. This is just stupid.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_nault@legalinsurrection.com",

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nAlong with the beachings of the Army boats, the storm also battered and broke apart the aid pier -- a Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, or JLOTS, operation by the Army -- leaving the future of the key US humanitarian effort uncertain. The pier was set up to move hundreds of metric tons of aid to the area amid a brutal, months-long Israeli offensive against Hamas.\n\nThe boat groundings and destruction are the latest trouble for the pier and could disrupt the US effort for at least a week, according to the Pentagon.\n\n\"The Israeli navy will be helping push those vessels back, and hopefully they'll be fully operational,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Tuesday, noting that one ship should be recovered in the next day and the other two in the next 48 hours.\n\nMinutes after the briefing concluded, a defense official told Military.com that \"all service members have been removed from the beached vessels.\"\n\nIn addition to the storms beaching the four boats that were holding the aid pier in place, Singh confirmed that \"a portion of the Trident pier separated from the pier that is currently anchored into the coast of Gaza\" and \"the Trident pier was damaged.\"\n\nVideo of the section of pier, broken off and floating in the water, was posted to social media Monday.\n\nSingh said the broken section was eventually recovered and that the pier will be completely removed from its location in Gaza in the next 48 hours to be towed back to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs.\n\nRebuilding and repairs will take \"at least over a week,\" according to Singh.\n\nThe Pentagon spokeswoman said that the military's intention is to repair and eventually re-anchor the temporary pier to the coast and \"resume humanitarian aid to the people who need it most.\"\n\nSingh said that the dramatic halt to the aid mission and beaching of the ships were the result of a \"unique, unfortunate pattern of events with high seas and another storm that came in\" and rendered the pier inoperable.\n\nHowever, this is also not the first hurdle that the aid mission has encountered since it was announced by President Joe Biden during his State of the Union speech months ago.\n\nIn April, one of the ships set to carry supplies for the mission was forced to turn back to port after experiencing a fire in its engine room. Ship trackers and maritime experts also noted that one of the Army ships seemed to get stuck in Tenerife -- a small island that is part of the Canary Islands cluster off the west coast of Africa -- leading to speculation and concerns about more breakdowns.\n\nIn late April, a mortar attack hit the shoreline near the pier's eventual location but caused \"minimal damage.\" Then, as troops readied the pier for installation, high seas caused delays.\n\nEven once the pier was up and running, snags and problems continued to crop up.\n\nLast week, Pentagon officials conceded that some of the first truckloads of aid were not making it to the Palestinians but rather into the hands of looters. Reporters also found that Israeli settlers have taken to attacking aid shipments at border crossings, and some aid groups have accused Israeli security forces of tipping off settlers to aid convoy routes -- in turn, allowing them to attack or block them.\n\nOn Tuesday, Singh was adamant that, despite setbacks and problems, the mission is valuable and the Pentagon is determined to see it through.\n\n\"You have men and women out there, separated from their families ... who are putting others first to try and be part of a lifesaving mission that has seen over 1,000 metric tons of aid come in,\" Singh said.\n\n\"So, hopefully, when we are able to re-anchor the pier back in, you'll be able to see that aid flow off in a pretty steady stream,\" she added.", "source": {"uri":

Just two weeks after it opened, the pier's operations have been temporarily suspended and repairs could take more than a week. President Biden announced the project in March and White House touted it as a c ritical tool to get relief to the war-torn population.\n\nThe Biden administration had announced the pier as at least a temporary solution to reports of mass suffering and starvation in Gaza . With an estimated $320 million price tag, it provides a way to bring in relief from Cyprus even as Israel resists U.S. pressure to open more land routes for delivery of supplies.\n\nNow, it is set to be towed to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod for repairs which could take 'at least over a week,' Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe Pentagon blames rough seas for the problems with the pier. U.S. Central Command said choppy conditions caused four U.S. vessels to break free of the pier. Two of them washed up on shore in Gaza.\n\nFootage from land shows the rusted hull of a U.S. Army ship that had been beached amid efforts to free it. Two other vessels are anchored off the beach. As Singh described it, the Trident pier, which has been anchored to the beach at Rafa, must be removed in order to be worked on.\n\n'Think of that Trident pier as having like a large tee. That top part of the tee disconnected, so that has been recovered. But in order to reassemble everything it's going to to detach from the coastline move up to Ashdod to be reassembled and then reattached - re-anchored back,' she said.\n\nSingh said the pier had handled about 1,000 metric tons (over 2,000 pounds) of aid had been delivered on the pier before it went offline. The Pentagon says about 1,000 service members were involved in the project.\n\nWhite House National Security Spokesman John Kirby, who marked the opening of the pier with a series of TV interviews earlier this month , has said there would be no U.S. boots on the ground in Israel but that U.S. forces would provide security for the pier.\n\nIsraeli journalist Caroline Glick posted an image Monday with commentary about the situation, writing that the pier was 'sinking' amid the rough seas.

Two washed up on the southern Israel coast near the city of Ashdod, and the other beached in Gaza.\n\nIn addition, a member of the U.S. military is in critical condition in Israel after having suffered non-combat injuries last week on the pier, with two other service members receiving minor injuries on the pier, known as a Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) structure.\n\nMeanwhile, there are some reports that the floating pier system, placed to transport humanitarian aid to the Gaza territory in hopes of averting a famine in the region amidst the Israel-Hamas war, may even be \"sinking,\" reports Newsweek.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces posted a video Monday showing that the pier is \"sinking in the water,\" with a soldier shooting the video commenting that \"this is what happens when you help the enemy.\"\n\nColumnist and author Caroline Glick also posted a picture of the pier on X and commented that \"The Biden pier in Gaza is sinking into the sea....($320m sinking along with it...).\"\n\nAlready, the pier's $320 million price tag is double its original estimate, and Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, commented that the pier was a \"dangerous effort with marginal benefit.\"\n\nIt was not clear if the images were linked to the U.S. ships being disconnected from the pier Saturday, notes Newsweek.\n\nU.S. Central Command Deputy Commander Vice Admiral Brad Coopers said last week that deliveries from the pier into Gazan warehouses were hindered after Hamas set a drone attack against the IDF, and also because some of the aid trucks were looted while transporting goods.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development said last week that more than 500 metric tons of aid were offloaded.\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general

Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy.\"\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces is supporting the recovery efforts near the pier and no U.S. personnel will enter Gaza, CENTCOM said. No injuries were reported, and the pier remained fully functional.\n\nU.S. soldiers reportedly were forced to go ashore in Israel on the beach near Ashdod, just north of Ashkelon, to free the vessels. President Joe Biden promised in his State of the Union address in March that there would be no \"boots on the ground\" to support the pier.\n\nIt's the latest setback in what has not been a smooth effort to deliver humanitarian aid to Palestinian civilians caught in Israel's military operation against Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists. The flow of aid was temporarily interrupted when delivery trucks were overrun, resulting in the death of at least one person.\n\nA U.S. soldier was critically wounded, and two other soldiers were injured on a staging platform two miles off the coast of Gaza being used to transfer aid from the cargo ship MV Roy P. Benavidez to a smaller U.S. Army watercraft moving the aid to the Gaza shoreline.\n\nOne of the craft that was beached on the shore of Ashdod on Saturday was freed from the sand, The Jerusalem Post reported Sunday, citing a U.S. military official.\n\nThe U.S. Army LCM 8558 landing craft was beached after trying to free a U.S. Army tugboat that was helping to move the floating pier from an area off the Gaza coast to near Ashdod because of adverse weather conditions, the Post reported.\n\nThe USAV Matamoros, a larger U.S. Army landing craft, came to aid the LCM 8558 on Saturday afternoon, the Post reported. It took time to connect a rope from the Matamoros to the LCM, but by midday Sunday, a rope was attached, and the LCM was ready to be pulled off the shore.\n\nThe tide remained an issue because low tide was about 6 p.m. local time. At about 9 p.m., a U.S. military official told the Post the LCM was pulled off the beach with the hope that it would remain free of the sand. The goal would then be to take the tug off the beach. Then, the vessels will all be united with the floating pier and likely return to the coast of Gaza so humanitarian aid can be delivered again.\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax

The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe setback came one day after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\nThe effort to reassemble the causeway and connect it once again to the parking area will resume when sea conditions allow, officials said.\n\nThe pier, which cost $320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nThe US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tons of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population.\n\nDaniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID's Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \"thousands and thousands of tons\" of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oren_liebermann@cnn.com", "name": "Oren Liebermann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "natasha_bertrand@cnn.com", "name": "Natasha Bertrand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Ashdod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of Ashdod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Distribution_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Distribution and Logistics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2152813836.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1235, "textEnd": 1241}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 1314, "textEnd": 1320}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The choppy waters caused the motorized pier sections that were used to stabilize the Trident Pier to break free from their anchors due to a loss in power; they were subsequently washed ashore in Israel.\n\n\"As of today one of the Army vessels that was beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon has been recovered. The second vessel that was also beached near Ashkelon will be recovered in the next 24 hours, and the remaining two vessels that were beached near the Trident Pier are expected to be recovered in the next 48 hours,\" Pentagon deputy spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday in a briefing.\n\n\"Efforts to recover the vessels are underway with the assistance from the Israeli Navy.\"\n\nEarlier in the day on Tuesday, high seas in combination with a North African weather system caused one of the pier sections to separate from the part of the pier that is currently anchored to the Gaza coast.\n\nThe pier is comprised of two main components: a large floating dock made up of steel segments and a two-lane, 1,800 foot (548 meter) causeway and pier. The causeway that leads to the shore and connects to the floating dock is composed of a series of interconnected, 40 foot (12 meter) steel pieces linked together and attached to shore.\n\n\"Sections of the pier need rebuilding and repairing,\" Singh told reporters. \"Therefore, over the next 48 hours the Trident Pier will be removed from its anchored position on the coast and towed back to Ashdod where US Central Command (CENTCOM) will conduct repairs.\"\n\nThe rebuilding and repairing of the pier is expected to take more than a week; following its completion, it will need to be re-anchored to the coast of Gaza, she said.\n\nSingh contends that the pier has proved \"highly valuable\" in delivering aid to Gaza civilians. She told reporters that the pier will be reassembled and re-anchored to the Gaza coast in order to resume delivery of humanitarian aid via the maritime corridor.\n\nHow Much Aid Entered Gaza via the Pier?\n\nHumanitarian aid was delivered to the Gaza shore via the new pier for the first time on May 18. In the 10 days since (actually a week due to the pier breaking apart), more than 1,000 metric tons were delivered from the pier to the marshalling area for onward delivery by humanitarian organizations to Gazans, according to the Pentagon.\n\nEach pallet of aid weighs about a ton, according to the Cypriot Foreign Ministry. About 40 percent of the aid that reached the marshalling area subsequently reached its intended destination. The rest was intercepted and hijacked by Hamas-led terrorists and gang members.\n\nBut the amount of aid arriving via the pier is not yet significant.\n\nTo put things in perspective: on Monday (May 27) alone, more than 370 humanitarian aid trucks entered Gaza, including 154 trucks arriving via the Kerem Shalom Crossing from Egypt. More than 70 trucks carrying flour from the World Food Program (WFP) entered the enclave from the Ashdod Port.\n\nOne day earlier, 360 trucks entered Gaza with aid for the residents, including 124 aid trucks that entered via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. In addition, 37 pallets of aid were air dropped over Gaza, and six tankers filled with fuel entered as well.\n\nLast week, 1,981 trucks entered Gaza, including 242 trucks carrying humanitarian aid from Jordan.\n\n\"Israel has facilitated the entry of half a million tons of humanitarian aid into Gaza, including almost 20,000 trucks of food,\" according to COGAT (Israel's liaison with Palestinian Authority and Gaza citizens).\n\nEighty percent more food is being delivered to the enclave via land, sea and air, than had been prior to the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, Israeli government spokesperson Tal Heinrich told reporters at a briefing on Tuesday.\n\nStudy: Gazans Are Getting Enough Food\n\nSince the beginning of the war, a total of more than 30,500 trucks have delivered more 591,000 tons of humanitarian aid into Gaza, with Israel opening new crossings, fixing the enclave's water pipes and paving roads to make the deliveries more efficient -- all while Hamas terrorists continue bombing the crossings, damaging the water pipes and hijacking the aid from the trucks to feed its terrorists and sell the rest at exorbitant prices in the Gaza marketplaces.\n\nNevertheless, according to a study by Israeli health and medical personnel that analyzed food shipments delivered into the Gaza Strip by land from January to April 2024 as recorded by COGAT, a sufficient amount of food and other supplies are entering the enclave to meet the needs of the entire population.\n\nThe study, conducted from January to April 2024, estimated the total calories, protein, fat and iron content of each shipment according to food composition values, analyzing data from 14,916 trucks weighing 227, 853.8 tons of food items as recorded by COGAT.\n\n\"Additional sources of food aid provided by air, sea and via the Egyptian border were not taken into account,\" the report noted. \"Therefore, our results do not represent the entire food supply available to the population, which may have more fruit and vegetables.\"\n\nOn average, 3,729 food trucks entered Gaza per month (124 per day) -- more food trucks entering the enclave daily than before the war.\n\n\"The amount of food delivered per capita should be sufficient for the entire Gazan population, and meets Sphere humanitarian recommendations for food aid delivery to conflict affected populations, during the period examined,\" the researchers concluded.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

CENTCOM added that the Israel Defense Forces were assisting in the recovery efforts and that no U.S. personnel would enter the Gaza Strip.\n\nAid had just begun to flow into Gaza through the pier last week after several days of logistical delays. Construction of the floating pier began late last month under the Biden administration's directive to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as Israel has been accused of placing barriers on the delivery of aid to Palestinians in need.\n\nThe continued problems with the pier come just a day after the International Court of Justice called on Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah and reopen the border crossing with Egypt to resume the flow of aid into Gaza. Israel has said it does not recognize the ICJ's authority, and while its rulings are legally binding, the ICJ itself has no enforcement powers. Also yesterday, in a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi agreed to restart aid truck deliveries into Rafah and to allow the flow of humanitarian assistance through the Kerem Shalom crossing \"on a provisional basis.\"\n\nRead more: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/25/us-aid-gaza-pier-disrupted-00160020", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Egypt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Gen. Pat Ryder, who serves as Pentagon press secretary, confirmed the aid delay in a statement to reporters Tuesday.\n\nApproximately 1,000 U.S. troops participated in the pier construction efforts.

The parking area will have to be reconnected to the causeway before the pier can be used again.\n\nThe setback came one day after heavy seas forced two small US Army vessels to beach in Israel, according to US Central Command, while another two vessels broke free of their moorings and were anchored near the pier.\n\nThe effort to reassemble the causeway and connect it once again to the parking area will resume when sea conditions allow, officials said.\n\nThe pier, which cost $320 million, had only begun operating on May 17 when heavy seas forced the maritime shipments to stop one week later on May 24, two days before part of the pier disconnected. It is unclear when shipments will resume.\n\nThe temporary pier, called the Joint Logistics Over the Shore (JLOTS), requires very good sea conditions to operate. CNN reported previously that JLOTS can only be operated safely in a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour.\n\nHeavier sea conditions delayed the deployment of the pier for several weeks, as the system sat docked in the Israeli port of Ashdod waiting for favorable conditions.\n\nThe US has stressed that the temporary pier is only meant to augment humanitarian shipments going through the land crossings between Israel and Gaza.\n\nOn Thursday, Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, said 820 metric tons of aid had been delivered through the pier to the Gaza beach, where the United Nations was responsible for distributing it to the Palestinian population.\n\nDaniel Dieckhaus, the director of USAID's Levant Response Management Team, told reporters Thursday that there were \"thousands and thousands of tons\" of aid waiting in Cyprus to be delivered through the maritime corridor. But those shipments are now paused with the temporary pier inoperable.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

US Central Command said on Saturday that \"heavy sea states\" had dislodged four US Army vessels from their moorings, but that the pier itself remained \"fully functional.\"\n\n\"The vessels broke free from their moorings and two vessels are now anchored on the beach near the pier. The third and fourth vessels are beached on the coast of Israel near Ashkelon. Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy,\" CENTCOM's statement read.\n\nWhy it matters: Northern Gaza is facing \"full-blown famine,\" the head of the United Nations' World Food Program said on May 6, though experts say the effects are likely spread throughout the Palestinian enclave.\n\nUSAID initially estimated the pier would enable the delivery of some 290 metric tons of international humanitarian aid per day before logistics were fully up and running, eventually potentially reaching some 430 to 750 metric tons per day.\n\nAfter more than a week of delays that US officials attributed to high sea swells, the pier was installed earlier this month. But initial deliveries fell far short of the US government's projections, and distribution was impeded last week after people overran a number of aid trucks leaving the onshore distribution facility controlled by the Israeli military.\n\nBiden administration officials have repeatedly pressed Israeli leaders, and more recently Egyptian officials, to ensure the flow of cross-border humanitarian aid into Gaza, saying the pier is meant to augment, not replace, the overland shipment of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe context: US President Joe Biden authorized the military in March to construct the pier on Gaza's coast in order to surge international humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave in a bid to stave off looming famine.\n\nThe Biden administration has resisted calls to directly pressure Israeli leaders to halt the war, instead pushing for renewed rounds of cease-fire to persuade Hamas to release the hostages and Israeli leaders to pause their campaign.\n\nThe talks have so far failed to prevent an Israeli military invasion of Rafah, despite Biden saying in March that this would be a \"red line\" for his administration.\n\nThe US administration withheld a single shipment of 2,000-pound and 500-pound air-to-ground munitions to Israel last month, a symbolic gesture amid continued US approvals for future arms transfers. The White House signaled that additional arms shipments were already under review and would be withheld if Israel launched a major operation into Rafah's population centers.\n\nThe Israeli military began encircling Rafah in early May.

Gen. Patrick Ryder also told reporters last week that he did not believe any of the aid transferred via the pier had reached people in Gaza.\n\n\"It is not flowing at a rate that any of us are happy with,\" he was quoted as saying, admitting to the failure of the much-hyped project.\n\nAsal Rad, a US-based pro-Palestine activist who holds a PhD in West Asia history, wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Sunday that the pier was a \"predictable disaster.\"\n\n\"Israel is deliberately starving people and the US is putting on a show to pretend that's not happening,\" she stated, calling out the American hypocrisy.\n\nMedea Benjamin, a political activist and co-founder of the anti-war group CodePink, also slammed the initiative, calling on the US authorities to force the Israeli regime to open the Rafah crossing \"instead of wasting our tax money on such projects.\"\n\nHumanitarian operations 'nearing collapse'\n\nOn Friday, the UN said it had received the equivalent of 97 trucks of humanitarian supplies through the floating dock since it came into operation, which means that the pier capacity remains far below the 150 trucks a day that officials had hoped for.\n\nMeanwhile, aid groups say Gaza needs a total of 600 trucks a day to meet its colossal humanitarian needs.\n\nThe UN keeps maintaining that land deliveries are the \"most viable, effective, and efficient\" way to address the growing humanitarian crisis in the narrow strip, where nearly 36,000 people have been killed since the genocidal war was launched on October 7, 2023.\n\nOn May 6, defying international warnings, Israel pressed on with its assault on Gaza's southern city of Rafah and seized control of its border crossing, cutting off a vital route for humanitarian aid and potential sanctuary for thousands of civilians from a building offensive.\n\nLast week on Tuesday, the UN announced it had suspended food distribution in Rafah due to a lack of supplies and insecurity caused by Israel's expanding military offensive, warning that humanitarian operations across the territory were nearing collapse.\n\nIt also warned that the pier project may fail unless Israel starts providing the conditions humanitarian groups need to operate safely.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday night, days after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) again called on the Israeli regime to immediately halt its offensive in Rafah, more than 30 Palestinians were massacred there.\n\n'No meaningful impact'\n\nCraig Mokhiber, a former top UN human rights official who resigned last year, in a post on X said the pier had \"failed to have any meaningful impact\" while \"Israel continues to block aid at all crossing points.\"\n\nHe described it as a \"fig leaf to cover US complicity in genocide and the destruction of UNRWA.\"\n\nUNRWA, formally known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, is the main agency in Gaza providing humanitarian aid and social services -- critical at a time when there are dire shortages of food, water and sanitary conditions because of Israel's genocidal war against the besieged territory.\n\nIsrael's attempts to dismantle UNRWA go back many years, however, since the regime began its new war against Gaza on October 7, it has also doubled its effort to target the aid agency by framing its workers as complicit in Hamas' Operation Al-Aqsa Storm into the occupied territories.\n\nDespite no evidence to back up those claims, several Western countries, led by the US, suspended their funding to the largest humanitarian relief body in Gaza.\n\nThis comes as according to the World Food Programme, about half of the total population of Gaza -- roughly 1.1 million Palestinians -- are at catastrophic levels of hunger, especially in northern Gaza, where fears of a famine have been strongest.\n\nThe Geneva-based Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor said in a statement on Sunday that famine must be declared in the Gaza Strip \"due to Israel's insistence on committing the crime of starvation and using it as a weapon of war against the Palestinian people in the Strip, which is part of a larger crime of genocide.\"\n\nFood aid for Gaza rotting\n\nMedia reports on Friday revealed that some of the food supplies waiting to enter Gaza from Egypt have begun to rot as the Rafah border crossing remains shut to aid deliveries for a third week after Israel began its assault on Gaza's southern city.\n\nMahmoud Hussein, a truck driver, was quoted by media as saying that his goods that had been loaded on his vehicle for a month were gradually spoiling in the sun. Some of the foodstuffs are being discarded, others are sold at cheap rates.\n\n\"Apples, bananas, chicken and cheese, a lot of things have gone rotten, some stuff has been returned and is being sold for a quarter of its price,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say that the onions we're carrying will at best be eaten by animals because of the worms in them.\"\n\nAccording to UN data, just over 900 truckloads have entered Gaza in total since May 7.\n\nA UN document seen by media also shows that as of May 16, more than 2,000 UN and international NGO trucks were waiting to enter Gaza, including 1,574 carrying food supplies.\n\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, director of the Gaza government media office, has said that many of the goods that enter the Gaza Strip are \"unfit\" for human use and are \"unhealthy.\"\n\nSettlers attack Gaza aid trucks\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli settlers keep attacking and vandalizing trucks delivering aid to Gaza and preventing humanitarian supplies from reaching the territory where people grapple with starvation.\n\nVideos emerged on social media showing Israeli settlers throwing boxes of much-needed supplies on the ground, stomping on them and setting ablaze the trucks.\n\nDespite international condemnation, footage of the incident clearly showed that Israeli regime troops did nothing to stop the attacks on aid convoys.\n\nLast week, the Guardian, quoting multiple sources, revealed that Israeli forces are tipping off settlers to the location of aid trucks delivering supplies to Gaza, enabling the groups to block and vandalize them.\n\nIsraeli war

The IDF has taken over the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing, which has typically been used for transporting aid throughout the conflict.\n\nEgypt closed its side of the border when Israel took control of the Gazan side of the crossing, and says it will not reopen it until Palestinians are granted control.\n\nHundreds of aid trucks traveled through Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing this weekend, but United Nations workers say they have had difficulty accessing the aid due to heavy fighting nearby.\n\nThe aid has become even more vital thanks to damage to the U.S.-built \"floating pier\" on Gaza's coast. Choppy seas detached four vessels that had been stabilizing the pier this weekend.\n\nUS MILITARY CONSTRUCTS HULKING METAL PIER AMID BIDEN'S $320 MILLION GAMBLE TO GET AID INTO GAZA\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTwo of the boats floated northward and landed on a beach in Ashdod, Israel, while the two others remain anchored at the beach near the pier, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBIDEN'S VISION FOR A PALESTINIAN STATE DOOMED, EXPERTS SAY: 'AN EXPLICIT RECOGNITION OF HAMAS'\n\n\"Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy,\" U.S. Central Command said.\n\nThe U.S. spent roughly $320 million constructing the pier, which has been a conduit for aid from the U.S. and other countries. While the pier has been used to transfer roughly 569 metric tons of aid into Gaza, none of that aid had been delivered to Palestinians as of last week, the Pentagon confirmed.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, who serves as Pentagon press secretary, confirmed the aid delay in a statement to reporters on Tuesday.\n\nRoughly 1,000 U.S. soldiers have been engaged in the effort to build the pier. Both the U.S. and Israel have emphasized that no U.S. troops have entered Gaza during the operation, but three U.S. troops were injured in accidents during operations on the pier over the past week.\n\nGROWING CONTROVERSY OVER BIDEN'S GAZA PIER FUELS CONCERNS OVER COST, SECURITY\n\nThe U.S. says the pier remains mostly operational despite the damage sustained this weekend. The Israeli navy is assisting in efforts to recover the two vessels that washed ashore in Ashdod, the Journal reported.\n\nOriginal article source: Aid starts entering Gaza through land after US 'floating pier' damaged by weather", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anders_hagstrom@aol.com", "name": "Anders Hagstrom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah_Border_Crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah Border Crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerem_Shalom_border_crossing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerem Shalom border crossing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Disabilities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Aid_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Aid Climbing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/jQHrAmANjilA9bApX3stWQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_fox_news_text_745/f16def4fb6f9773b1bdfbdb1c795c0e2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

On top of everything else, it also puts U.S. boots on the ground (despite the denial of the Biden administration) and puts them in harm's way.\n\nThe pier has faced mortar barrage. Three service members involved in operations were injured in a non-combat related accident, one critically injured. Then the Pentagon spokesperson informed us last week that no aid from the pier had actually reached the people it was supposed to in Gaza. Then, on top of all that, the weather was causing trouble, the pier was damaged, and ships were running aground, so they were having to put \"boots on the ground\" in the most humiliating way possible, as my colleague Streiff explained. Oh, and let's not forget about the aid being swiped by Hamas.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nUS Army Finally Has 'Boots on the Ground' in Gaza in the Most Humiliating Way Possible\n\nThree US Servicemembers Have Non-Combat Injuries in Gaza; on the Other Hand, No Aid Is Getting Through\n\nNow comes the latest story in the drama. Townhall's John Hasson sums up the saga as pier operations are being suspended after a \"piece breaks off.\"\n\nThey're also going to remove the pier to repair it.\n\nOver the next two days, the pier will be pulled out and sent to the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, where U.S. Central Command will repair it, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters. She said the fixes will take \"at least over a week\" and then the pier will need to be anchored back into the beach in Gaza.\n\nOnce again, we have another expensive, embarrassing Biden failure. It's the perfect metaphor for his whole approach -- sinking and underwater. How is \"Build Back Better\" going?\n\nSo I have a question. What will prevent the same thing from happening again when they put it back? If they had taken any time to consider the matter, this would have been completely predictable.\n\nAnd how is any of this a good plan to further involve the U.S. here because Joe Biden wants to appeal to Michigan for their votes? The problem is the whole idea -- a waste of our money in an effort to help Joe Biden's political fortunes.\n\nBut the Biden team is going to continue learning nothing.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_arama@redstate.com", "name": "Nick Arama", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortar (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_Back_Better_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Build Back Better Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/124/8090b213-ef61-48c3-8718-1b4e4b8e423e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Two of the vessels ended up anchored along the beach near the causeway, and two others ended up on the beach by the Israeli city of Ashkelon. One of the vessels that wound up near Ashkelon has been recovered, while the other is expected to be recovered within the next day, Singh said. The other two will be recovered in the near future as well.\n\nAdditionally, a portion of the causeway \"separated from the pier\" that's anchored into the Gaza coast and resulted in damage, Singh said. The causeway, which is supposed to be anchored into the coast, will be detached, brought back to Ashdod, Israel, where it will be repaired, and then, it will have to be reinstalled.\n\n\"The trident here will be removed from its anchor position on the coast and towed back to Ashdod, where U.S. Central Command will conduct repairs,\" Singh said. \"The rebuilding and repairing of the pier will take at least over a week and, following completion, will need to be reanchored to the coast of Gaza.\"\n\nThe pier had been operational for only about two weeks, though in that time, they had been able to get more than 1,000 metric tons of aid into Gaza, she said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced in early March during his State of the Union address that he directed the military to build the pier to supplement, not replace, the humanitarian efforts throughout Gaza. Officials have said getting aid through the Gaza-Israeli land crossings has to be the primary method of getting aid into the enclave.\n\nCyprus plays a critical role in the international effort to get aid into Gaza via the pier.\n\nAid is screened and palletized in Cyprus, and it's then loaded on commercial or military vessels that will travel from there to the pier, which is in the Mediterranean Sea. The aid then gets transported to smaller U.S. military vessels before going to the causeway. These are the vessels that washed ashore.\n\nThe smaller ships can get closer to the coast than bigger ships. The aid is then unloaded and put onto trucks that will be driven down the causeway and unloaded for U.N. distribution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPentagon officials have not indicated a specific end date for the mission, though Vice Adm. Brad Cooper, the deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, recently told reporters that, historically, the weather conditions generally become less suitable for this mission by early September.\n\nAll of Gaza's 2.2 million residents are facing acute food insecurity, according to Sonali Korde, the assistant to the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development's Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brest@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mike Brest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Causeway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkelon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashkelon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cyprus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Agency_for_International_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Agency for International Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Immune_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Immune Disorders", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Health and Safety", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24137703490828.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The pier contained two elements, one of which was attached to the shore and the other of which was out at sea. The pier was constructed after US army vessels made a long month-and-a-half journey to Israel.Now CNN and Reuters are reporting that the pier has been badly impacted by heavy seas. CNN characterized this as \"broke apart.\" Reuters said that \"US officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said bad weather was believed to be the reason that part had broken off.They did not say how big the part was or speculate on how long it would take for the pier to resume operations.\" During the night of May 24 a tug that is part of the pier, and resembles the pier itself, washed ashore on Ashdod beach.\n\nOn May 25 a US LCM landing craft also became stuck on the beach trying to free the tug section. The landing craft was pulled off on the evening of May 26, but the tug remained in the sand. It is not clear if it has been freed. Then a short video appeared on May 27 claiming to show the pier had \"sunk\" off the coast of Gaza. It showed a section apparently moored off the coast, but the other sections that were anchored to the coast missing.I have followed the story of the pier closely. Four US army ships left in mid-March from Ft. Eustis. These included the USAV James A. Loux, USAV Montorrey, USAV Matamoros and USAV Wilson Wharf.\n\nBy April 17 the ships were in Crete in Souda Bay at a naval base. By this time, they included the USAV Matamoros, USAV James A. Loux, USAV Montorrey, and USAV General Frank S. Besson Jr. The USAV Wilson's Wharf had stayed behind off the coast of West Africa. It wasn't the only ship to turn back, apparently. Another ship did as well. On May 15 US Central Command said that the pier could begin operations within days.\n\nSigns of problems in the operation\n\nHowever, there were already signs of problems in this operation. The pier had been put together off the coast of Ashdod. The pier floats and it is composed of modular sections. The way it is intended to work is that you put the sections together and then tug boats can move it to a place where it can be moored or anchored.Then cargo ships deliver cargo to the floating pier. The cargo can then be put on the ships like USAV Matamoros and moved to shore or moved to the section of the floating pier that is attached to the shore. The pallets that arrive by cargo ship to the floating pier can be put on trucks that then roll on and off the boats like the Matamoros, and drive ashore on the floating pier. It's an incredibly complex operation.The ships are part of the US Army's 7th Transportation Brigade of the 18th Airborne Corps. Back in March US Central Command said the ships \"from the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, XVIII Airborne Corps, departed Joint Base Langley-Eustis en route to the Eastern Mediterranean to establish a roll-on, roll-off dock capability that allows the ship to shore humanitarian assistance to Gaza. SP4 James A. Loux, Monterrey, Matamoros, and Wilson's Wharf are carrying equipment and supplies needed to establish a temporary pier to deliver vital humanitarian supplies.\"The story here is that, like any military operation, complexity always makes things difficult. There were a lot of variables here. They had to attach a section to the land near the Netzarim corridor, an IDF controlled area south of Gaza city. That section had to be defended as well. The US put a C-RAM system on the floating pier. The system can shoot down mortars and other threats. The US didn't want boots on the ground, so the system sat on the floating section. The danger from shelling was only one problem.There was also the weather problem. Reports say that the pier was not designed to withstand a heavy sea, or in fact it seems any seas in which waves reached over 1.5 meters.On the coast of Israel and Gaza it is common for the waves to get up to 1 meter or 1.5 meters and for winds to gust sometimes at 20 knots. It seems that any time there was even a hint of a storm the planners didn't want the pier at sea, so it had to be towed back to an area off Ashdod on May 24. This means it was only operational for a short time.CENTCOM was proud of the work it did. It said that as of May 24, 903 metric tons of aid had been delivered from the beach to a UN warehouse. In addition some 1,005 metric tons had been delivered by CENTCOM from the sea to the beach, of which 184 tons arrived to the beach on May 23-24.\"The men and women of US Central Command are proud to support USAID in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Gaza. This corridor is a multinational and combined effort led by USAID and the Department of Defense - alongside the Republic of Cyprus, the United Nations, and international donors, including the UAE, the United Kingdom, Romania, and the European Union.\" Deliveries basically took place from May 17 to 24. Then the bad weather led to the current problems. Several voices see in the pier's problems a symbol of US failure during this war. These critics are dispersed across the political spectrum.You have people who oppose Israel and the US administration's support of Israel and think of the pier as symbolic of how the US cobbled together a bad operation to fix a humanitarian crisis that Israel caused. They have been cheering what they think is its demise. On the other hand there are also pro-Israel voices who think the Biden administration has made a wreck of its policy in the region, and that the pier is an example of this kind of incompetence.While the critics may have a point on the larger story, as they see it, the fact is that an operation like this pier was always going to be a complex logistical long-shot. It's not easy to take small ships across an ocean and then get to the coast of a country and construct a floating pier.The logistics here were very complex. Sections of the pier and the landing craft had to be transported, and a large number of ships brought in to manage this work.It may also show that the concept of a floating pier has inherent problems, because if the pier can't withstand a tough sea then it is always going to need to be moved around. What if the pier didn't have Ashdod port, and the coastline was more hostile? This is certainly a learning experience and the real story of the pier may now be that it comes down to learning how it actually can function.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Choppy seas detached four vessels that had been stabilizing the pier this weekend.\n\nUS MILITARY CONSTRUCTS HULKING METAL PIER AMID BIDEN'S $320 MILLION GAMBLE TO GET AID INTO GAZA\n\nTwo of the boats floated northward and landed on a beach in Ashdod, Israel, while the two others remain anchored at the beach near the pier, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBIDEN'S VISION FOR A PALESTINIAN STATE DOOMED, EXPERTS SAY: 'AN EXPLICIT RECOGNITION OF HAMAS'\n\n\"Efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy,\" U.S. Central Command said.\n\nThe U.S. spent roughly $320 million constructing the pier, which has been a conduit for aid from the U.S. and other countries. While the pier has been used to transfer roughly 569 metric tons of aid into Gaza, none of that aid had been delivered to Palestinians as of last week, the Pentagon confirmed.\n\nMaj. Gen. Pat Ryder, who serves as Pentagon press secretary, confirmed the aid delay in a statement to reporters on Tuesday.\n\nRoughly 1,000 U.S. soldiers have been engaged in the effort to build the pier. Both the U.S. and Israel have emphasized that no U.S. troops have entered Gaza during the operation, but three U.S. troops were injured in accidents during operations on the pier over the past week.\n\nGROWING CONTROVERSY OVER BIDEN'S GAZA PIER FUELS CONCERNS OVER COST, SECURITY\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. says the pier remains mostly operational despite the damage sustained this weekend.

Two of the ships were anchored near the Gaza Strip dock, while two other ships ran aground on Israeli shores.\n\n\"The IDF is supporting recovery efforts near the pier,\" officials said in a statement. \"No American personnel will enter Gaza. No injuries have been reported and the pier remains fully functional. We will release additional details as they become available.\n\nThe vessels appeared to be Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) Mark 8s, part of the watercraft unit that helped build and guide the pier.\n\nA section of the pier was also beached, which could be used to allow people to monitor construction and movements.\n\nThe USAV Matamoros, a ship the size of a football field, moved off Ashdod Beach, appearing to assist in rescue operations. At one point, Israeli forces attempted to use a small drone to deliver a rope to the Matamoros, but had to abandon their efforts when the rope got snagged in the waves.\n\nThe ship had left Fort Eustis, Virginia, in March, as part of the fleet sent to build the floating pier.\n\nThe crash landing of U.S. military ships on Israeli beaches underscored the challenge posed to the Biden administration's efforts to find alternative routes for delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged ship.\n\nThe U.S. ships landed in the southern Israeli city of Ashdod, about 20 miles from Gaza's northern border.\n\nThe force of the seas on Saturday, with swells of 1.6 meters and winds gusting between 10 and 20 knots, offered a concrete demonstration of how weather conditions can hamper what was already an extremely difficult route for the delivery of aid.\n\nThe ships are part of the Biden administration's $320 million pier project aimed at increasing humanitarian aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAid began trickling slowly from the dock last week, an extraordinary effort to deliver food to Palestinians facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis amid nearly eight months of war following Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on October 7.\n\nU.S. officials acknowledged that the pier's first days of operation fell short of the scale of supplies they hoped to deliver.\n\nAid workers and aid groups cited enormous challenges in delivering aid, with land crossings closed due to Israeli military operations, a lack of resources to deliver aid and manage its distribution, as well as death threats against humanitarian workers operating in a theater of conflict.\n\nThe news also comes after three U.S. soldiers assigned to the dock mission were injured earlier this week, according to the Pentagon, including one whose injuries were serious enough to require medical evacuation to Israel.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Most are forgettable alphabet salads only beloved by bureaucrats. But SNAFU is one of the greats, allegedly originating during WW II. The polite phrase is \"situation normal, all fouled up.\" But we know that the GIs actually used the F word. Quite a lot, in my experience.\n\nThe Biden administration's pitiful attempt at theatrics in an attempt to cover for the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza was its $360 million boondoggle, a Gaza aid pier, which I described as a Potemkin Village because of its lack of substantial substance.\n\nOn Saturday, three small navy support vessels for the pier were swept away by high seas, and two of them were driven onto shore, becoming beached. That's the kind of thing that gets a captain busted down to the ranks. A third ship was also washed away, but it was attached to a section of the pier and so they both went spinning off. The pier section seems to be heading for the Israeli port of Ashdod. I don't know where the third ship is, to which it had been attached. No naval personnel are said to have been injured, except for their pride.\n\nAlthough CENTCOM maintains that what remains of the pier is still functional, I don't know if that is really true. If this kind of thing happened within a week of its inauguration, can you really call that functional?\n\nSpeaking of Ashdod, that port city already has a harbor and the U.S. could have delivered aid there to be trucked down to Gaza much more efficiently. But let me guess.\n\nThe Israelis won't let us?

Quite a lot, in my experience.\n\nThe Biden administration's pitiful attempt at theatrics in an attempt to cover for the ongoing Israeli genocide in Gaza was its $360 million boondoggle, a Gaza aid pier, which I described as a Potemkin Village because of its lack of substantial substance.\n\nOn Saturday, three small navy support vessels for the pier were swept away by high seas, and two of them were driven onto shore, becoming beached. That's the kind of thing that gets a captain busted down to the ranks. A third ship was also washed away, but it was attached to a section of the pier and so they both went spinning off. The pier section seems to be heading for the Israeli port of Ashdod. I don't know where the third ship is, to which it had been attached. No naval personnel are said to have been injured, except for their pride.\n\nAnadolu Video: \"Waves sweep away US-built pier in Gaza \"\n\nSpeaking of Ashdod, that port city already has a harbor and the US could have delivered aid there to be trucked down to Gaza much more efficiently.

He acknowledged that \"It is not flowing at the rate that any of us would be happy with, because we always want more,\" noting that the US is striving to implement \"necessary security arrangements in place\" to prevent looting.\n\nHamas is attacking the shipments coming off the new US pier as the terrorist group has been doing since the start of humanitarian aid to Gaza - to rob the goods and sell them on the black market to Gazan civilians. But there's another reason for the attacks, which may become a regular feature in the vicinity of the pier.\n\nUnited Nations officials reported that approximately a dozen trucks loaded with aid supplies from the pier failed to reach their intended destinations within Gaza. The officials stated that impoverished Gazans seized control of the aid, and the trucks were unable to take alternative routes due to restrictions imposed by Israel.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that \"An ambitious US effort to get aid into Gaza via a floating pier in the Mediterranean Sea has gotten off to a sluggish start, facing many of the same logistical challenges that have throttled broader attempts to ease the humanitarian crisis in the besieged Palestinian enclave.\"\n\nThe WSJ continued: \"The Pentagon spent $320 million and engaged 1,000 soldiers and sailors to open a major maritime corridor last week, delivering on President Biden's promise in March that the US military would install a temporary dock off the Gaza coast for cargo ships to unload food, water, and other supplies. Fourteen ships from the US and other countries are involved in a mission supported by humanitarian groups and several nations including Israel.\"\n\nHisham Khreisat, a Jordanian military and strategic affairs expert, told Anadolu in March that \"the floating port off the shores of Gaza is a humanitarian facade hiding voluntary migration to Europe. This military tactical port will receive Israeli approval because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been seeking this idea since the beginning of the war, aiming for the voluntary displacement of Gazans and their fleeing to Europe.\"\n\nPA analyst Usame Abdulhadi told Anadolu in March that the US and Israel were not being honest about the project. \"If they were honest, the trucks and massive bulldozers entering Gaza to build the port would have stepped up to rescue thousands of wounded who continue to bleed to death under the rubble of homes destroyed by the Occupying state,\" he said. \"This pier will be built to strengthen Israel's sovereignty on the coast, to render the Rafah Border Crossing ineffective, to end Palestinian sovereignty, and to encourage the migration of the people of Gaza.\"\n\nAccording to US officials, the floating pier was intended to quickly ramp up operations after initially opening, with a target capacity of enabling 150 trucks per day to enter Gaza and provide aid to at least 500,000 people monthly.\n\nJake Sullivan dismissed suggestions that the currently lower throughput levels indicated poor planning, instead attributing it to \"a dynamic environment.\"\n\nThe pier has commenced operations at a critical juncture in the nearly eight-month conflict, as Hamas attacks have obstructed and delayed passage through the two southern border crossings that previously served as the main conduits for aid entering Gaza.\n\nThe maritime corridor, coupled with an ongoing air-drop campaign, was designed to supplement the more cost-effective and efficient ground deliveries. However, notes the WSJ, if the sea route manages to scale up operations while the Rafah campaign persists, the pier could potentially become a vital lifeline for a population facing famine conditions.\n\nAnd a lifeline, as every sane person understands, means a connection for the suffering civilians in Gaza to seek a better life in Europe, the US, and South America.", "source": {"uri":

The mission reportedly involved fourteen ships from the US and other countries. At the same time, the US sent billions of dollars of weapons to \"Israel\" amid its genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn its inaugural week of operations, only 820 tons of aid were transported through the pier, with approximately two-thirds reaching distribution points within Gaza, according to the Pentagon's statement on Thursday. This falls well short of the initial target of 90 truckloads per day and accounts for just 15% of the estimated minimum daily requirement for a population of over two million people facing famine.\n\nWeather conditions present a significant challenge, with rough seas in the Mediterranean posing a threat to the pier's integrity and safety. Storms delayed the installation process, and further interruptions are possible. While the summer months are anticipated to be relatively calm, operations may need to cease by September, necessitating the dismantling of the pier.\n\nThe UN stopped food distribution in the southern Gaza city of Rafah on May 21 due to a lack of supplies and an untenable security situation as a result of the Israeli expansion of a military operation in Rafah.\n\nThe UN warned that humanitarian operations all around the territory were near collapse.\n\nIn the same context, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said on May 20 that delivering aid to Gaza via land routes was irreplaceable in terms of the volume of assistance required by the 2.2 million population in Gaza.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) urged on May 17 for the opening of additional crossing points into the Gaza Strip, saying they are a lifeline for the Palestinians.\n\nWFP warned that the escalation of IOF activity in Rafah risks stopping humanitarian operations in Gaza.\n\nA top UN official said on May 9 that \"Israel's\" blockade of major crossings into Gaza has shut off the main entrance route for supplies, notably gasoline, making humanitarian operations nearly impossible.\n\nAndrea De Domenico, head of the United Nations humanitarian agency (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territories expressed that the \"main entry point for all humanitarian aid\" had been lost.", "source": {"uri": "english.almayadeen.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Mayadeen English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_mayadeen_english@english.almayadeen.net", "name": "Al Mayadeen

But despite their efforts, in the first week of operations only 820 tons of aid was delivered through the pier and just two-thirds of that reached distribution points in Gaza, the Pentagon revealed on Thursday.That amount is roughly the same as 71 truckloads which falls below the initial target of 90 truckloads a day and is about 15% of the estimated minimum daily need for more than 2 million people facing a famine, according to a report published on Saturday.Citing UN officials, the report adds that more than a dozen trucks from the pier never made it to their destinations in Gaza, and that the trucks were unable to use alternative routes due to Israeli restrictions even after desperate civilians commandeered the aid.The supplies goes through a cumbersome process; supplies is transported about 200 miles across the Mediterranean Sea to a floating platform built by the US. The pallets are then transported another 6 miles to a floating US-built causeway secured to the beach by Israeli army engineers, and are then driven another few hundred feet down the causeway and onto the beach into a zone controlled by Israeli soldiers. Another issue that the US faces is that Hamas has said it would treat the US forces at the pier as an occupying forces.US officials have also said that the floating pier would expand capacity to enable 150 trucks a day to enter Gaza, in the hopes of aiding at least 500,000 people a month.A report from Sputnik on Thursday revealed that the pier was first used to bring in military equipment before bringing in food; however, the first delivery of food was for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. The report adds that even if the pier begins running at full capacity, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has repeatedly emphasized that it will not be enough and Israel must open land routes to allow aid in.On Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered an immediate halt to Israel's military offensive in Rafah. The court has said that the attack on Gaza's southernmost city has already displaced more than 800,000 people less than 20 days after it first began its assault.The court's decision has added to the increasing pressure that Israel now faces, following arrest warrants that were issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas leader Yehiya Sinwar and two others for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Palestinian authorities have reported that over 35,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict first broke out in October.

It was beached on Saturday after seeking to help free a US army tug that was helping move the floating pier from an area off the Gaza coast to near Ashdod due to adverse weather conditions.\n\nThe army tug resembles a flat section of the floating pier, so it was initially mistaken for a part of the floating pier.\n\nThe tug is several dozen feet long, has a small wheelhouse on it, and is gray like the rest of the pier. The US was moving the floating pier toward an area near Ashdod because of the high swells that emerged on Thursday and Friday. The swells were around 1.5 meters, and winds gusted to some 20 knots.\n\nThese higher seas and waves apparently necessitated moving the pier. It is also not the first time the pier has been affected by weather conditions. When it was first constructed near Ashdod, it had to wait to be deployed because of turbulent waters.\n\nThe US floating pier has been helping deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza. It was constructed after a decision in early March to deploy this unique US Army capability. The Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore capability was deployed beginning in mid-March with several vessels sailing from Fort Eustis across the Atlantic via Crete to the coast of Gaza. It began operations in mid-May.\n\nVessel rescue attempt\n\nOn Thursday evening, several vessels involved with moving the pier broke free from their moorings. The tug was beached on Ashdod Beach, a hundred meters north of a lifeguard stand near an area called Beersheba Beach. On Thursday, the LCM 8558 came to try to help the tug. It is apparently not intended for this type of salvage operation, however, and became stranded on the beach near the tug with low tide. It had to be dug out with a front-loader.\n\nThe US had been trying to free the LCM and the tug since Saturday. The USAV Matamoros, a larger US Army vessel, came to help on Saturday afternoon. It took time to connect a rope from the Matamoros to the LCM. By midday Sunday, a rope was attached, and the LCM was ready to be pulled off.\n\nThe tide remained an issue because the low tide was around six in the afternoon. Around nine in the evening, a US military official said the LCM was pulled off the beach, with the hope that it would remain free of the sand. The goal will then be to take the tug off the beach. Then, the vessels will all be united with the floating pier and likely return to the coast of Gaza so humanitarian aid can be delivered again.\n\nThe Israel Navy assisted in the efforts to free the ships. Israelis from Ashdod initially became fascinated by the new attraction on the beach. After a day, the stranded vessels became of less interest, and people returned to sunning themselves.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_dock_(jetty)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Floating dock (jetty)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tugboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Mechanized", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landing Craft Mechanized"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matamoros,_Tamaulipas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Eustis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Eustis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knot (unit)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sailing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crete"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Crete"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beersheba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beersheba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Nudism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Beach Basketball", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/598947", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Ted Cruz (R-TX) is reportedly planning to put forward a War Powers Resolution that would force President Joe Biden to abandon his administration's floundering Gaza humanitarian aid pier initiative.\n\nThe senator argued that the humanitarian aid pier has become a magnet for attacks since its construction, potentially endangering American servicemen. He also suggested that the aid flowing through the pier will end up in the hands of Hamas -- the Palestinian terror group which rules Gaza and launched the ongoing war there by invading Israel on Oct. 7 and murdering 1,200 people -- instead of Gaza residents.\n\nThe Biden administration issued a directive to erect the $320 million pier in response to allegations that the Israeli government has not done enough to ensure a sufficient flow of humanitarian aid into the war-torn enclave.\n\n\"The Biden White House's foreign policy is utterly backwards,\" Cruz told Punchbowl News. \"He is blocking weapons to Israel ... and he has just recently spent hundreds of millions of dollars building this pier in Gaza to continue providing aid to Gaza that will go directly to Hamas.\"\n\nWar Powers Resolutions are of privileged status, meaning that a political party holding a majority in the US Congress cannot prevent the resolution from being brought to the floor for a vote. Democrats currently hold a majority in the Senate, where a Republican-led initiative challenging the foreign policy of Biden, a Democrat, would be difficult to pass.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has indicated that he would not approve of a direct vote regarding the Gaza pier on the Senate floor, claiming that the White House has already issued a veto threat.\n\n\"The power of the War Powers Resolution is that Schumer can't block the vote,\" Cruz said.\n\nCruz acknowledged that the resolution is designed to place vulnerable Democrats in a difficult position. Democrats have become increasingly critical of the Israeli war effort in recent months, with some suggesting that the Jewish state has committed \"genocide\" and pressuring the Biden administration to secure a ceasefire.\n\n\"This War Powers Resolution is a mechanism for forcing a vote and getting every Democrat on record -- where do you stand? Do you support undermining Israel and supporting Hamas?\" Cruz said.\n\nSince the completion of its construction, the Gaza pier has not lived up to expectations.\n\nDuring a Tuesday press conference, Gen. Patrick S. Ryder, the US Defense Department's press secretary, revealed that none of the 569 metric tons of humanitarian aid delivered to the pier has been distributed to Palestinian civilians. Other reports claim that local gangs have ransacked the trucks and stripped them of their aid, complicating aid delivery logistics.\n\nLast weekend, portions of the pier itself were dismantled when violent waves caused four transportation vessels to detach from their moorings and beach on shore.\n\nCruz also plans on advancing a bill to guarantee US arms shipments to Israel. The \"Assuring Resupply of Munitions Act of 2024\" would prevent the Biden administration from obstructing weapons deliveries to the Jewish state until a year after the Israel-Hamas war has concluded.\n\n\"I will use a War Powers Resolution to force a showdown in the Senate on Joe Biden's policy toward Israel,\" Cruz tweeted earlier this month. \"What he's doing is obscene.

The aid is transported across the causeway by small boats after initially being unloaded onto the huge floating dock. The U.N. official said the repair could take a week.\n\nAn official announcement from the United States is expected on Tuesday. Contacted by NBC News, US Central Command declined to comment.\n\nThe damage is the latest setback to the temporary pier system, which was first announced by President Joe Biden during his State of the Union address in March and became operational just two weeks ago.\n\nOver the weekend, four small U.S. military boats involved in transporting aid broke away from their moorings due to bad weather, Central Command said. Two of them were stranded on the southern coast of Israel, near the city of Ashdod, while the other two were stranded in Gaza.\n\nA U.S. service member also remains in critical condition in an Israeli hospital after suffering non-combat injuries at the dock last week, a U.S. defense official said. Two other soldiers were slightly injured.\n\nThe temporary dock, known in military parlance as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS) capability, was designed to deliver more aid to Gaza and help fight famine, which the U.N. says , broke out in the north of the besieged strip. .\n\nThe aid ships are inspected by Israeli security officials in Cyprus before sailing to the temporary dock, located several kilometers off the coast of Gaza.\n\nThe first sign of problems with the roadway came in a video posted Monday on Israeli social media. In the footage, a man believed to be an Israeli soldier in Gaza filmed what appeared to be a piece of the causeway floating in the Mediterranean.\n\nLook what's happening to the American barge, it's just disconnected and practically flooded, the man said in Hebrew. Everything is flowing.\n\nAt least one truck appeared to be on the loose piece of pavement in the video.\n\nAt full operational capacity, the pier is expected to be able to deliver up to 150 trucks of aid each day, according to the Pentagon.\n\nThe US military also airdropped aid into Gaza. But this has been criticized as both costly and ineffective, especially when compared to delivery via land crossings controlled by Egypt and Israel.\n\nThe new obstacles to helping the besieged Palestinians emerged after the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced last week that he was seeking to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel's defense minister. The court also announced that it was seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other Hamas leaders.\n\nThe ICC alleges that Israeli leaders bear criminal responsibility for a list of war crimes, including starving civilians.\n\nIsrael has strongly denied the allegations and cited the pier as evidence that it is working to deliver food to Gaza by sea, air and land.\n\nWhat Are The

Two went ashore in Gaza, and two more are on the beach within Israeli territory to the north, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNo one was hurt in the casualty, but photos released by Reuters appear to show a handful of U.S. troops in a temporary \"feet-dry\" status on the sand in Israel. It is unclear whether servicemembers were forced to disembark on contested territory; the White House has pledged that no American boots will touch the ground during the operation.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, the Pentagon reiterated that American troops will not enter Gaza. The aid pier remains fully functional, and \"efforts to recover the vessels are under way with assistance from the Israeli Navy,\" U.S. Central Command said in a statement.\n\nThe grounding is the latest in a string of setbacks and delays for the aid pier. During the mobilization and setup process in April, USNS 2nd Lt. John P. Bobo - a ro/ro cargo ship operated by Military Sealift Command - suffered a fire in a mechanical space and had to return to port for repairs. Heavy weather further delayed the construction plan. Even after it became functionally operational, the pier did not deliver meaningful quantities of aid to recipients until last week because of serious security challenges in the shoreside distribution system. And last week, three personnel were hurt in a non-combat accident during cargo operations. ABC reported that the injuries were caused by a forklift mishap during the offloading of a Ready Reserve sealift ship, the Roy P. Benavidez.

The damage has caused a temporary suspension in aid, which sounds worse than it is because, according to the Pentagon last week, it wasn't likely that any of the aid that arrived through the pier had even been distributed to civilians in the first place.\n\nEvidently, $320 million in taxpayer dollars doesn't go as far as it used to. Perhaps we can consider that another effect of \"Bidenflation.\"\n\nThe pier debacle has thus far been perfectly representative of Biden's term in office. He decided to do something that sounds morally righteous while ignoring all the very real obstacles that make his goal impossible, put U.S. soldiers in harm's way to do it, wasted millions in taxpayer dollars, and inadvertently helped terrorists, all for the final result to be a shoddily done project that is falling apart at the seams.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Falling apart at the seams\" also applies to Biden's campaign, which Democrats are now freaking out over despite the fact that they refused to indulge any serious primary challenges, even though it has been obvious that Biden would be a weak candidate. Biden's age was never going to get any lower, inflation kept driving prices higher, and Biden's approval rating has been abysmal going back to his botched Afghanistan withdrawal, which put U.S. soldiers in harm's way, lost billions of dollars' worth of military equipment, and allowed the Taliban to retake control of Afghanistan. Sound familiar?\n\nBiden has handled just about every problem that has come before him with a level of stunning incompetence that is only a surprise if you forgot he was still Joe Biden. If nothing else, the fantastical Gaza pier idea and its entirely predictable execution are further proof that Biden never should have become president in the first place.

The ship, LCM 8558, is a landing craft.\n\nThe U.S. military and the IDF worked together late in the afternoon to try to find a solution to the stranded ship problem. A front loader extracted the sand under its large propellers.\n\nNext, the front loader was attached to the starboard bow of the vessel in an attempt to swing the watercraft free. Low tide prevented this operation. Local authorities attempt to free a US ship stranded in Ashdod that was en route to the Gaza Strip, May 25, 2024. (credit: SETH J. FRANTZMAN)\n\nEventually, the USAV Matamoros, a U.S. Navy ship, arrived offshore to attempt to provide relief. As the sun set, the IDF attempted to help with a drone to bring a line to Matamoros. This didn't work because the current was carrying the line too strongly and the drone wasn't powerful enough. Later, men attempted to swim the line to the waiting ship.\n\nMeanwhile, the landing craft remained stuck on the beach. This is a rare example of the ability of the United States and Israel to work in real time to free a ship like this. This is probably the first time in history that a US military ship has run aground on a beach on the Israeli coast.\n\nUS completes construction of aid pier\n\nThe U.S. military sent ships to build a floating pier in March. They had to wait until the end of April to arrive.\n\nThe jetty was built near Ashdod and then towed off the coast of Gaza, where it became operational in early May, allowing trucks to transport pallets to the shore.\n\nA piece of the pier floated more than 1.5 meters due to high winds and sweeps on Friday evening. This caused the landing craft to end up on the beach at Ashdod, necessitating this operation.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Loader (equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashdod", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashdod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propeller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Propeller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_dock_(jetty)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floating dock (jetty)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Mechanized", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landing Craft Mechanized"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landing craft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matamoros,_Tamaulipas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Matamoros, Tamaulipas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bow (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_grounding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ship grounding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online_Grocery_Stores", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Online Grocery Stores", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Nautical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Nautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/598885", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598983", "eventUri": "eng-9598983", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 103, "relevance": 1}

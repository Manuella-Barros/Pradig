They argued she was trafficked as a 15-year-old, which the authorities should have prevented. They claimed Begum had the right to address Javid before her citizenship was revoked, which was denied.\n\nThe supreme court said, however, that that right \"would be liable to undermine the effectiveness of such a decision in cases concerned with national security\".\n\nLast year Begum, now 24, lost her first appeal against the decision to revoke her citizenship on national security grounds at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac). Earlier this year, three judges at the court of appeal unanimously dismissed her bid to overturn the Siac decision. The Home Office also opposed the challenge.\n\nMaya Foa, the joint executive director of Reprieve, said: \"If Shamima Begum has committed crimes, she can be charged and prosecuted in a British court. The UK is more than capable of handling the case of a 15-year-old schoolgirl who was groomed online by an organised trafficking operation.\n\n\"Court of appeal judges recognised that Shamima Begum had her citizenship stripped for political reasons, not on the basis of national security, but concluded they were not able to check the extreme powers currently wielded by the home secretary. The supreme court has now agreed that, in practice, stripping Ms Begum's citizenship leaves her stateless.\n\n\"Exiling British nationals like Ms Begum is about politics, not the law. The prior government's failed do-nothing approach must be abandoned. Our politicians should take responsibility and repatriate the small number of British families in this position so their cases can be dealt with here in Britain.\"\n\nSpeaking in February, Dame Sue Carr, who was one of the appeal judges ruling on the case, said they agreed with the commission's decision on Begum's citizenship. She said: \"Ms Begum may well have been influenced and manipulated by others but still have made a calculated decision to travel to Syria and align with Isil [Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant].\n\n\"It could be argued the decision in Ms Begum's case was harsh. It could also be argued that Ms Begum is the author of her own misfortune. But it is not for this court to agree or disagree with either point of view.\n\n\"The only task of the court was to assess whether the deprivation decision was unlawful.

citizenship after leaving the country as a teenager to marry an Islamic State group fighter lost a bid Wednesday to take her case to the UK's top court.\n\nShamima Begum, 24, had hoped to challenge an earlier ruling in which she lost an appeal against the removal of her citizenship.\n\nBut UK Supreme Court justices said she could not appeal again following her defeat at the Court of Appeal in February.\n\nThe justices found that her proposed grounds for appeal \"do not raise an arguable point of law\".\n\nBegum, whose family is of Bangladeshi origin, was 15 years old when she left her east London home for Syria with two school friends in 2015.\n\nWhile there, she married an IS fighter and had three children, none of whom survived.\n\nShe said she was left stateless in February 2019 when Britain's then-interior minister revoked her citizenship on national security grounds after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp.\n\nIt means she has not been able to return to Britain from the camp in northern Syria.\n\nIn February 2023, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) upheld the removal of her citizenship.\n\nShe then went to the Court of Appeal, where her legal team argued that the government had failed to consider its legal duties to Begum as a potential victim of trafficking.\n\nBut the court ruled that the risk to national security took precedence.\n\nThe court also ruled that Begum had not been left stateless as she retained Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother.\n\nBegum's lawyer told the SIAC hearing that her client had been \"influenced\" along with her friends by a \"determined and effective\" IS group \"propaganda machine\".\n\nThe appeal court accepted that Begum \"may well have been influenced and manipulated by others\", but added she could \"still have made a calculated decision to travel to Syria\".\n\nAround 900 people are estimated to have travelled from Britain to Syria and Iraq to join the IS group.\n\nOf those, around 150 are believed to have been stripped of their citizenship, according to government figures.\n\nIn March, a group of United Nations experts urged the UK government to repatriate Begum.", "source": {"uri":

Kumbhani's nomination form was rejected on April 21 after his three proposers submitted affidavits to Surat District Election Officer Saurabh Pardhi claiming that the signatures on the document were not theirs. The nomination form of Suresh Padsala, the Congress's substitute candidate in Surat, was also invalidated on the same grounds.\n\nThe other eight candidates, including one from the Bahujan Samaj Party, also eventually withdrew their nomination forms.\n\nWhat can we do if candidates withdraw voluntarily: CEC\n\nChief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar Monday said the Election Commission could not intervene if candidates withdrew from elections on their own. He was responding to a question on the BJP's uncontested win from the Surat Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nAddressing a press conference on the eve of counting, Kumar said the EC's attempt was to have a contest in each seat. \"If other candidates decide to withdraw, what can we do? If they have been pressured, then we have a role. If they are doing it voluntarily, if it was gaming like that, how would I know this? Every RO should ensure that no one is made to withdraw by force,\" Kumar said.\n\nAsked if the voters in the constituency should have had the chance to opt for NOTA, Kumar said there was no legal provision for that. The option of NOTA was introduced in 2013 after a Supreme Court verdict.

Follow our updates for the latest trends and round-wise updates.\n\nSurat Election Result 2024: Surat Lok Sabha constituency is one of the 26 constituencies in Gujarat and is classified as a general category seat. On April 22, BJP candidate Mukesh Dalal was declared the uncontested winner after the withdrawal of all other eight candidates. This followed the rejection of the Congress nominee Nilesh Kumbhani's nomination papers due to alleged discrepancies in the signatures of their proposers. The nominations were dismissed under Section 36(2) of the Representation of the People Act, which allows the Returning Officer to examine and reject nominations based on valid objections. BJP has consistently maintained its dominance in Surat in past elections.\n\nSurat's uncontested result challenged in Gujarat HC?\n\nA petition was filed in the Gujarat High Court, seeking to nullify the unopposed election of the BJP candidate from the Surat Lok Sabha seat, as per Deccan Herald reports. The petitioners, who are voters from Surat, argue that the Returning Officer's (RO) decision to reject the Congress candidate's nomination was not in accordance with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act (RPA), 1951.\n\nMukesh Dalal of the BJP was declared the winner after the Congress candidate, Nilesh Kumbhani, had his nomination rejected, and the other candidates withdrew their names. A writ petition is also expected to be filed to declare the result illegal. Previously, the Gujarat High Court had dismissed a public interest litigation (PIL), suggesting that the issue should be addressed through an election petition.\n\nThe petitioners contend that Section 36 of the RPA is a comprehensive code for determining the validity of nomination forms. One clause specifies that the RO should not adjourn the scrutiny of the papers or delay it for any reason except in cases of riot, open violence, or causes beyond control. In this instance, the petitioners assert that no such circumstances were present to justify the RO's decision.\n\nWhat happened in 2019?\n\nIn the 2019 general elections, Dipsinh Shankarsinh Rathod of BJP won with 701,984 votes, while the runner-up, Thakor Rajendrasinh Shivsinh, secured 432,997 votes. In the 2014 elections, Dipsinh Shankarsinh Rathod also won, with a margin of 508,437 votes against Kandhalbhai Sarmanbhai Jadeja from NCP, who received 240,466 votes. The Surat Lok Sabha constituency covers part of the Surat district and includes seven legislative assembly segments: Olpad, Surat East, Surat North, Varachha Road, Karanj, Katargam, and Surat West. All these assembly seats are currently held by BJP.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_Lok_Sabha_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surat Lok Sabha constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Gujarat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Gujarat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deccan Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_North_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surat North Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karanj_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karanj Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varachha_Road_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varachha Road Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_East_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surat East Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipsinh_Shankarsinh_Rathod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dipsinh Shankarsinh Rathod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_West_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surat West Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katargam_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katargam Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olpad_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olpad Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thakor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thakor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest_litigation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest litigation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu_Legislative_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surat_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surat district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surat district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Contests", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Petitions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/whatsappimage2024-06-03at7.02.37pm1-171746378174416_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622177", "eventUri": "eng-9622177", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 299}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

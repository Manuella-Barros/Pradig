While performing at Broccoli City Festival on July 27, the \"Savage\" songstress channeled her hometown in a Western-inspired 'fit complete with a rhinestone-encrusted cowboy hat and matching cowboy boots. That's not all she wore, though -- in true Hot Girl fashion, the 29-year-old also sported a pair of yassified undies, taking the cowboycore trend to a whole new level.\n\nMegan Thee Stallion never fails to put on a show, and her recent appearance at Broccoli City Festival was no exception. While performing hits like \"Body,\" \"Thot Sh*t,\" and \"Big Ole Freak,\" the rapper, whose real name is Megan Pete, stunned the crowd at the Washington, D.C. concert with her bedazzled blue panties.\n\nThe cheeky garment was covered in embellishments from top to bottom, and featured a belted design with an \"MTS\"-branded belt buckle that nodded to her stage name.\n\nShe paired the panties with an equally jaw-dropping blinged-out bra that featured a draped design across the stomach. The top was also connected to a choker and a Y-shaped statement necklace that appeared to take inspo from a bolo tie.\n\nShe completed the look with a cropped jacket with fringe sleeves, a matching hat, and cowboy boots.\n\nYou can take the girl out of Houston, but you can't take Houston out of the girl.\n\nIt seems like Megan Thee Stallion has been feeling herself lately. On July 28, the rapper posted a selfie-filled photo dump on Instagram, and included a snap of herself in yet another pair of skivvies.\n\nThe white briefs had a red stripe on the edges and matched perfectly with her white baby tee, which was adorned with the Japanese flag. The \"Hot Girl Summer\" inventor recently filmed a music video for her viral hit single, \"Mamushi\" in Tokyo, and judging by her shirt it stands to reason the 29-year-old enjoyed her trip.\n\nThe photo carousel also included pics of her Louis Vuitton purse, bright pink nails, and eye-catching jewelry.\n\n\"Need me a baddie like Megan Thee Stallion\u2728\ud83d\udc0e,\" she captioned the post.

I'm really not. Policing rap songs really isn't my thing because I listen to rap and hip-hop and don't put much stake into it. HOWEVER. I was a little taken aback at that Megan Thee Stallion performance on stage for Kamala Harris. I mean THAT is how Kamala is going to convince Americans she is a serious candidate?\"\n\nMegan performed four songs at the rally: \"Girls in the Hood,\" \"Mamushi,\" \"Body\" and \"Savage.\" The rapper, who wore a blue suit with a tie and cropped white shirt, brought a group of similarly dressed backup dancers.\n\nBefore kicking off \"Body,\" the rapper told the crowd: \"Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies. And if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for.\"\n\nHer statement was possibly a reference to Harris' long-standing support for reproductive rights and reinstating Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that granted the federal government the power to legislate abortion.\n\nMegan, a Grammy-award winning artist known for her provocative lyrics, rallied the crowd to support Harris at the polls in November.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Megan Thee Stallion's representatives for comment by email.\n\nSocial media users were divided about Lahren's opinion and replied to her posts to share their thoughts.\n\n\"Pandering / buying votes has always been in their #ProgressivePlaybook. Then, the lights fade the crowds clear, and they go back to doing NOTHING for the people they promised to take care of,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"Only way she can get large crowds,\" another added.\n\n\"They lost the moral high ground when they had Amber Rose speak at the RNC and elevated any rapper that supports Trump,\" a commenter said.\n\nAnother wrote, \"Lol you must be joking.

Classy, bougie, ratchet, yeah. Sassy, moody, nasty, huh? Acting stupid, what's happening?\"\n\nOther users claimed that many people were only there for Stallion's performance since the moment it ended and Harris started talking, they left. Rumors about people leaving after the performance quickly swarmed social media.\n\nA user on X claimed that people started leaving 10 minutes into the Kamala Harris speech and said the rumors might be correct.\n\nOn Jul. 29, 2024, Megan Thee Stallion appeared on TikTok with Harris to promote the performance so that more people would show up at the rally.\n\nDuring the performance, some people were seen holding a sign with \"Hotties for Harris\" written on it which added to the negativity circulating social media about it.

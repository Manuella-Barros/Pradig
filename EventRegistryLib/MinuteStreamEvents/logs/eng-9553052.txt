They pointed out that Israel claims the offer accepted by Hamas on Sunday differed from the one that Israel had been prepared to accept the week before.\n\nTaking questions at the end of a lengthy speech setting out his foreign policy vision after six months in the job, Cameron said: \"There's a very fundamental difference between the US situation and the UK situation.\n\n\"The US is a massive state supplier of weapons to Israel. We do not have a UK government supply of weapons to Israel, we have a number of licences, and I think our defence exports to Israel are responsible for significantly less than 1% of their total.

Yet none have given any indication that crossing this apparent 'red line' will lead to any practical change in policy, or any consequences for Israel.\n\n\"To call Israel's behaviour unacceptable while continuing to supply the arms used to commit these same acts is immoral, hypocritical, and makes all of these governments complicit in Israel's crimes.\"\n\n\"Israeli forces are inflicting a genocide on Gaza, and everyone who has chosen to arm and support them is complicit in these war crimes,\" MSP Ross Greer said.\n\n\"The US government is the biggest arms dealer in the world and could have stopped the bombardment at any time it wanted. The fact they have been forced to change their position is a credit to the US anti-war movement and should serve as an inspiration to those of us protesting here for the UK Government to end its complicity.\n\n\"The fact that David Cameron is taking an even more morally bankrupt position than a blood-soaked White House should be a source of huge shame. The arms sales must stop, and so must the slaughter.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Cameron (above) insisted that the UK was in a different situation to the US because the Tory government does not supply weapons directly.\n\nO'Hara said that this line, when it was used by Rishi Sunak on Wednesday, \"demonstrated either a complete lack of understanding or a deliberate attempt at misleading\".\n\nThe UK Government does not directly hand weapons to Israel, but it has absolute control over all arms exports from its shores.\n\nREAD MORE: Brendan O'Hara: In place of a spine, UK must follow US on Israeli arms exports\n\nCameron said arms export licences would continue to be measured against the risk of international humanitarian law being broken.\n\nAnswering questions following a speech in London, he said: \"There's a very fundamental difference between the US situation and the UK situation.\n\n\"The US is a massive state supplier of weapons to Israel. We do not have a UK Government supply of weapons to Israel, we have a number of licences, and I think our defence exports to Israel are responsible for significantly less than 1% of their total. That is a big difference.\n\n\"On Rafah, we are clear that we would not support some major operation in Rafah unless there was a very clear plan for how to protect people and save lives and all the

We have not seen that plan, so in these circumstances we would not support a major operation in Rafah.\"\n\nBut he said there is a \"very fundamental difference\" between arms shipments from the U.S. and the U.K., where the government grants individual licenses to companies wanting to export arms overseas.\n\n\"The U.S. is a massive state supplier for weapons to Israel,\" he said. \"We do not have a U.K. government supply of weapons to Israel. We have a number of licenses, and I think our defense exports to Israel are responsible for significantly less than one percent of their total. That is a big difference.\"\n\nThe foreign secretary said he would stick \"very closely\" to the U.K.'s \"rigorous\" arms exports procedure.\n\nIt takes around six weeks to update the U.K.'s evidence on whether Israel is violating international humanitarian law, two U.K. officials -- granted anonymity to discuss the process -- confirmed to POLITICO. This is the basis on which arms exports would be suspended. But that means the U.K. could still be making a decision by the time any Rafah invasion has been completed.\n\nCameron has faced pressure from some MPs, including in his own party, to suspend arms exports to Israel. Israeli forces looked poised to conduct more operations in Rafah, home to some 1.7 million people -- despite warnings from allies not to do so.\n\nAsked if Biden was wrong to set conditions, the U.K.'s top diplomat replied: \"They are involved deeply in strategic and tactical conversations that the Israelis are having about how they prosecute this conflict. We have influence, we have agency, we have very frank conversations with the Israelis, but we're not in that same position.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_bloom@politico.eu", "name": "Dan Bloom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Heraldry", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Heraldry", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/09/GettyImages-2151581862-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553052", "eventUri": "eng-9553052", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The band, who formed in the 1990s, played the Pyramid Stage in 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2016, and also performed at Live At Worthy Farm in 2021, without an in-person audience, as the usual event had been cancelled due to the Covid 19 pandemic. Northern Irish musician Van Morrison has performed on the main stage eight times, according to the Victoria and Albert museum\u2019s Glastonbury Festival archive, but not all of these were headline slots. Coldplay was formed after the band members met at University College London (UCL) and they have cited U2, James, Travis and REM as musicians who have inspired them. The Brit-award winning group has had two number one singles in the UK charts with Viva La Vida and Paradise and their other hits have included Clocks, Magic, Fix You and Yellow. Since the release of their debut number-one record, Parachutes, in 2000, the band has had a streak of chart-topping studio albums. These include; A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&Y (2005) Viva La Vida Or Death And All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyloto (2011) and Ghost Stories (2014). There was also A Head Full Of Dreams (2015), Everyday Life (2019) and Music Of The Spheres (2021). During a special BBC Radio 2 Christmas show with presenter Jo Whiley in 2021, Martin, 47, said the band will release their last record in 2025 and plan to \u201conly tour\u201d after that. The group embarked on their most recent tour, Music Of The Spheres, in 2022, which is still ongoing. Their shows have been supported by a \u201cshow battery\u201d, supplied by BMW, which is recharged using solar power and generators powered by hydrotreated vegetable oil. Their forthcoming album, Moon Music, will be released in October.", "summary": "<p>Grammy award-winning band Coldplay will make history when they take to the stage at Glastonbury Festival on Saturday.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/coldplay-to-make-history-as-they-headline-glastonbury-festival-for-fifth-time/a40354858.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/Inm_ZdIOc9zDh5QlDtW1ElZ5JXo=/0x0:5866x3911/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/d2d1ce0c-45fe-4ff2-bc5f-98a804b225ab/ee342785-37ac-46a4-bfa0-caebd8e61941/2.72439105.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:04:14", "author": "Hannah Roberts, Pa Entertainment Reporter", "authors": ["Hannah Roberts, Pa Entertainment Reporter"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.293}

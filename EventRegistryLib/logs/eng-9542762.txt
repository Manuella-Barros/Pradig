[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nSpotrac's Michael Ginnitti updated the outlook around Chase, which includes a projected value of roughly $30 million per year on average:\n\nWhile much of the focus in Cincinnati has gone to Tee Higgins and his unsigned franchise tag, Chase (the reason Higgins has a tag and not an extension), has now been extension eligible for 4 months. Will the Bengals take a page out of Philly's book and rush to extend their core weapon this summer, or will they balance out Chase's value salary ($4.8M) against Higgins' tag ($21.8M), then look to re-up Ja'Marr next offseason? Waiting is a dangerous game at this position right now. Chase projects toward a 3 year, $90M extension in our system.\n\nGinnitti also spotlights Higgins, suggesting he's projected at a $23.3 million per year on average to align with Michael Pittaman Jr.'s deal -- the exact deal referenced in a recent report about the Bengals-Higgins standoff.\n\nWhile the projections shift, everything remains in a holding pattern for the Bengals. Higgins hasn't signed the tag yet and both parties have until mid-July to work out an extension or he'll play next season on it.\n\nAs for Chase, he's in no hurry to sign an extension, which makes plenty of sense considering how the market continues to escalate while he waits.\n\nThis stat alone explains why Bengals liked Amarius Mims so much Bengals legends love idea of throwback helmet for new jerseys Bengals fans will like what Chad Johnson has to say about Tee Higgins' contract", "source": {"uri": "bengalswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bengals Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_roling@bengalswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Chris Roling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Johnson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bengalswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2023/10/USATSI_21658845-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542762", "eventUri": "eng-9542762", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In fact, they've been so far apart, the Cincinnati franchise tagged him earlier this year -- meaning if the two sides don't reach an agreement soon, the wideout will have to play on a one-year pact worth roughly $21 million.\n\nJohnson, though, thinks the two will iron everything out at some point in the near future ... telling us at LAX this week, \"I think we're going to work it out. We'll figure it out.\"\n\nJohnson added he and Higgins have actually spoken \"a few times\" about it all ... and neither guy seems to be sweating things too much.\n\n\"It's business -- it's the nature of the business,\" the Bengals legend said. \"He's going to be all right, though.\"\n\nJohnson said the situation down in Atlanta is similar ... telling us that while Kirk Cousins might initially feel some type of way about the Falcons selecting Michael Penix Jr. with the No. 8 overall pick, he'll eventually get that it's nothing personal -- and be a good mentor for the former Washington star.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Squash", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/99/16by9/2024/04/30/99661e4500604fc6a5bb6d28579ec9d5_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542762", "eventUri": "eng-9542762", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Harris campaign has suggested it will announce the decision by Tuesday evening, when the vice president and her to-be-named running mate begin a five-day tour of presidential battleground states, starting in Philadelphia.\n\nSeveral of the contenders, including Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, canceled events this weekend, reflecting both a desire to be available for those conversations and to avoid drawing additional speculation from the news media about their chances.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, one that can pay dividends in votes and years of counsel or backfire disastrously. In some ways, Harris is setting a direction for the future of the party, a reality she intimately understands given her own head-spinning ascension to the top of the ticket.\n\nBut unlike previous nominees, who spent months considering candidates, she must make her decision on a compressed timeline. The shortened process clashes with what some former aides described as her typically deliberative decision-making approach.\n\nWhile other nominees started with lists of dozens of names, Harris has quickly narrowed hers to six, with Shapiro, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona widely seen by Democrats as the top contenders. Beshear, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have also participated in the vetting process.\n\nThose officials participated in an extensive and intrusive process that included hourslong videoconference interviews with former Attorney General Eric Holder, who once oversaw Barack Obama's vice presidential vetting, and Dana Remus, a former White House counsel for President Joe Biden and an outside legal counsel for the Harris campaign.\n\nThey submitted answers to hundreds of inquiries on a questionnaire and turned over hundreds of pages of documents including financial forms and policy papers - even old news releases issued by their offices. The process is meant to surface any personal or political issues that could later become a headache for the campaign.\n\nPeople close to Harris say that she had not devoted serious thought to the issue of selecting a vice president before Biden announced a little more than a week ago that he would exit the race. But they note that she is more intimately familiar with the position than some previous nominees given her current role.\n\n\"She never had to make a decision like this before, and it's different from hiring a top staff member or something like that,\" said Brian Brokaw, who managed Harris' campaigns for California attorney general. But, given her experience as vice president, he said: \"She probably has a very clear image in her mind of, what are the best traits and life experiences and job experiences to fill that position?\"\n\nFormer staff members in her Senate office and on her 2020 presidential campaign said that while she valued competence and loyalty, she also required a high level of personal rapport and comfort with people with whom she would work closely.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's going to come down to who can she have a relationship with, who can have the hard conversations with her,\" said Sen. Laphonza Butler, D-Calif., who has known Harris for more than a decade and served as a senior adviser on her 2020 presidential campaign. \"This is somebody she's going to have to see on a fairly regular basis for the next four years. And you got to do more than just tolerate them. There has to be some genuine like and care and a good vibe.\"\n\nWhile the selection has dominated the conversation within Democratic circles for days, there is deep uncertainty around her ultimate decision. The process has been kept to a small group of aides, some of whom have no official role in the campaign, and to family members, including her brother-in-law Tony West.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Harris, said the campaign would not provide public updates \"until the vice president announces who will be serving as her running mate.\"\n\nAs closely held as her deliberations have been, some broad choices have clearly been made. Harris is seriously considering only white men, reflecting concerns in some quarters of the party that the country will not elect two women or two people of color. She has also placed a premium on executive experience: Her list includes five governors and only one senator.\n\nOthers have stressed the importance of selecting someone from a battleground state, such as Shapiro or Kelly, who could help Harris gain an electoral edge in what is widely expected to remain a razor-tight contest. Both men are viewed as moderates and have records of winning independent and even some Republican voters.\n\nChampions of Kelly argue that his biography - the son of police officers, a Navy pilot, an astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was gravely wounded by a mass shooter - and his embrace of tougher immigration measures could also help inoculate Harris on concerns about her role in border policy.\n\nWalz, a folksy Midwestern former high school teacher and football coach, has become a liberal darling over the past few weeks, winning praise for calling Trump \"weird\" and coining a line of attack that has spread throughout the party.\n\nAnd Shapiro, who like Harris is a former state attorney general, brings a proven record of building broad coalitions across perhaps the most critical swing state, where 61% of voters viewed him favorably in a recent Fox News poll.\n\nShapiro and Harris have known each other for years: In 2006, Harris, then the San Francisco district attorney, and Shapiro, then a state representative, were tapped for a prestigious program for rising stars in American politics. They have remained in touch.\n\nPrevious presidential campaigns have spent up to five months searching for a vice presidential candidate. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee in 2012, started with a list of more than 50 names. He also spent time on the campaign trail with each of his five finalists. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee in 2016, had a list of 39 names that included Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who was announced as her running mate four months later.\n\nHarris, who began the process last week with just 12 contenders, has not yet met in person with any of her top choices.\n\nThat tight time frame will test what former aides describe as Harris' thorough, sometimes lawyerly approach to absorbing information before a big decision.\n\n\"She's somebody who wants to be briefed on every possible scenario around every issue that she's confronted with,\" Brokaw said. He added, \"She moves fast once a decision is made.\"\n\nEleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor of California, says Harris strikes a careful balance between her instinct and a review of facts.\n\nWhen she decided to run in 2018, Kounalakis, a first-time candidate, asked for Harris' endorsement.\n\nEven though the two women had been friends for nearly two decade, Harris asked a lot of questions and collected information about her campaign. Ultimately, however, she acted on instinct to back her bid, said Kounalakis, who is now among the leading contenders for governor in 2026.\n\nKounalakis said Harris was most likely approaching her vice presidential selection with a similar formula.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington_&_Burling", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covington & Burling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Remus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Remus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - at her Washington, DC, residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Reuters was first to report. The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters.\n\nHarris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nShe met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday and is also meeting candidates virtually, the sources said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are the other candidates in contention for the job.\n\nThe candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nUS Election I Kamala Harris hits the ground running\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nSome labor groups have also criticized Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate.\n\nWalz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age.\n\nWalz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years.

(Reuters)\n\nAs US Vice President Kamala Harris started interviewing top candidates for the position of vice president, some Democratic Party progressives are voicing reservations about the possibility that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro be picked for the job because of his pro-Israel positions on the Middle East conflict. Other Democrats are however saying he is being assailed just because of his being an observant Jew.\n\nHarris was expected to interview Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and, at her Washington residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programmes that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools\n\nShapiro is perceived as strong supporter of Israel. During the US university protests against the war in Gaza, Shapiro strongly criticised Penn State University for not standing up to anti-Semitism.\n\nBut Shapiro has been also quite critical of Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, describing him as \"one of the worst leaders of all time\" and an obstacle to a two-state peaceful solution of the conflict. He also said the US \"can't ignore the death and destruction\" in Gaza.\n\nSome of Shapiro's defenders say he is being assailed because of his being an observant Jew. \"We have a real opportunity to win the election and the idea that they're now trying to divide us because Josh is the only Jewish person who could be the VP continues the unfortunate division that we've seen within the party since October 7,\" said Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz.\n\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nShe met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday and is also meeting candidates virtually, the sources said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are the other candidates in contention for the job.\n\nThe candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the November 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nSome labour groups have also criticised Kelly for not supporting proposed legislation they argue would boost union organising.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate.\n\nWalz has become a favourite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age.\n\nWalz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair.

The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nSome labor groups have also criticized Kelly for opposing proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate.\n\nWalz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age.\n\nWalz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair. Trust me.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

Pritzker were meeting with Harris this weekend -- and what the meetings signify.\n\nHarris campaign spokespersons have said that they are looking beyond a VP candidate's electability.\n\nAll of the top finalists are white men, likely due to the assumption that voters would prefer a politically moderate white man to balance out the Democratic ticket, as reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBeyond demographics, the ideal Democratic running mate will espouse the three Cs: competence, chemistry, and core values, campaign representatives told CNN.\n\nThe search team met with lawyers and investigators to complete the deep vetting process that all high-level candidates must pass before receiving an official nomination on Saturday.\n\nHarris is scheduled to attend a rally with her running mate for the first time in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nThe event will kick off the duo's first five-day campaign tour with stops in seven battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\nExcitement over the possibility of the Pennsylvania governor joining Harris on the Democratic ticket began almost as soon as Biden gave up the nomination.\n\nAt a Harris campaign event in Philadelphia on July 26, speakers devoted a significant amount more time to discussing the merits of a possible Vice President Shapiro than directing comments to Harris herself.\n\nLatest in the US Presidential Election:\n\nAttendees also donated millions more dollars to her campaign than was originally expected, according to Politico.\n\nThe Pennslyvania governor had intended to attend fundraisers in the Hamptons this weekend, but abruptly canceled those plans, Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told ABC News.\n\nSome have speculated that Harris may be leaning toward Shapiro as a pick thanks to the expected debut of her running mate in Philadelphia, but the link could be coincidental.\n\nThe governor of Minnesota has also been named a favorite for Democratic VP by campaign analysts.\n\nWalz has been a vocal supporter of Harris for president and participated in several campaign events for the candidate.\n\nHe was recently credited with labeling Republicans as \"weird,\" a description that has appeared to resonate with voters and even the top Democratic candidate, according to CNN.\n\n\"Some of what [Trump] and his running mate are saying is just plain weird,\" Harris said last week, echoing the governor's term.\n\nWalz was scheduled to appear at a campaign event for Harris in New Hampshire on Sunday, but he too canceled the plans on short notice.\n\nA spokesman for the governor said he would instead be traveling to Washington to talk to Harris, according to CBS News.\n\nKelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut, represents a state less than 370 miles away from the border with Mexico -- a quality that analysts believe could help Harris assuage complaints that she is weak on immigration policy, according to Arkansas Online.\n\nLike Shapiro and Walz, WAPO also reported that Kelly abruptly changed his plans this weekend.\n\nThe senator has been criticized by some labor groups for opposing proposed legislation that could boost union organizing, losing the support of the largest workers group in the US -- the United Auto Workers Union.\n\nThe former spaceman is married to former US representative Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011 and has worked with his wife since then to bolster limitations on gun ownership, according to The Guardian.\n\nAlthough Harris has promised to announce her running mate by Tuesday at the latest, the name could be revealed as soon as tomorrow, per Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US

The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters.\n\nHarris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nShe met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nSome labor groups have also criticized Kelly for opposing proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing.\n\nShawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate.\n\nWalz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age.\n\nWalz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair.

Tim Walz, U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro - at her Washington, D.C., residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Reuters was first to report. The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters.\n\nHarris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former Attorney-General Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nShe met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nHarris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza.\n\n\"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Gov. Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a long-time top aide has also been questioned, and labour groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labour groups have also criticized Kelly for opposing proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate.\n\nWalz has become a favourite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age.\n\nWalz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair.

J.B. Pritzker of Illinois released a nearly four-minute video this week promoting his accomplishments in office.\n\nIf there were any questions about the home life of Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, resurfaced a testimonial about their loving marriage and posted it to social media.\n\nAnd if someone was wondering about, say, fundraising ability, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Andy Beshear of Kentucky were scheduled to appear at last-minute simultaneous events Monday afternoon in Minneapolis and Chicago. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was also set to do a fundraiser Saturday night in New Hampshire.\n\nIt is all for an audience of one: Vice President Kamala Harris. As the clock ticks down on her timeline to select a running mate, whom Harris is expected to announce by Tuesday, the men still in contention are doing whatever they can to showcase what they could bring to the ticket and keep themselves in the public eye.\n\nThat thirst has prompted a flood of gauzy videos, cable news appearances, fundraisers and other stops -- Walz will campaign for Harris on Sunday, also in New Hampshire -- serving as a capstone to what has been a two-week sprint toward the first major decision of her presidential campaign. The vetting team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, completed its work Thursday, leaving the choice in Harris' hands after she conducts in-person interviews and spends time deliberating with her advisers.\n\nThe lobbying efforts come as Harris is having to choose a running mate without the typical months to spend time with potential candidates, weighing who would be best as both a political and a governing partner.\n\nPast nominees have used the weeks leading up to their vice presidential announcement as public tryouts, stumping with finalists as a test of camaraderie while spending important time deliberating behind the scenes.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney held campaign events with each of the five finalists to be his running mate before choosing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Romney said Friday that he did not watch any of the TV appearances his potential running mates made during that period.\n\n\"Nope, never saw them on the screen,\" Romney wrote in a text message. \"Went on the trail together. Emphasis was capability if elected, not election impact, which we thought was minimal.\"\n\nUnder this rushed time frame, the auditions have been more diffuse, spaced out across social media, cable television hits and speeches.\n\nWhether those appearances matter to Harris remains unclear. It is not known how much outside content Harris, who planned to be in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, was consuming.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., an early endorser of Harris' previous presidential campaign, suggested that the question of who could draw sharp contrasts with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, former President Donald Trump's running mate, and the Republican ticket as a whole was relevant. But she sounded skeptical of the in-plain-view tryouts.\n\n\"I don't think people talking publicly is going to sway her from her basic decision-making process,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris' team has received reams of documents from each of the finalists, and it conducted video interviews this past week.\n\nSome of the top contenders canceled planned events for Friday and Saturday -- when Harris had set aside time to conduct final interviews, according to two people who had been briefed on her schedule but were not authorized to speak publicly about the process. Aides for some of the contenders said they wanted to keep their schedules clear in case Harris' team called.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania canceled a three-event fundraising swing through the Hamptons, and Beshear pulled out of a stop in western Kentucky, prompting a new wave of headlines Thursday.\n\n\"I was going to perform, of course, with Blink-182 on Sunday, but I've canceled in order to clear my schedule,\" joked Pritzker in an interview on MSNBC, referring to the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago this weekend.\n\nBut for the scores of Democratic busybodies and political obsessives who carefully track the process, the prolific public appearances have provided seemingly endless fodder for each candidate's backers to push out -- and plenty of content for Harris to consume should she so choose.\n\nShapiro spent Friday at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, a historically Black college west of Philadelphia. There, he demonstrated his attack-dog chops, calling Trump a \"coward\" who had made \"offensive\" remarks this past week by falsely questioning Harris' Black identity. The first-term governor also called Vance a \"phony.\"\n\n\"Attacking the identify of the vice president doesn't at all reflect on Vice President Harris, but shows a real insecurity about Donald Trump,\" Shapiro said.\n\nWalz wooed a group of Democratic donors Friday in a remote meeting with the Democracy Alliance, a powerful network of major liberal donors, regaling a packed Zoom meeting with his strategies for winning over rural and working-class voters. He was heading to New Hampshire on Sunday for a series of surrogate events for Harris, including a summer barbecue with the New Hampshire Young Democrats.\n\nKelly spent the final days of the week doing a parade of cable TV hits in which he sought to focus attention on Trump's torpedoing of a border security bill in February -- an issue that Harris has made a focal point of her stump speeches and campaign videos.\n\n\"When Kamala Harris is president, we're going to continue to work on this,\" Kelly said on \"Morning Joe,\" an MSNBC show favored by President Joe Biden and many of the aides who work on the Harris campaign. \"I'm looking forward to seeing Kamala Harris in the White House.\"\n\nButtigieg, a popular news media presence for Democrats, has made the round of cable networks, with dozens of appearances.\n\nOn Sunday, he defended Harris' record on immigration in a heated exchange on Fox News. On Monday, he cracked jokes with Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show.\" On Thursday, he discussed the importance of his appearances on Fox News to reach Republicans, making an appearance that effectively promoted the significance of his other appearances.\n\nAnd Friday, he charmed the ladies of \"The View,\" who had high hopes for his running-mate chances.\n\n\"If offered the position would you accept? Because we'd like that,\" said Ana Navarro, a host of the show.\n\nButtigieg replied with the noncommittal ease of a practiced media star: \"Of course, I'm flattered to be even mentioned in this context,\" he said. \"She's going to make the choice that's right for her, for the ticket, the campaign and of course the country.\"\n\nAt times, Beshear has seemed ubiquitous on television, using his appearances to show how he might challenge Vance.\n\n\"He claims to be from eastern Kentucky, tries to write a book about it to profit off our people, and then he calls us lazy,\" Beshear said recently on CNN.\n\nSen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an admitted Shapiro partisan, said he did not know how the public jockeying might shape Harris' perceptions. But it all amounted to positive advertising, he said, for the eventual ticket.\n\n\"When there's a general sense as to who is in consideration, I think it's natural that people would pay a lot of attention,\" he said. \"The main thing that each of these potential vice-presidential nominees are doing is they're affirming the candidacy of Kamala Harris. They're talking about her plans for the future, what she wants to do if she were elected president, and I think that can only help us win in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_glueck@star-telegram.com", "name": "Katie Glueck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Giffords", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Giffords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker are the other candidates in contention for the job.\n\nHarris' search for a running mate began in earnest just two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov 5 election. Harris' shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters.\n\nOver the weekend, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to multiple sources familiar with the process.\n\nHarris is weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, brother-in-law Tony West and a small circle of aides and advisers, the sources said.\n\nThe candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources added.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, campaign officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters.\n\nSeven cities in five days\n\nOn her battleground states tour, Harris and her new running mate will hit seven cities in five days: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Durham, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Phoenix, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada, said a campaign official, who did not wish to be named.\n\nThey will hold rallies in each location along the tour, which will include college campuses, historically black universities, union halls and restaurants, the official said. Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance will also make a campaign stop in South Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, the Harris campaign launched a program to persuade Republican voters to support the Democrat and showcased endorsements from Republicans including former Trump White House officials Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye.\n\nThe programme, called Republicans for Harris, will hold kickoff events in the battleground states of Arizona, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania on Monday. Republican surrogates will appear at events led by Harris and her yet-to-be-named running mate and combine on the ground organising efforts and paid media to reach Republican voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Harris notched another union endorsement on Monday, with the hospitality workers union praising her as having a longstanding record of delivering for union workers.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Finalists in Pivotal Test of Chemistry", "body": "At least three leading candidates -- Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania -- are scheduled to meet with Ms. Harris on Sunday at her residence at the Naval Observatory, in Washington, according to several people briefed on the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings.\n\nIt was unclear whether other potential candidates -- including Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- were also on the schedule, or if they had already met with Ms. Harris.\n\nThe in-person meeting, described as a \"chemistry test,\" is a final step in the search, but one that Ms. Harris is expected to put considerable stock in. Aides and associates have said that she often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\n\nMs. Harris is also searching for a running mate who will help her win. Among the finalists are two popular state leaders from battleground states, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Shapiro, and several politicians with a record of appealing to moderates and voters in Republican areas. Ms. Harris, a California Democrat, has scant experience winning over Republicans.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the three candidates on her schedule on Sunday vary. Mr. Kelly is a swing-state senator with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and moderate positions on immigration that might help neutralize a problematic issue for Democrats. Mr. Shapiro is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, arguably a must-win state. But he has faced criticism from the left, especially from pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nMr. Walz is a fairly new face, even to most Democrats, but he has recently become a favorite among progressives who relish his folksy takedowns of former President Donald J. Trump on cable news. Minnesota, however, is unlikely to be critical to Ms. Harris's path to the White House.\n\nMs. Harris's search has been unusually accelerated. It began in earnest just two weeks ago, shortly after President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him. The vetting -- a deep investigation of the candidates' personal, financial and political lives -- was completed by Covington & Burling, a Washington law firm, on Thursday.\n\nFinalists for the job were briefed by Harris campaign advisers about whatever information was found -- or not found -- by the firm, according to a person close to one of the finalists. They will be told either Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked.\n\nThe Harris campaign has said it will announce its choice before she and her new running mate start a cross-country tour with a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_rutenberg@nytimes.com", "name": "Jim Rutenberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jonathan_weisman@nytimes.com", "name": "Jonathan Weisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "reid_j_epstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

Aides and associates have said that she often prioritises personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\n\nMs Harris is also searching for a running mate who will help her win. Among the finalists are two popular state leaders from battleground states, Mr Kelly and Mr Shapiro, and several politicians with a record of appealing to moderates and voters in Republican areas. Ms Harris, a California Democrat, has scant experience winning over Republicans.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the three candidates on her schedule on Aug 4 vary.\n\nMr Kelly is a swing-state senator with an impressive resume and moderate positions on immigration that might help neutralise a problematic issue for Democrats.\n\nMr Shapiro is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, arguably a must-win state. But he has faced criticism from the left, especially from pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests over the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nMr Walz is a fairly new face, even to most Democrats, but he has recently become a favourite among progressives who relish his folksy takedowns of former president Donald Trump on cable news. Minnesota, however, is unlikely to be critical to Ms Harris' path to the White House.\n\nMs Harris' search has been unusually accelerated. It began in earnest just two weeks ago, shortly after President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him. The vetting - a deep investigation of the candidates' personal, financial and political lives - was completed by Covington & Burling, a Washington law firm, on Aug 1.\n\nFinalists for the job were briefed by Harris campaign advisers about whatever information was found - or not found - by the firm, according to a person close to one of the finalists. They will be told either on the night of Aug 5 or the morning of Aug 6 whether they were picked.\n\nThe Harris campaign has said it will announce its choice before she and her new running mate start a cross-country tour with a rally in Philadelphia on Aug 6.

Please try again later.\n\nVice President Harris will interview at least two of the finalists to serve as her running mate Sunday in Washington as she moves closer to making her choice, according to multiple people familiar with her plans.\n\nHarris will meet with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. It is unclear how many of the four other finalists -- Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois -- have been invited to meet with Harris. In choosing her running mate, Harris is not solely concerned with electability but is also looking for a governing partner and someone she feels chemistry with, her allies say.\n\nHarris spent Saturday at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where lawyers, led by Eric Holder, the former attorney general, gave presentations on the finalists based on deep examinations of their backgrounds, experience and potential vulnerabilities, a person familiar with the process said. Holder and a team of lawyers at Covington & Burling oversaw the vetting of the officials in contention on an extremely compressed timeline.\n\nPresidential nominees usually take months to select a running mate, but only a few weeks have passed since President Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the likely nominee. Holder and his team finished the process this week after poring over reams of paperwork on the candidates.\n\nHarris will announce her vice-presidential pick by Tuesday, when she and the candidate appear in Philadelphia for the first of seven rallies over the course of five days. The two will campaign in each of the seven most competitive states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nOn Friday, some of the finalists interviewed with Harris's senior staff, including Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, and Sheila Nix, Harris's campaign chief of staff. Harris's campaign also brought on Liz Allen, the current undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs at the State Department, to serve as chief of staff to Harris's running mate. Allen worked as Harris's communications director when she was Biden's running mate on the 2020 ticket.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesman for Harris's campaign, declined to comment on the process, pointing to his previous statement that the campaign does not \"expect to have additional updates until the Vice President announces who will be serving as her running mate.\"\n\nThe finalists are all White men, reflecting an assumption that voters would prefer a White male running mate for the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent leading a major-party presidential ticket. Four years ago, Biden selected Harris amid a sense by many in the Democratic Party that it was important to have a woman and a person of color on the ticket.\n\nSince Harris became the presumptive nominee, her potential running mates have blanketed the airwaves trying to demonstrate how they would be an asset as vice president while also taking shots at Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), former president Donald Trump's running mate, ahead of a potential debate with him should they be selected.\n\nPritzker put out an almost four-minute video on social media to tout his accomplishments as governor while Gabby Giffords, the wife of Kelly, posted a video about their marriage. Allies to Buttigieg, meanwhile, have asked his donors and supporters to make the public case for his bid.\n\nAs Harris wraps up her process, the finalists have had to change their schedules to accommodate interviews. Walz had originally planned to campaign for Harris in New Hampshire on Sunday before canceling the appearance. Teddy Tschann, a spokesman for the governor, said in a statement that Walz's \"schedule has changed\" without providing additional information.\n\nButtigieg, who pulled out of an official stop in Indiana on Friday, attended a fundraiser for Harris in Holderness, N.H., hosted by Gary Hirshberg, the co-founder of Stonyfield Farms, the yogurt maker and dairy company. The fundraiser raised more than $800,000, according to a person familiar who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share financial information.\n\nShapiro pulled out of a weekend fundraising swing in the Hamptons, and Beshear canceled a Friday stop in western Kentucky.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_pager@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Tyler Pager", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

AFP\n\nThe search of Vice President Kamala Harris, the nominee of the Democratic Party, for a running mate is in its final phase.\n\nHarris has been interviewing the finalist vice presidential candidates over the weekend. The law firm Covington & Burling had done the vetting for the campaign.\n\nHarris is understood to have short-listed six candidates to be her running mate. The formal announcement of her pick is expected by Tuesday.\n\nThe six candidates are:\n\nThe choice of the running mate is highly consequential as while the right choice good ensure years of wise counsel and help bring new sets of voters to the campaign, the wrong choice could tank the campaign like Sarah Pallin's selection hurt John McCain's campaign in 2008.\n\nSome of the factors that Harris is considering in picker her running mate are who can help her win by expanding the support base, who shares her values, who she would have a better working relationship with, and who would be best-suited to take over the president in case of a contingency, according to USA Today.\n\nShapiro is the leader of the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. His blue-collar background and sway over the swing state could bolster his chances.\n\nHowever, Shapiro is a Jew who has been overtly supportive of Israel following the attack by Hamas and he has been singled out for it. Amid rampant antisemitism in the United States, which translated into numerous nationwide anti-Israel protests which also defaced national monuments and frequently cheered for Hamas, it has been said that his religious identity may not work in his favour.\n\nThe progressive wing of the Democratic Party remains critical of Israel and it is not known if this wing would approve of Shapiro.\n\nHowever, Shapiro has a reputation of being a tough challenger to Trump. When Trump mounted challenges to his 2020 election loss, Shapiro won against those challenges. He also won the 2022 governor election by a landslide in Pennsylvania -- a state Biden won by a razor-thin margin in 2020.\n\nIf elected, Shapiro would be the first Jewish Vice President of the United States.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg is a former mayor and has served in President Joe Biden's Cabinet for the past four years.\n\nAmong all the contenders, Buttigieg as a member of the Biden administration has the most experience of being around Harris.\n\nIn 2020 when Buttigieg also ran for the presidential nomination before dropping out, he did well amongst white, working class Democrats, according to USA Today.\n\nArizona Sen. Mark Kelly\n\nKelly has an almost picture-perfect resume: a Navy veteran and a former combat pilot, an astronaut who has been to space, a hawk on immigration from a border state, and an advocate of gun safety.\n\nAs Kelly ticks all the right boxes, he has several things going in his favour. Owing to his record on immigration, he could blunt some of the criticism directed at Harris on the issues, which remains her weakest area so far.\n\nKelly won Arizona twice which Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020. He could therefore boost Harris' chances there as well.\n\nAs a two-term senator, Kelly would also bring relationships cultivated in the Congress to the table. To get her legislative agenda cleared, she would need those relationships.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz\n\nWalz, in addition to being a powerhouse by himself, has the support of senior party leader Nancy Pelosi, according to USA Today.\n\nBefore entering politics, Walz served in the Army National Guard and also worked as a teacher and football coach.\n\nWalz served in the Congress for 15 years before becoming the Governor of Minnesota in 2019.\n\nWalz is the only candidate who has both executive and legislative experience and this might appeal to Harris, according to the newspaper.\n\nHowever, Walz is not from any of the swing states that's a must-win for Harris so that may work against him.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker\n\nPritzker is more of a leftist than Harris and may help appeasing the progressive wing of the party, according to USA Today.\n\nPritzker also has a record of advocating for reproductive freedoms, which is central to the Democratic campaign. His advocacy group has helped boost efforts to place and pass proposed constitutional amendments boosting abortion rights in various states, as per the newspaper.\n\nHowever, like Walz, Pritzker is not from any swing state and that may work against him.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\nBeshear, the Governor of the otherwise conservative state of Kentucky, could help bring moderate conservatives and independent voters to Harris who are opposed to Trump, according to USA Today.\n\nLast year, Beshear won the state despite Trump winning it in 2020 by a margin of 26 per cent.\n\nHowever, like in the case of Walz and Pritzker, Kentucky is not a swing state that the Harris campaign is seeking to win.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris",

The two will campaign in each of the seven most competitive states - Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nHarris, who has maintained an aggressive travel schedule since becoming the likely Democratic nominee two weeks ago, spent the weekend in Washington with lawyers and her closest aides.\n\nAt the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory, Harris and her aides reviewed the finalists' backgrounds, experience and potential vulnerabilities. But the in-person interviews, Harris allies said, would be particularly important to the process as the vice president is prioritizing personal chemistry with her running mate, and says she is looking for a governing partner.\n\nThe three finalists who met with Harris on Sunday were Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It remained unclear Sunday whether Harris herself had interviewed three other potential finalists: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nSpokespeople for Shapiro, Walz and Kelly declined to comment on the interviews.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris holed up at her residence. Former attorney general Eric Holder, who led the vetting process, gave presentations that he and a team of lawyers at Covington & Burlington had created on the finalists.\n\nAt the same time, Harris's team was grappling with the fallout from a British tabloid report that her husband, Doug Emhoff, had an affair during his previous marriage, long before he met Harris. Emhoff acknowledged the affair in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" Emhoff said in a statement released to the news media.\n\nPresidential nominees usually take months to select a running mate, but only two weeks have passed since President Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the likely nominee. Holder and his team finished the process this week after poring over reams of paperwork on the candidates.\n\nSince Biden dropped out of the race, supporters and opponents of the vice-presidential contenders have tried to sway Harris and her team.\n\nOne of the most vocal campaigns has come from some liberals who oppose Shapiro in large part because of comments he made about pro-Palestinian protesters earlier this year. Shapiro, who is Jewish, compared some college protesters to the Ku Klux Klan, and encouraged the University of Pennsylvania to break up encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nAn article Shapiro penned about 30 years ago in which he argued that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to establish their own state in the Middle East also resurfaced late last week. During a news conference on Friday, Shapiro said he wrote the article when he was a 20-year-old college student and implied that his views had changed in the years since.\n\nShapiro, a staunch supporter of Israel, said he has been a supporter of a two-state solution, with \"Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side,\" since far before Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which prompted Israel to retaliate with its 10-month-long war in Gaza. He also called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"one of the worst leaders of all time.\"\n\nSeparately, some labor groups have raised concerns about Kelly because of his past opposition to legislation that they argue would make it easier for workers to form unions. But after Biden dropped out, Kelly told reporters he would support the legislation, called the PRO Act, if it reached the Senate floor.\n\nThe finalists are all White men, reflecting an assumption that voters would prefer a White male running mate for the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent leading a major-party presidential ticket. Four years ago, Biden selected Harris amid a sense by many in the Democratic Party that it was important to have a woman and a person of color on the ticket.\n\nEven before selecting a running mate, Harris has already closed much of the polling lead Trump had opened over Biden before the president dropped out of the race. A CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday showed that Harris has a one-point edge nationally against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nThat makes the race a statistical dead heat, but the same poll showed Biden down five points against Trump just before he exited the race. The same poll showed Harris and Trump tied in key battleground states.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_pager@detroitnews.com", "name": "Tyler Pager", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_One_Observatory_Circle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Number One Observatory Circle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The two will campaign in each of the seven most competitive states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nHarris, who has maintained an aggressive travel schedule since becoming the likely Democratic nominee two weeks ago, spent the weekend in Washington with lawyers and her closest aides.\n\nAt the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory, Harris and her aides reviewed the finalists' backgrounds, experience and potential vulnerabilities. But the in-person interviews, Harris allies said, would be particularly important to the process as the vice president is prioritizing personal chemistry with her running mate and says she is looking for a governing partner.\n\nThe three finalists who met with Harris on Sunday were Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It remained unclear Sunday whether Harris herself had interviewed three other potential finalists: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nSpokespeople for Shapiro, Walz and Kelly declined to comment on the interviews.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris holed up at her residence. Former attorney general Eric Holder, who led the vetting process, gave presentations that he and a team of lawyers at Covington & Burlington had created on the finalists.\n\nAt the same time, Harris' team was grappling with the fallout from a British tabloid report that her husband, Doug Emhoff, had an affair during his previous marriage, long before he met Harris. Emhoff acknowledged the affair in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" Emhoff said in a statement released to the news media.\n\nPresidential nominees usually take months to select a running mate, but only two weeks have passed since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the likely nominee. Holder and his team finished the process this week after poring over reams of paperwork on the candidates.\n\nSince Biden dropped out of the race, supporters and opponents of the vice-presidential contenders have tried to sway Harris and her team.\n\nThe finalists are all white men, reflecting an assumption that voters would prefer a white male running mate for the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent leading a major-party presidential ticket. Four years ago, Biden selected Harris amid a sense by many in the Democratic Party that it was important to have a woman and a person of color on the ticket.\n\nEven before selecting a running mate, Harris has already closed much of the polling lead Trump had opened over Biden before the president dropped out of the race. A CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday showed that Harris has a one-point edge nationally against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nThat makes the race a statistical dead heat, but the same poll showed Biden down five points against Trump just before he exited the race.

The decision, anticipated by Monday, will influence the future of the Democratic Party and her campaign against Donald Trump.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates -- Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro -- at her Washington, D.C., residence on Sunday ahead of a final decision on her running mate.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia, Reuters was first to report. The Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters. Harris met with her vetting team on Saturday, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm Covington & Burling LLP scrutinized the finances and background of potential running mates. Holder and his office made in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to sources familiar with the process.\n\nShe met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said. The choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer shortlist includes all white men with a record of winning over rural, white or independent voters. Harris' decision also influences the future direction of the Democratic Party, elevating the chosen candidate to the front of the line for future presidential contests.\n\nShapiro, one of the top contenders, has faced sharp criticism from the left, especially progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests sparked by the war in Gaza. \"There must be a policy correction on Gaza and there must be a pro-working class policy agenda, including a Black agenda,\" said Nina Turner, co-chair of Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign and a fellow at The Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy, a progressive research group. \"Picking Governor Shapiro as a running mate risks closing that door.\"\n\nHis handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a longtime top aide has also been questioned, and labor groups including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, that recently endorsed Harris for president, have criticized him for calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools. Some labor groups have also criticized Kelly for opposing proposed legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union is not supporting Kelly or Shapiro as a potential running mate. Walz has become a favorite of progressives and youth groups who enjoy his attacks on Trump.\n\nAt 60, Walz is just a year older than Harris, but critics say he looks much older, which could be a liability to a campaign that is rebounding from Biden's departure over concerns about his age. Walz responded to this criticism on X, saying he looks the way he does because he was a high school teacher and \"supervised the lunchroom for 20 years. You do not leave that job with a full head of hair.

Now, my mission is serving Arizonans'.\n\nThe 'serving Arizonans' line made many speculate that meant he'd lost his chance to take Harris' former slot on the ticket after he, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota were scheduled for in-person interviews earlier in the day.\n\nHowever, Kelly - a former astronaut - got rid of the post within 30 minutes of publishing and soon replaced it with another.\n\n'Whether it was from my time in the Navy and at NASA, serving in the United States Senate, or visiting our troops overseas: I've learned that when your country asks you to serve, you always answer the call,' he wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for Kelly said that this wasn't meant to suggest anything in his own post later in the evening.\n\nJacob Peters wrote: 'An Arizona senator tweeting about being an Arizona senator is not news! Go back to your Sundays everybody!'\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance with the vice presidential nominee on Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nPages of documents submitted by each of the candidates have been collated by a group of lawyers led by former Attorney General Eric Holder and former White House counsel Dana Remus into briefing books, CNN reports.\n\nThey are currently being waded through by Harris along with the team who will support her VP which has already been selected and includes a former Biden aide.\n\nThe Harris campaign is also planning a social media announcement featuring the duo, officials familiar with the arrangements told Reuters.\n\nThe Vice President and her selection will embark on a battleground tour next week with stops in seven swing states from Pennsylvania to Nevada.\n\nThe short list of candidates reportedly includes Kelly, Shapiro, Walz, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nHarris met with Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday. The candidates will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked, the sources said.\n\nSuggestions have been pouring in from all corners including the likes of former president Barack Obama, which will be taken into considering along with a thorough interview process CNN reports.\n\nAdvice has been flooding in from all corners, including from her government chief of staff Lorraine Voles or her brother-in-law Tony West or campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who helped Biden pick Harris in 2020 - has been weighing in with advice.\n\nThe influence of Harris' husband Doug Emhoff is also said to be heavily underestimated.\n\nHarris reportedly values the way she was welcomed into president Joe Biden's family shortly after her selection and understands the importance of making a personal connection in addition to her typical pragmatic approach.\n\nHarris' decision to kick off the tour in Pennsylvania has triggered speculation that her VP might be Shapiro. Her team insists she is still deciding, but a tweet from Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker appeared to confirm he was the choice.\n\nThe choice of a running mate is one of the most consequential decisions of Harris' political career, as she hastily pulls together a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race last month.\n\nHer

These candidates are Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.\n\nReportedly, she had met Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for 90 minutes on Friday.\n\nThe in-person interview, referred to as a \"chemistry test,\" is the last phase of the search process, but Harris is anticipated to place a great deal of value on it. She frequently prioritises building a personal rapport with her staff and advisers, according to aides and associates.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Harris could make her announcement as early as Monday, ahead of her first public appearance alongside the vice presidential candidate on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Additionally, individuals familiar with the preparations told Reuters that the Harris campaign is preparing a social media statement that will feature the two.\n\nKelly and Shapiro had been considered front-runners during her shortened nomination process, which started with the screening of roughly a dozen names. Some, like Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, who is close to Harris from their time spent together as state solicitors general but has openly withdrawn from consideration, have voiced concerns about frequently travelling outside of the state if Cooper were to be on the national Democratic ticket.\n\nKelly is a senator from a swing state who has a strong background and moderate views on immigration that could help Democrats sidestep a contentious situation.\n\nPennsylvania is arguably a must-win state, where Shapiro has widespread popularity. However, he has come under fire from the left for his backing of Israel and how he handled student protests against the Gaza War, particularly from pro-Palestinian activists.\n\nEven among Democrats, Walz is still relatively a new face, but progressives have recently come to love him for his folksy criticism of former President Donald J. Trump on cable news.\n\nAs President Joe Biden withdrew from the race last month, one of the most important choices Harris will make in her political career is selecting a running partner for her hastily assembled campaign to oppose Donald Trump on November 5.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Friday, President Joe Biden said that he had discussed with Senator Harris her quest for a running partner. However, when questioned about the attributes she ought to consider in a running mate, the president overtly declined.\n\nBefore leaving for the weekend in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden remarked, \"I'll let her work that out,\" on the White House's South Lawn.\n\nPrior to Harris and her new running companion embarking on a cross-country tour with a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the Harris campaign has stated that it will make its announcement.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "litty_simon@ibtimes.com",

Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- were also on the schedule, or if they had already met with Harris.\n\nThe in-person meeting, described as a \"chemistry test,\" is a final step in the search, but one that Harris is expected to put considerable stock in. Aides and associates have said that she often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\n\nHarris is also searching for a running mate who will help her win. Among the finalists are two popular state leaders from battleground states, Kelly and Shapiro, and several politicians with a record of appealing to moderates and voters in Republican areas. Harris, a California Democrat, has scant experience winning over Republicans.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the three candidates on her schedule on Sunday vary. Kelly is a swing-state senator with an impressive resume and moderate positions on immigration that might help neutralize a problematic issue for Democrats. Shapiro is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, arguably a must-win state. But he has faced criticism from the left, especially from pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests over the war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nWalz is a fairly new face, even to most Democrats, but he has recently become a favorite among progressives who relish his folksy takedowns of former President Donald Trump on cable news. Minnesota, however, is unlikely to be critical to Harris' path to the White House.\n\nHarris' search has been unusually accelerated.

Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMordecai Lee, a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Professor Emeritus, says during the complex debate of who should become the pick, the answer could actually be very simple.\n\n\"Anybody who wants to get elected president wants to win Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin,\" Lee said. \"It's just hard-nosed math.\"\n\nLee explained that the Democrats will likely look to win as many electoral votes as possible. Of the important swing staters, Pennsylvania has the most with 19, making Shapiro a choice that Lee believes is obvious.\n\n\"If Harris is thinking, how do I mix things up, how do I gain an advantage by who I pick, and if she's thinking about the electoral college, then she's engaging in addition,\" Lee said. 'When politicians want to win, they want to engage in addition.\"\n\nLee says politicians like Kelly and Walz wouldn't give Harris enough votes in their particular states to win the election in November. However, there are many strong candidates still being considered.\n\n\"They're all qualified to become president in case of an emergency,\" Lee said. \"In that case, if all else is equal, then I'm going to pick the one who will help me get elected president.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is expected to announce her running mate early this week. The nominee will likely face off in a debate against Former President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, in the coming months.\n\nKelly, Shapiro and Walz are expected to have in-person interviews with Harris in Washington D.C. on Sunday, according to multiple sources familiar with the planning. Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media, both in person and virtually, according to a source familiar with the process.\n\nCBS News reports that the Harris campaign has emphasized that no decision has been made yet.

Tim Walz cancels New Hampshire visit as Kamala Harris interviews potential running mates", "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Gov. Tim Walz has canceled his plans to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire this weekend, as Harris interviews a half-dozen potential running mates -- a list believed to include Walz.\n\n\"The governor's schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend,\" Walz's spokesman Teddy Tschann said.\n\nThe vice president's vetting team has been examining prospective running mates in a whirlwind process since President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Harris is interviewing finalists this weekend ahead of an announcement expected early this coming week.\n\nWalz is on Harris' interview list, the Associated Press reports, along with Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nOthers under consideration for the job have also reportedly canceled public appearances this weekend, including Shapiro, adding fuel to the heated speculation around the looming decision.\n\nHarris will hold her first rally with her running mate Tuesday in Philadelphia, her campaign has said, followed by a tour of other battleground states.\n\nWalz had planned to campaign for Harris on Sunday in New Hampshire. He was expected to speak at an event in Manchester with U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas and local Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe Harris campaign's announcement for the event said it would contrast \"Donald Trump's and MAGA Republicans' Project 2025 agenda\" with Harris' and Democrats' \"positive vision that would strengthen our democracy, protect reproductive freedom and ensure every person has the opportunity to not just get by, but to get ahead.\"\n\nWalz's national profile has quickly risen in recent weeks as he has stumped for Harris and landed on her short list. His comments calling Republicans \"weird people \" went viral, giving Harris and Democrats a label they have embraced.\n\n-- -- --\n\n(Staff writer Briana Bierschbach contributed to this report.)\n\n-- -- --\n\n\u00a92024 StarTribune.

Contenders in Final Test of Chemistry", "body": "At least three candidates -- Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania -- are scheduled to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will meet with top candidates to serve as her vice president on Sunday, closing out her search for a running mate with a test of whether she and her potential new partner click.\n\nAt least three leading candidates -- Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania -- are scheduled to meet with Ms. Harris on Sunday at her residence at the Naval Observatory, in Washington, according to several people briefed on the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings.\n\nIt was unclear whether other potential candidates -- including Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- were also on the schedule, or if they had already met with Ms. Harris.\n\nThe in-person meeting, described as a \"chemistry test,\" is a final step in the search, but one that Ms. Harris is expected to put considerable stock in. Aides and associates have said that she often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\n\nMs. Harris is also searching for a running mate who will help her win. Among the finalists are two popular state leaders from battleground states, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Shapiro, and several politicians with a record of appealing to moderates and voters in Republican areas. Ms. Harris, a California Democrat, has scant experience winning over Republicans.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of the three candidates on her schedule on Sunday vary. Mr. Kelly is a swing-state senator with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and moderate positions on immigration that might help neutralize a problematic issue for Democrats. Mr. Shapiro is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, arguably a must-win state. But he has faced criticism from the left, especially from pro-Palestinian activists, over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nMr. Walz is a fairly new face, even to most Democrats, but he has recently become a favorite among progressives who relish his folksy takedowns of former President Donald J. Trump on cable news. Minnesota, however, is unlikely to be critical to Ms. Harris's path to the White House.\n\nMs. Harris's search has been unusually accelerated. It began in earnest just two weeks ago, shortly after President Biden withdrew from the race and endorsed her to replace him. The vetting -- a deep investigation of the candidates' personal, financial and political lives -- was completed by Covington & Burling, a Washington law firm, on Thursday.\n\nFinalists for the job were briefed by Harris campaign advisers about whatever information was found -- or not found -- by the firm, according to a person close to one of the finalists. They will be told either Monday night or Tuesday morning whether they were picked.\n\nThe Harris campaign has said it will announce its choice before she and her new running mate start a cross-country tour with a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_weisman@nytimes.com", "name": "Jonathan Weisman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "reid_j_epstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

Please try again later.\n\nVice President Harris interviewed at least three potential running mates on Sunday as the final hours before her self-imposed deadline to make her choice began ticking away.\n\nHarris will announce her vice-presidential pick by Tuesday night, when she and the candidate will appear in Philadelphia for the first of seven rallies over the course of five days. The two will campaign in each of the seven most competitive states -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nHarris, who has maintained an aggressive travel schedule since becoming the likely Democratic nominee two weeks ago, spent the weekend in Washington with lawyers and her closest aides.\n\nAt the vice president's residence at the Naval Observatory, Harris and her aides reviewed the finalists' backgrounds, experience and potential vulnerabilities. But the in-person interviews, Harris allies said, would be particularly important to the process as the vice president is prioritizing personal chemistry with her running mate, and says she is looking for a governing partner.\n\nThe three finalists who met with Harris on Sunday were Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. It remained unclear Sunday whether Harris herself had interviewed three other potential finalists: Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris holed up at her residence. Former attorney general Eric Holder, who is leading the vetting process, gave presentations that he and a team of lawyers at Covington & Burlington had created on the finalists.\n\nAt the same time, Harris's team was grappling with the fallout from a British tabloid report that her husband, Doug Emhoff, had an affair during his previous marriage, long before he met Harris. Emhoff acknowledged the affair in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,\" Emhoff said in a statement released to the news media.\n\nPresidential nominees usually take months to select a running mate, but only two weeks have passed since President Biden withdrew from the race and Harris became the likely nominee. Holder and his team finished the process this week after poring over reams of paperwork on the candidates.\n\nSome progressives have already begun raising concerns about Shapiro, who is Jewish, as a potential vice-presidential pick, in large part because of comments he made about pro-Palestinian protesters earlier this year. Shapiro compared college protesters to white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, and encouraged the University of Pennsylvania to break up encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nAn article Shapiro penned about 30 years ago in which he argued that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to establish their own state in the Middle East also resurfaced late last week. During a news conference on Friday, Shapiro said he wrote the article when he was a 20-year-old college student and implied that his views had changed in the years since.\n\nShapiro, a staunch supporter of Israel, said he has been a supporter of a two-state solution, with \"Israelis and Palestinians living peacefully side by side,\" since far before Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which prompted Israel to retaliate with its 10-month-long war in Gaza.\n\nThe finalists are all White men, reflecting an assumption that voters would prefer a White male running mate for the first Black woman and the first person of South Asian descent leading a major-party presidential ticket. Four years ago, Biden selected Harris amid a sense by many in the Democratic Party that it was important to have a woman and a person of color on the ticket.\n\nEven before selecting a running mate, Harris has already closed much of the polling lead Trump had opened over Biden before the president dropped out of the race. A CBS News/YouGov poll released on Sunday showed that Harris has a one-point edge nationally against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee.\n\nThat makes the race a statistical dead heat, but the same poll showed Biden down five points against Trump just before he exited the race. The same poll showed Harris and Trump tied in key battleground states.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_pager@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Tyler Pager", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "yasmeen_abutaleb@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Yasmeen Abutaleb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_One_Observatory_Circle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Number One Observatory Circle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nBoth governors are traveling to Washington for an interview with Harris, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. The Washington Post first reported the interviews with Harris' top VP contenders.\n\nHowever, Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media, both in person and virtually, according to a source familiar with the process. Harris herself had a virtual meeting with Mr. Biden when he was interviewing VP candidates. Although that interview was during the pandemic, other candidates had in-person interviews with him at the time.\n\nShapiro is one of the nation's most popular governors and has a 60% approval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. He has won statewide office three times -- twice as state attorney general and once as governor. As Pennsylvania's top law enforcement official, he oversaw the investigation of widespread sexual abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests and a decades-long cover-up by the Catholic church.\n\nWalz, a former congressman, is serving his second term as governor and also has high approval ratings. With Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature during his second term, Walz has enacted a number of progressive priorities, including the protection of abortion access and gender-affirming health care, legalizing recreational marijuana, restricting gun access, providing free school meals to all kids and expanding paid family leave.\n\nAnd Kelly, the junior senator from Arizona, is a political centrist and former astronaut who is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, a gifted politician who was severely injured and left disabled by an assassination attempt in 2011. Kelly and Giffords have become prominent advocates for gun safety and founded a gun control policy organization in her name. Kelly also served in the Navy as a fighter pilot and was a decorated combat veteran before launching a career as an astronaut.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Harris is also interviewing Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, citing two people with knowledge of Harris' selection process.\n\nPresident Biden said Friday he has spoken with Harris about her running mate, but when pressed further on the qualities she should look for in a candidate, he responded, \"I'll let her work that out.\"\n\nHarris is expected to name her vice presidential pick by Tuesday.

Epstein, Lisa Lerer and Katie Glueck NYT News Service/Syndicate Stories\n\nWASHINGTON -- Just in case anyone had forgotten, Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois released a nearly four-minute video this week promoting his accomplishments in office.\n\nIf there were any questions about the home life of Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, his wife, Gabrielle Giffords, resurfaced a testimonial about their loving marriage and posted it to social media.\n\nAnd if someone was wondering about, say, fundraising ability, Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Andy Beshear of Kentucky were scheduled to appear at last-minute simultaneous events Monday afternoon in Minneapolis and Chicago. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was also set to do a fundraiser Saturday night in New Hampshire.\n\nIt is all for an audience of one: Vice President Kamala Harris. As the clock ticks down on her timeline to select a running mate, whom Harris is expected to announce by Tuesday, the men still in contention are doing whatever they can to showcase what they could bring to the ticket and keep themselves in the public eye.\n\nThat thirst has prompted a flood of gauzy videos, cable news appearances, fundraisers and other stops -- Walz will campaign for Harris on Sunday, also in New Hampshire -- serving as a capstone to what has been a two-week sprint toward the first major decision of her presidential campaign. The vetting team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, completed its work Thursday, leaving the choice in Harris' hands after she conducts in-person interviews and spends time deliberating with her advisers.\n\nThe lobbying efforts come as Harris is having to choose a running mate without the typical months to spend time with potential candidates, weighing who would be best as both a political and a governing partner.\n\nPast nominees have used the weeks leading up to their vice presidential announcement as public tryouts, stumping with finalists as a test of camaraderie while spending important time deliberating behind the scenes.\n\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney held campaign events with each of the five finalists to be his running mate before choosing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Romney said Friday that he did not watch any of the TV appearances his potential running mates made during that period.\n\n\"Nope, never saw them on the screen,\" Romney wrote in a text message. \"Went on the trail together. Emphasis was capability if elected, not election impact, which we thought was minimal.\"\n\nUnder this rushed time frame, the auditions have been more diffuse, spaced out across social media, cable television hits and speeches.\n\nWhether those appearances matter to Harris remains unclear. It is not known how much outside content Harris, who planned to be in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, was consuming.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., an early endorser of Harris' previous presidential campaign, suggested that the question of who could draw sharp contrasts with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, former President Donald Trump's running mate, and the Republican ticket as a whole was relevant. But she sounded skeptical of the in-plain-view tryouts.\n\n\"I don't think people talking publicly is going to sway her from her basic decision-making process,\" she said.\n\nIn the meantime, Harris' team has received reams of documents from each of the finalists, and it conducted video interviews this past week.\n\nSome of the top contenders canceled planned events for Friday and Saturday -- when Harris had set aside time to conduct final interviews, according to two people who had been briefed on her schedule but were not authorized to speak publicly about the process. Aides for some of the contenders said they wanted to keep their schedules clear in case Harris' team called.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania canceled a three-event fundraising swing through the Hamptons, and Beshear pulled out of a stop in western Kentucky, prompting a new wave of headlines Thursday.\n\n\"I was going to perform, of course, with Blink-182 on Sunday, but I've canceled in order to clear my schedule,\" joked Pritzker in an interview on MSNBC, referring to the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago this weekend.\n\nBut for the scores of Democratic busybodies and political obsessives who carefully track the process, the prolific public appearances have provided seemingly endless fodder for each candidate's backers to push out -- and plenty of content for Harris to consume should she so choose.\n\nShapiro spent Friday at Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, a historically Black college west of Philadelphia. There, he demonstrated his attack-dog chops, calling Trump a \"coward\" who had made \"offensive\" remarks this past week by falsely questioning Harris' Black identity. The first-term governor also called Vance a \"phony.\"\n\n\"Attacking the identify of the vice president doesn't at all reflect on Vice President Harris, but shows a real insecurity about Donald Trump,\" Shapiro said.\n\nWalz wooed a group of Democratic donors Friday in a remote meeting with the Democracy Alliance, a powerful network of major liberal donors, regaling a packed Zoom meeting with his strategies for winning over rural and working-class voters. He was heading to New Hampshire on Sunday for a series of surrogate events for Harris, including a summer barbecue with the New Hampshire Young Democrats.\n\nKelly spent the final days of the week doing a parade of cable TV hits in which he sought to focus attention on Trump's torpedoing of a border security bill in February -- an issue that Harris has made a focal point of her stump speeches and campaign videos.\n\n\"When Kamala Harris is president, we're going to continue to work on this,\" Kelly said on \"Morning Joe,\" an MSNBC show favored by President Joe Biden and many of the aides who work on the Harris campaign. \"I'm looking forward to seeing Kamala Harris in the White House.\"\n\nButtigieg, a popular news media presence for Democrats, has made the round of cable networks, with dozens of appearances.\n\nOn Sunday, he defended Harris' record on immigration in a heated exchange on Fox News. On Monday, he cracked jokes with Jon Stewart on \"The Daily Show.\" On Thursday, he discussed the importance of his appearances on Fox News to reach Republicans, making an appearance that effectively promoted the significance of his other appearances.\n\nAnd Friday, he charmed the ladies of \"The View,\" who had high hopes for his running-mate chances.\n\n\"If offered the position would you accept? Because we'd like that,\" said Ana Navarro, a host of the show.\n\nButtigieg replied with the noncommittal ease of a practiced media star: \"Of course, I'm flattered to be even mentioned in this context,\" he said. \"She's going to make the choice that's right for her, for the ticket, the campaign and of course the country.\"\n\nAt times, Beshear has seemed ubiquitous on television, using his appearances to show how he might challenge Vance.\n\n\"He claims to be from eastern Kentucky, tries to write a book about it to profit off our people, and then he calls us lazy,\" Beshear said recently on CNN.\n\nSen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an admitted Shapiro partisan, said he did not know how the public jockeying might shape Harris' perceptions. But it all amounted to positive advertising, he said, for the eventual ticket.\n\n\"When there's a general sense as to who is in consideration, I think it's natural that people would pay a lot of attention,\" he said. \"The main thing that each of these potential vice-presidential nominees are doing is they're affirming the candidacy of Kamala Harris. They're talking about her plans for the future, what she wants to do if she were elected president, and I think that can only help us win in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_glueck@miamiherald.com", "name": "Katie Glueck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Giffords", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Giffords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz, people familiar with the search told CNN, even as the vice president continues to weigh whether Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro or Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly would help deliver a victory in their battleground states.\n\nHarris is conducting face-to-face interviews with the final contenders, two sources said, with Walz poised to meet with her on Sunday. She will also interview Shapiro and Kelly on Sunday, according to a source familiar.\n\nIn the final days of the accelerated vice presidential search, after teams of lawyers finished their exhaustive vetting work and preliminary interviews with contenders, Harris was most concerned with what one senior Democrat close to the process described as three Cs: \"competence, chemistry and core values.\"\n\nHarris was weighing the decision with her husband, Doug Emhoff, and a small circle of confidants. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, along with Harris' brother-in-law Tony West, were central advisers throughout the process. West served as a top lieutenant to Holder at the Department of Justice in the Obama administration.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were also said to still be under consideration, people familiar with the process said, with Harris intent on not making her final decision known this weekend or too far in advance of her Tuesday night rally with her running mate in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris was expected to meet with her vetting team Saturday for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists, according to a source familiar with the process. Each briefing was expected to last about 60 to 90 minutes.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the presentations Saturday were expected to reduce the number of candidates whom Harris would invite for final interviews Sunday.\n\nHarris' top consideration is electability, sources familiar with her thinking told CNN.\n\n\"She will be looking at what does a person bring to a ticket? Will it help in battleground states? And will it balance out the ticket?\" one source said.\n\n\"And she will ask questions. She will press and press -- which is her (modus operandi).\"", "source": {"uri": "wishtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WISH-TV | Indianapolis News | Indiana Weather | Indiana Traffic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_zeleny@wishtv.com", "name": "Jeff Zeleny", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/26/AP24207815066103.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9788518", "eventUri": "eng-9788518", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gov. Mark Walz of Minnesota.\n\nBoth governors are traveling to Washington for an interview with Harris, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans. The Washington Post first reported the interviews with Harris' top VP contenders.\n\nHowever, Harris is also having formal interviews with candidates who have not been confirmed in the media, both in person and virtually, according to a source familiar with the process. Harris herself had a virtual meeting with Mr. Biden when he was interviewing VP candidates. Although that interview was during the pandemic, other candidates had in-person interviews with him at the time.\n\nShapiro is one of the nation's most popular governors and has a 60% approval rating, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. He has won statewide office three times -- twice as state attorney general and once as governor. As Pennsylvania's top law enforcement official, he oversaw the investigation of widespread sexual abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests and a decades-long cover-up by the Catholic church.\n\nWalz, a former congressman, is serving his second term as governor and also has high approval ratings. With Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature during his second term, Walz has enacted a number of progressive priorities, including the protection of abortion access and gender-affirming health care, legalizing recreational marijuana, restricting gun access, providing free school meals to all kids and expanding paid family leave.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Harris is also interviewing Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, citing two people with knowledge of Harris' selection process.\n\nPresident Biden said Friday he has spoken with Harris about her running mate, but when pressed further on the qualities she should look for in a candidate, he responded, \"I'll let her work that out.\"\n\nHarris is expected to name her vice presidential pick by Tuesday. She and her running mate will be campaigning together in battleground states this week.\n\nHarris has received a majority of the pledged and automatic delegates in the electronic roll call to secure the Democratic nomination, but voting remains open until Monday.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnipiac_University_Polling_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinnipiac University Polling Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalization_of_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Walz, the Minnesota Governor, has emerged as a popular choice with his folksy style and ties to trade unions. He is a former school teacher who served as a member of the House of Representatives for several terms. He has impressed Democrats also for first using the word \"weird\" for the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, and his campaign, which has been embraced by the Harris campaign and Democrats up and down the party hierarchy.\n\nShapiro, the Pennsylvania Governor, has been seen as the top contender given his popularity in the state, which is a critical state for Harris to win to get to the White House. The two-term state Attorney General won the Governor's race in 2022 by nearly 15 percentage points; Harris currently trails Trump in the state by 2.7 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls.\n\nKelly is also from a key battleground state, Arizona, and could help Harris reach the 270 electoral college votes she needs to make history as the first woman to become US President - Harris trails Trump by 4 percentage points in this state. As a former fighter pilot and astronaut, he brings unique attributes to the ticket. And he is married to former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords who retired from politics after she was nearly killed by a gunman in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

But they didn't get much help from their scheduled guests, none of whom were Democrats connected to the likely choices.\n\nHarris has roughly just 48 hours to go until taking the stage with her pick at a rally in Philadelphia before embarking on a rapid-fire tour of six other swing states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Georgia.\n\nSeveral top contenders have met in recent days with Harris' vetting team, which is being spearheaded by former Attorney General Eric Holder and has had roughly two weeks to comb through candidates' old campaign ads, recent media appearances, years of financial records, family histories and questionnaires submitted to Harris' team.\n\nThree finalists -- Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz -- were to meet Harris at the Naval Observatory on Sunday in face-to-face sitdowns that will likely serve as their final test.\n\nThe candidates, along with others who have been floated as possible picks such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, were notably absent from the airwaves on Sunday, as were most leading Democrats. The figures and lawmakers who did appear offered their two cents as outsiders to the shielded process -- and pundits took a stab at theorizing Harris' pick.\n\n\"My favorite is Andy Beshear from Kentucky. The man stood with us on the picket line. He's been there for workers throughout every bit of our walk,\" United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"I just believe he brings a huge dynamic, and I believe a Harris-Beshear ticket would be unbeatable.\"\n\nFain also offered his praise for Walz, describing him as an \"awesome guy for labor.\" When asked about Shapiro and Kelly, however, he said he saw the governors' respective records on school vouchers and the PRO Act as an issue.\n\nShapiro and Kelly, both moderates from key battlegrounds, have risen as favorites among those who see a priority in securing their states' electoral votes. Walz has begun building a national profile for himself by making his rounds on TV and appealing to Democrats across the spectrum -- all while the candidates have faced public scrutiny.\n\nLast week, Kelly said he would support the PRO Act, a pro-union legislation co-sponsored by most Senate Democrats, after organized labor circles raised concerns over his initial lack of support amid VP speculation. Even with the backing of several Philadelphia unions, Shapiro's record on private school vouchers has been unpopular among some teachers unions in his own state. And, his comments on Israel have angered some on the party's left flank.\n\nMeanwhile, some have criticized Walz as too progressive and see his state as less competitive and therefore not as valuable to the ticket.\n\nOn ABC's \"This Week,\" Donna Brazile, a political strategist who served twice as acting Chair of the Democratic National Committee, revealed she had a \"couple of favorites\" but declined to provide any specific endorsement. Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, however, went all in on Shapiro.\n\nHe said he believed Harris should select someone who is more moderate than her and has governing experience at the ground level.\n\n\"It should be Josh Shapiro. I don't think this is a hard choice. He's a very talented politician. He's extraordinarily popular, 65 percent job approval in a state she needs to win,\" Christie said, adding, \"If she picks Shapiro on Tuesday, Donald Trump created Josh Shapiro.\"\n\nChristie, who opposed Trump in the 2024 primaries, cited the fact that in the Pennsylvania governor race in 2022, Trump endorsed state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who he described as the \"weakest Republican candidate in that field.\" This allowed Shapiro to get a leg up on Mastriano and seize the opportunity for a \"coalition-building election,\" Christie said. Shapiro won by 15 percentage points.\n\nCNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten said the numbers are also tilting in Shapiro's favor, although he clarified that vice presidential nominees historically have a minimal effect on voters. He pointed to one measurable, yet small, effect: home state advantage.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if you're a Democrat that adds half a point or a point to your margin in a state that Joe Biden won last time around by 1.2 points? That's the math that Harris is dealing with right now,\" Enten said on \"Inside Politics.\" \"Of course, we'll see if she's doing the same math I am or she's just in a completely different equation.\"\n\nGeoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, said in a panel on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Harris has \"de-risked\" her finalist list and removed all potential liability: \"There's no chance of her doing a JD Vance selection.\" Speaking about his party, he highlighted that Republicans would be most threatened to see Shapiro as a near guarantee of Pennsylvania for the Democrats.\n\nBut commentator Shermichael Singleton pushed back on Shapiro as the best pick, expressing concerns that Muslim voters in Michigan and younger progressives would be critical of his previous statements about Palestinians and Israel.\n\nPOLITICO reported Saturday that one of Shapiro's Democratic rivals in his state, Sen. John Fetterman, is concerned about Harris picking the Pennsylvania governor and his advisers have relayed those worries to Harris. Fetterman's advisers told the vice president's team that Shapiro is too focused on his personal ambitions, people familiar with the conversations said.\n\nHarris is expected to make her choice as soon as Monday -- and in the meantime, the rumor mill will continue to run rampant. Democrats' hunger for clues spiraled earlier this week when several contenders switched up their weekend schedules last minute, with Shapiro backing out of a fundraising swing through the Hamptons, Buttigieg cutting short a trip to Indiana and Beshear canceling a scheduled visit to a distillery in Kentucky.\n\nA Harris campaign aide previously cautioned against reading too much into the first city of the vice president's VP tour in the capital of Shapiro's home state. Beyond defeating Trump, Harris is reported to be prioritizing selecting someone she sees as a strong governing partner.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

The New York Times says Harris is holding a series of meetings with potential running mates at the vice president's official residence in Washington, D.C., on Sunday.\n\nIt said \"several people\" briefed on the planning confirmed she would meet the three frontrunners: Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota.\n\nThe newspaper added: \"It was unclear whether other potential candidates -- including Gov.

Andy Beshear?", "body": "The clock is ticking.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has just two days to decide who she wants to be her running mate.\n\nThere's a lot to consider, and she and her team may still be evaluating Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nIn the two weeks since President Joe Biden stepped aside in his reelection campaign and threw his support behind Harris, the 46-year-old Kentucky governor's name has been bandied about to run alongside Harris in her bid for the White House this November.\n\nBut in the latest breaking news from the New York Times and other outlets Saturday night and Sunday, the list of three candidates confirmed to have been meeting in-person with Harris Sunday does not include Beshear.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly have been reported by multiple outlets to have meetings scheduled with Harris Sunday.\n\nHowever, the reports don't exclude the possibility that Beshear met with Harris that day as well, or earlier on Saturday.\n\nBeshear was in Kentucky Saturday night and Sunday morning. He posted to X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, photos of he and his son attending a Savannah Bananas baseball game in Louisville Saturday and at a Frankfort church service 10:45 a.m. Sunday.\n\nThe governor was on the widely reported list of six finalists, all white men, for the role. Aside from the aforementioned officials, the list also included Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThere's still loud support for Beshear among some of the most influential figures among Democrats.\n\nHere's a roundup of the latest on the so-called \"veepstakes.\"\n\n-- Beshear got a second boost on Sunday, when powerful labor leader Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers union, once again backed Beshear on national television. Appearing on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Fain said that Beshear was his \"favorite,\" of all the VP contenders and that he believes a Harris-Beshear ticket \"would be unbeatable.\"\n\n-- The New York Times reported Sunday that Walz, Kelly and Shapiro would meet with Harris that day at her residence in Washington, \"according to several people briefed on the plans.\"\n\n-- A CBS News reporter later said that a source informed them to \"not to make too much of who has in-person interviews with (Harris) today, as she is talking to others who have not been confirmed in the public.\"\n\n-- Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, who is still influential in the capital, is reportedly keen on Walz as Harris' vice presidential pick, according to The Hill. The outlet reports a source saying she \"is always especially fond of former House colleagues.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a former presidential contender and popular figure on the left, also signaled support for Walz.\n\n-- While many believe and have believed that Shapiro is the favorite to become Harris' running mate given the importance of Pennsylvania to the electoral college map, reports have surfaced of Shapiro's college-age statements about Palestine. He wrote more than 30 years ago that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" and \"peace between Arabs and Israelis is virtually impossible and will never come,\" words that have drawn criticism from the left given that the Israel-Palestine conflict is a matter that divides many Democrats. Shapiro said the writing does not represent his views now.\n\n-- Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has privately relayed concerns about Shapiro to Harris' team, reflecting a long-running rivalry between the two Keystone State politicians, Politico reported.\n\nHarris and her new VP nominee are to make a campaign appearance Tuesday evening in Philadelphia. Beshear is scheduled to lead a Democratic fundraiser in Chicago Monday.\n\n\u00a92024 Lexington Herald-Leader. Visit kentucky.com.

The meetings were complete by Sunday evening, an official familiar with the process said.\n\nThe three people are on a so-called short list of possible vice presidential candidates, people familiar with the process said. To be sure, Harris also spoke with other contenders, just not in person, the people said.\n\nHarris' entrance has overhauled the dynamics of the presidential campaign. She has quickly raised more than $300 million and has erased some of the lead that former President Donald Trump held in national polls. Her vice presidential pick could determine whether that momentum continues to propel her or simmers down as Election Day approaches.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker are among the other names floated to join Harris on the ticket.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee plans to virtually nominate a ticket by Aug. 7, indicating that Harris' vice presidential selection is expected to come by then as well. The party said Aug. 2 that she had secured enough delegate votes to win the nomination, while the balloting is open until Monday.\n\nHarris plans to kick off a tour of seven battleground states next week, with her running mate slated to join her Aug. 6 in Philadelphia.\n\nMost of Harris' vice presidential contenders fit a certain profile: White, male and centrist. Her pick could boost appeal to swing-state voters, while simultaneously detracting from Republican attacks calling her a \"California liberal.\"\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain made a pitch for his favored choice, Beshear, who joined striking UAW workers outside a Ford Motor Co. plant in Louisville, Kentucky, last year. \"I believe the Harris and Beshear ticket would be unbeatable,\" Fain said Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation. He also spoke highly of Walz.\n\nShapiro met with Harris' representatives on July 31, though it was unclear whether the interaction was virtual or in person.\n\n--With assistance from Tony Czuczka.\n\n(Updates with completion of meetings starting in first paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Biden also endorsed Harris the day he withdrew from the race and she is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nThe sudden change in Walz's schedule comes as Harris is reportedly in the final stages of vetting candidates in her search for a running mate.\n\nCNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote on X, formerly Twitter, about Walz's change in travel plans: \"A little more veepstakes NEWS: from Tim Walz's spokesman: 'The governor's schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to New Hampshire this weekend.'\"\n\nHarris is expected to meet with her vetting team today for a series of in-depth presentations on each of the finalists. These briefings, lasting between 60 to 90 minutes each, are designed to provide Harris with comprehensive information on the candidates' backgrounds, qualifications, and potential impact on the ticket.\n\nThe list of finalists reportedly includes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, alongside Walz.\n\nThe presentations may result in a narrowing of the field, with Harris expected to conduct final interviews, possibly in-person on Sunday, according to CNN.\n\nNewsweek has contacted the Harris campaign and Walz's press office via email on Saturday for comment.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose law firm is conducting the vetting process, was seen arriving at the Naval Observatory on Saturday morning, underscoring the high-stakes nature of these deliberations.\n\nWalz, a former high school teacher and football coach with a 24-year career in the Army National Guard, brings a unique blend of experiences to the table. As a congressman, he represented a deep-red district in Minnesota, demonstrating an ability to appeal to voters across the political spectrum. His background in education, military service, and agriculture could potentially resonate with voters in key battleground states, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nIn a recent op-ed for Newsweek, former Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat, made a case for Walz as Harris' running mate. Ryan emphasized the importance of selecting a candidate who can connect with working-class voters, particularly in the Rust Belt. He highlighted Walz's understanding of issues critical to Midwestern voters, such as job creation, health care access, and education.\n\nThe timing of Walz's schedule change is particularly noteworthy, mirroring a similar move by Shapiro who recently canceled a fundraising trip to the Hamptons in New York. These parallel developments have intensified the buzz around both governors as potential VP picks.\n\nHarris' top consideration in selecting a running mate is reportedly electability. The choice will not only impact the campaign's strategy, but also signal the Democratic Party's priorities and vision for the future.\n\nWith Harris expected to announce her running mate before a planned campaign rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday, the political world is on high alert for any further schedule changes or announcements from the potential VP candidates.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adeola_adeosun@newsweek.com", "name": "Adeola Adeosun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The candidates include Minnesota governor Tim Walz, US senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nAccording to a report from Reuters, Harris is expected to make her decision public as early as Monday, with a social media announcement featuring the chosen candidate planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nOn Saturday, Harris met with her vetting team, including former attorney general Eric Holder, whose law firm provided detailed presentations on each of the finalists. She also held a 90-minute meeting with transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg on Friday and has been conducting virtual meetings with other candidates, including Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Illinois governor J B Pritzker.\n\nThe selection of a running mate is a crucial decision for Harris as she quickly assembles a campaign to challenge Donald Trump in the November 5 election following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race last month. Her shortlist consists entirely of white men known for appealing to rural, white, or independent voters, and her choice will have an impact on the future direction of the Democratic Party.\n\nGovernor Shapiro, a top contender, has faced criticism from progressive groups and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and his handling of college protests related to the Gaza war. Some argue that selecting Shapiro as a running mate could hinder progress on issues such as Gaza policy and a pro-working class agenda.\n\nAdditionally, his handling of a sexual harassment complaint against a top aide and his support for voucher programs that direct public funds to private schools have drawn criticism from labour groups, including the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.\n\nSenator Kelly has also faced criticism from labour groups for not supporting proposed legislation that they believe would strengthen union organising. Despite endorsing Harris for president, the UAW has said that it does not support either Kelly or Shapiro as potential running mates.\n\nGovernor Walz, at 60 years old, has become a favourite among progressives and youth groups who appreciate his attacks on Trump. However, some critics argue that he appears much older than Harris, which could be a disadvantage for a campaign recovering from concerns about Biden's age. Walz addressed this criticism on X, attributing his appearance to his 20-year career as a high school teacher and lunchroom supervisor.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz -- were to meet Harris at the Naval Observatory on Sunday in face-to-face sitdowns that will likely serve as their final test.\n\nThe candidates, along with others who have been floated as possible picks such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, were notably absent from the airwaves on Sunday, as were most leading Democrats. The figures and lawmakers who did appear offered their two cents as outsiders to the shielded process -- and pundits took a stab at theorizing Harris' pick.\n\n\"My favorite is Andy Beshear from Kentucky. The man stood with us on the picket line. He's been there for workers throughout every bit of our walk,\" United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"I just believe he brings a huge dynamic, and I believe a Harris-Beshear ticket would be unbeatable.\"\n\nFain also offered his praise for Walz, describing him as an \"awesome guy for labor.\" When asked about Shapiro and Kelly, however, he said he saw the governors' respective records on school vouchers and the PRO Act as an issue.\n\nShapiro and Kelly, both moderates from key battlegrounds, have risen as favorites among those who see a priority in securing their states' electoral votes. Walz has begun building a national profile for himself by making his rounds on TV and appealing to Democrats across the spectrum -- all while the candidates have faced public scrutiny.\n\nLast week, Kelly said he would support the PRO Act, a pro-union legislation co-sponsored by most Senate Democrats, after organized labor circles raised concerns over his initial lack of support amid VP speculation. Even with the backing of several Philadelphia unions, Shapiro's record on private school vouchers has been unpopular among some teachers unions in his own state. And, his comments on Israel have angered some on the party's left flank.\n\nMeanwhile, some have criticized Walz as too progressive and see his state as less competitive and therefore not as valuable to the ticket.\n\nOn ABC's \"This Week,\" Donna Brazile, a political strategist who served twice as acting Chair of the Democratic National Committee, revealed she had a \"couple of favorites\" but declined to provide any specific endorsement. Former Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, however, went all in on Shapiro.\n\nHe said he believed Harris should select someone who is more moderate than her and has governing experience at the ground level.\n\n\"It should be Josh Shapiro. I don't think this is a hard choice. He's a very talented politician. He's extraordinarily popular, 65 percent job approval in a state she needs to win,\" Christie said, adding, \"If she picks Shapiro on Tuesday, Donald Trump created Josh Shapiro.\"\n\nChristie, who opposed Trump in the 2024 primaries, cited the fact that in the Pennsylvania governor race in 2022, Trump endorsed state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who he described as the \"weakest Republican candidate in that field.\" This allowed Shapiro to get a leg up on Mastriano and seize the opportunity for a \"coalition-building election,\" Christie said. Shapiro won by 15 percentage points.\n\nCNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten said the numbers are also tilting in Shapiro's favor, although he clarified that vice presidential nominees historically have a minimal effect on voters. He pointed to one measurable, yet small, effect: home state advantage.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be nice if you're a Democrat that adds half a point or a point to your margin in a state that Joe Biden won last time around by 1.2 points? That's the math that Harris is dealing with right now,\" Enten said on \"Inside Politics.\" \"Of course, we'll see if she's doing the same math I am or she's just in a completely different equation.\"\n\nGeoff Duncan, the former Republican lieutenant governor of Georgia, said in a panel on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Harris has \"de-risked\" her finalist list and removed all potential liability: \"There's no chance of her doing a JD Vance selection.\" Speaking about his party, he highlighted that Republicans would be most threatened to see Shapiro as a near guarantee of Pennsylvania for the Democrats.\n\nBut commentator Shermichael Singleton pushed back on Shapiro as the best pick, expressing concerns that Muslim voters in Michigan and younger progressives would be critical of his previous statements about Palestinians and Israel.\n\nPOLITICO reported Saturday that one of Shapiro's Democratic rivals in his state, Sen. John Fetterman, is concerned about Harris picking the Pennsylvania governor and his advisers have relayed those worries to Harris. Fetterman's advisers told the vice president's team that Shapiro is too focused on his personal ambitions, people familiar with the conversations said.\n\nHarris is expected to make her choice as soon as Monday -- and in the meantime, the rumor mill will continue to run rampant. Democrats' hunger for clues spiraled earlier this week when several contenders switched up their weekend schedules last minute, with Shapiro backing out of a fundraising swing through the Hamptons, Buttigieg cutting short a trip to Indiana and Beshear canceling a scheduled visit to a distillery in Kentucky.\n\nA Harris campaign aide previously cautioned against reading too much into the first city of the vice president's VP tour in the capital of Shapiro's home state. Beyond defeating Trump, Harris is reported to be prioritizing selecting someone she sees as a strong governing partner.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"},

It will be a critical week for Harris, who is rushing to introduce herself to voters with just three months until Election Day. It will also be the first time she will appear with her yet-to-be-announced running mate.\n\nStarting Tuesday, Harris will campaign across seven swing states over five days, one of the heaviest weeks of campaign-related travel in the general election. Her team has vetted six contenders to be her running mate: Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nWalz, Shapiro and Kelly each met separately with Harris on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the meetings. Harris is set to appear alongside her running mate for the first time Tuesday in Philadelphia, where the pair will kick off the cross-country tour.\n\nHer travel swing is a stark contrast to the pace of Trump and President Joe Biden. Trump has delivered remarks in 10 states since the June 27 debate, while Biden traveled to campaign stops in eight states during the final 24 days of his candidacy. Harris' travel this week will take her to seven states in less than a fourth of the time.\n\nRead more: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-seven-state-campaign-blitz-vp-pick-rcna164744", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

She has quickly raised more than $300 million and has erased some of the lead that former President Donald Trump held in national polls. Her vice presidential pick could determine whether that momentum continues to propel her or simmers down as Election Day approaches.\n\nKentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker are among the other names floated to join Harris on the ticket.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee plans to virtually nominate a ticket by Aug. 7, indicating that Harris' vice presidential selection is expected to come by then as well. The party said Friday that she had secured enough delegate votes to win the nomination, while the balloting is open until Monday.\n\nHarris plans to kick off a tour of seven battleground states this week, with her running mate slated to join her Aug. 6 in Philadelphia.\n\nMost of Harris' vice presidential contenders fit a certain profile: White, male and centrist. Her pick could boost appeal to swing-state voters, while simultaneously detracting from Republican attacks calling her a \"California liberal.\"\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain made a pitch for his favored choice, Beshear, who joined striking UAW workers outside a Ford Motor Co. plant in Louisville, Kentucky, last year. \"I believe the Harris and Beshear ticket would be unbeatable,\" Fain said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" He also spoke highly of Walz.\n\nShapiro met with Harris' representatives on July 31, though it was unclear whether the interaction was virtual or in-person.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alicia_diaz@kansas.com", "name": "Alicia Diaz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "josh_wingrove@kansas.com", "name": "Josh Wingrove", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Who's going to be Kamala Harris' running mate - Times of India", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris will interview three top candidates for her running mate at her Washington, DC, home on Sunday. The candidates are Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, US Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Harris is expected to announce her choice by Monday, with a social media reveal planned for Tuesday in Philadelphia.\n\nHarris met with her team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, who reviewed each candidate's background.She also had a meeting with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The selected candidate will be informed on Monday night or Tuesday morning.\n\nThis choice is important for Harris as she prepares to run against Donald Trump in the November 5 election after President Biden withdrew. Her shortlist includes only white men who are seen as able to attract key voter groups. The choice will also impact the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nHere is all you need to know about the Vice-presidential candidates:\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, has recently gained attention as a possible running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. Walz, who used to be a high school teacher and a National Guard member, has been visible in supporting Harris and making appearances on major news channels. A notable moment was when he appeared at a St. Paul event in a grey T-shirt and camouflage hat, which went viral.\n\nAlthough Walz hasn't confirmed if he's received vetting materials from Harris's team, he's grateful for the consideration. Political analyst David Schultz notes that Walz's rise as a candidate is surprising, given his previous low profile.\n\nWhile Walz's support among progressives and youth is strong, some critics are concerned that his age might be a disadvantage, as he is close in age to Harris and recent debates have focused on Biden's age.\n\nUS Senator Mark Kelly\n\nMark Kelly, a US Senator from Arizona, is considered a strong candidate for Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. Kelly's background as a Navy pilot and astronaut, along with his work on gun control with his wife Gabrielle Giffords, makes him stand out.\n\nHe first won his Senate seat in a special election against Republican Martha McSally and was re-elected in 2024. Kelly's centrist approach helps him appeal to a broad range of voters, which could be beneficial in swing states like Arizona.\n\nHowever, some progressives may criticize his centrist stance and his views on labour issues, which could affect his appeal within the Democratic Party. Kelly is criticised by labour groups for opposing union-friendly legislation.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is a top candidate for Kamala Harris's vice-presidential pick due to his strong performance and high approval ratings. At 51, Shapiro has held several important roles, including state representative, Montgomery County Board Chair, Attorney General, and now Governor.\n\nHis victory in the gubernatorial race against a Trump-backed Republican and high approval ratings make him a strong contender, especially in the key state of Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite his success, Shapiro faces criticism from some progressives who are concerned about his decisions on issues like school choice and the environment. These critics worry that choosing Shapiro could cause problems for the Democratic ticket, even though they recognize his contributions to the party.\n\nShapiro has faced criticism from progressives and pro-Palestinian activists over his support for Israel and handling of college protests related to Gaza. His support for private school vouchers and handling of a sexual harassment complaint have also been questioned.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

As Pennsylvania Gov Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen Mark Kelly have emerged as among the potential finalists, both have faced criticism from some organisations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHarris's team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected on Monday.

In addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov Tim Walz, Illinois Gov J B Pritzker and Gov Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico. They say his selection could help defuse attacks by the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who argues that Biden administration's immigration policies are too relaxed. Shapiro has high-profile supporters, too, including Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as her running mate.\n\nDonald Trump says he is pulling out of a September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris on ABC and wants them to face off on Fox News, making it increasingly unlikely that the candidates will confront each other on stage before the November election.

Josh Shapiro, who has drawn opposition from progressives and even a senator in his home state.\n\nThe fissures among Democrats emerged as three leading contenders -- Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz -- met with Harris at her residence in Washington on Sunday, before a decision that her campaign said would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, declined to comment on the Sunday meetings.\n\nHarris is set to hit the campaign trail with her running mate this week, kicking off a five-day, seven-state tour with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia, where Shapiro is expected to be in attendance, whether he is her pick or not.\n\nProgressive groups have trained their criticisms on Shapiro and Kelly, whom they accuse of being too conservative on key issues. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said during a Sunday interview on CBS that Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged the union's concerns about his commitment to pro-labor legislation and that the organization had \"bigger issues\" with Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signaled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Harris' list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, has come out against Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on the Israel-Hamas war. The debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organizer called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Walz, who has become a favorite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed Friday.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about the war. \"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labor,\" he wrote in an email thread, which was shared with The New York Times. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has long clashed with Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Shapiro, a development first reported by Politico.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, declined to comment on the vice presidential selection process.\n\nThe growing attacks on Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" issued a forceful defense of the Pennsylvania governor on the social platform X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade.\"\n\nA group of progressive donors in recent days has been making a push for Walz. Over the past week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Wimsatt have circulated a memo called \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President,\" hoping to sway Harris.\n\nA similar document touting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who headlined a Harris fundraiser in New Hampshire on Saturday, was circulated last week to Democrats, including major donors.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nKelly's spokesperson, Jacob Peters, said the post was deleted because it was being misunderstood.\n\nShapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favorite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has fans among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee. Beshear has spent time over the past two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors who have been eager to kick the tires on him, including an invite-only session Friday evening, according to two people briefed on his activities.\n\nBeshear was not known to have participated in Harris' final interviews Sunday, but he was spotted with his labradoodle, Winnie, outside the governor's residency in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\n\"Just walking the dog this morning,\" Beshear responded when asked about his plans for the day.\n\nWalz and Beshear are set to appear at dueling, simultaneous fundraisers to benefit Harris on Monday evening. Walz's event, in Minneapolis, was sold out as of Sunday evening; tickets remained available for Beshear's event, which will be in Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

It needs to be progressive.", "body": "She's also close to making her decision on who will win the veepstakes. It's a decision that could continue her presidential campaign's momentum. Harris is supposed to announce her running mate before a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. There's no official short list, but a handful of candidates across the country are in the process of being vetted.\n\nWhoever Harris picks will determine whether the campaign leans into her more progressive stances or tries to appeal to moderates in the party. As someone who wants to see the Dems move toward the future, I hope her eventual pick is someone with whom she can champion bold, progressive ideas.\n\nDemocrats are at an inflection point. If they really intend to move the party forward - and win over young, disaffected voters in the process - they can set themselves up for success in November. Given the enthusiasm she's earned over the past few weeks, I think it's time for the Democratic Party to embrace change and, for once, try something other than appealing to the middle.\n\nWe'll know soon enough what Harris wants.\n\nProgressives want Kamala Harris to pick Tim Walz\n\nFor progressive voters, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is someone to be excited about. It even seems that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is a fan.\n\nLast year, with a Democratic majority in both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature, Walz codified the right to abortion into law, signed off on universal free school meals, legalized recreational marijuana and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nNot to mention, he's the one who started the recent phenomenon of calling Republicans \"weird.\"\n\nWho will Harris pick for VP? Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.\n\nChoosing Walz would be an inspired choice that would solidify Harris' standing with progressives, and his Midwestern sensibilities would be perfect for taking on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nHe's also the strongest choice when it comes to abortion rights, an issue that the Harris campaign is putting at the forefront. If Harris picks Walz, it will signal to the rest of the party that the younger faction is determined to be more progressive than the current iteration of the party.\n\nAndy Beshear is a middle-of-the-road choice\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is another option that could take on Vance and mobilize a part of the country Democrats traditionally struggle with. Beshear has done what he could as a Democratic governor in a red state and won reelection by focusing on the abortion rights battle. Like Walz, he reinstated voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nWhile Beshear isn't where progressives want him to be on abortion - he often chooses to emphasize the most extreme reasons for needing one, and his lieutenant governor pick has described herself as pro-life - he proved that reproductive freedom is a winning issue for Democrats no matter the state.\n\nMark Kelly would complement Harris, but he isn't progressive enough\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is, according to multiple polls, the most well-known of Harris' short list. The former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who suffered a head injury in a 2011 mass shooting, is a vocal supporter of commonsense gun laws. He's also taken Trump to task over the failed bipartisan immigration reform bill from earlier this year.\n\nOn the other hand, Kelly failed to co-sponsor a crucial piece of legislation that would have made it easier for workers to unionize - that is, until he was added to the VP short list.\n\nOf all the candidates, Kelly is the one I'm most on the fence about. His strength on the border complements Harris' shortfalls, but his failure to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act is definitely disappointing. He'd be a fine choice, but not someone I'd be ecstatic over.\n\nTrump does love racism: Trump's lazy racism against Harris won't earn him votes. He already has racists in the bag.\n\nChoosing Josh Shapiro signals an attempt to compromise\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has been criticized for his response to the pro-Palestinian protests earlier this year.\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, has said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a \"terrible leader\" but has also compared some pro-Palestinian protesters to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nUnfortunately, those aren't the only issues with the Pennsylvania governor. He's also a supporter of school choice voucher programs - a traditionally conservative idea. He's also been accused by some in his home state of staying silent on a sexual harassment investigation last year of a former aide.\n\nOn the other hand, Shapiro could help Democrats win Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states this election cycle. Picking him would be a sign that the party is still trying to appeal to centrists instead of being bold. As someone invested in this country's future, I would find that disappointing.\n\nThen there is the VP candidate who will never be \u2639\n\nApropos of political leanings, I am still a little sad that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper withdrew his name from the veepstakes. Cooper may not be particularly progressive, but he has a moderate liberal record that I think would do well with the majority of Americans.\n\nSadly, it means that the rest of the country will lose out on seeing the Andy Griffith costume Cooper wears on Halloween - but it probably means he's eyeing a 2026 Senate run.\n\nHarris doesn't need to ruin the momentum she has built in the early days of her presidential campaign. She's already garnering enough support to pull ahead of the polls and make up for lost time. Democrats should pick someone who is thinking about the future of the party and the future of the country.\n\nHarris needs to keep rallying her base and energizing young voters. The wrong choice could haunt her on Election Day.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Josh Shapiro, who has drawn opposition from progressives and even a senator in his home state.\n\nThe fissures among Democrats emerged as three leading contenders -- Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz -- met with Harris at her residence in Washington on Sunday, before a decision that her campaign said would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, declined to comment on the Sunday meetings.\n\nHarris is set to hit the campaign trail with her running mate this week, kicking off a five-day, seven-state tour with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia, where Shapiro is expected to be in attendance, whether he is her pick or not.\n\nProgressive groups have trained their criticisms on Shapiro and Kelly, whom they accuse of being too conservative on key issues. Shawn Fain, head of the United Autoworkers Union, said during a Sunday interview on CBS that Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged the union's concerns about his commitment to pro-labor legislation and that the organization had \"bigger issues\" with Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signaled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Harris' list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, has come out against Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on the Israel-Hamas war. The debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organizer called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Walz, who has become a favorite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed Friday.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about the war. \"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labor,\" he wrote in an email thread, which was shared with The New York Times. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has long clashed with Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Shapiro, a development first reported by Politico.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, declined to comment on the vice presidential selection process.\n\nThe growing attacks on Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" issued a forceful defense of the Pennsylvania governor on the social platform X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade.\"\n\nA group of progressive donors in recent days has been making a push for Walz. Over the past week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Wimsatt have circulated a memo called \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President,\" hoping to sway Harris.\n\nA similar document touting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who headlined a Harris fundraiser in New Hampshire on Saturday, was circulated last week to Democrats, including major donors.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nKelly's spokesperson, Jacob Peters, said the post was deleted because it was being misunderstood.\n\nShapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favorite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has fans among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee. Beshear has spent time over the past two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors who have been eager to kick the tires on him, including an invite-only session Friday evening, according to two people briefed on his activities.\n\nBeshear was not known to have participated in Harris' final interviews Sunday, but he was spotted with his labradoodle, Winnie, outside the governor's residency in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\n\"Just walking the dog this morning,\" Beshear responded when asked about his plans for the day.\n\nWalz and Beshear are set to appear at dueling, simultaneous fundraisers to benefit Harris on Monday evening in Minneapolis and Chicago, respectively. Walz's event was sold out as of Sunday evening; tickets remained available for Beshear's event.\n\nBy that point, Harris' decision is likely to already have been made.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reid_j_epstein@seattletimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nHarris on Friday officially secured the nomination of the Democratic Party by garnering a sufficient number of delegates during online voting that began Thursday, according to multiple reports citing comments made by Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison during a phone call with Harris supporters.\n\nThe vote cemented Harris' unprecedented rise from four up-and-down years as vice president to the near-unanimous pick to replace President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket -- all in less than two weeks.\n\n\"Today, my friends, is special, because we can proudly say we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket,\" Harrison said, while Harris herself joined the call and added, \"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.\n\n\"I would not be on this call right now and with you all were it not for your support and your trust, for which I am deeply grateful,\" she said.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice for vice president by Tuesday, when the candidate and her newly minted running mate are scheduled to hold their first rally together in Philadelphia, the largest city in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, according to campaign sources cited by Politico.\n\nThe team will then proceed to stops in western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, S.C., Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThe six likely finalists each bring possible strengths and weaknesses to the Democratic ticket. Here's a more detailed look at each.\n\nBeshear: The conventional wisdom that a vice presidential nominee could help a ticket win his or her home state would be out the window should Harris pick Beshear -- Donald Trump cruised to a 26-point victory in Kentucky four years ago and it remains highly unlikely the state will turn blue anytime soon. But the governor's status as a well-liked Democratic winner in an overwhelmingly Republican southern state could be a powerful incentive to add him to the ticket.\n\nHis proven ability to attract moderate or even conservative voters in rural and suburban areas who may not normally opt for Democrats, as well as his record of expanding health care services and fighting for voting rights, have endeared the \"amiable attack dog\" to some Democrats. He has joined union picket lines, taking the side of striking workers despite backlash from corporate interests.\n\nBut his record on abortion rights -- sure to be one of Harris' top issues -- is \"good but not great,\" according to some women's health advocates.\n\n\"Yes, he's doing better than a conservative would, and I'm thankful for that,\" Savannah Trebuna of the Kentucky Health Justice Network told NBC News last week. \"But I worry about how that record will look on a national stage.\"\n\nPritzker: Like Beshear, Pritzker's home state of Illinois is not considered in play for 2024 -- it is one of the most reliably Democratic states in the nation. And yet, he could bring considerable strength to the ticket due to his potential for becoming a powerful force in pushing back against attacks from Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nHis profile is higher than the other Midwestern Democratic governors under consideration, both because Illinois and Chicago occupy a loftier position in the nation's consciousness and because he is skilled at the art of launching attacks at political opponents -- as befits the state's tradition of bare-knuckle politics.\n\nPritzker, a scion of the billionaire Chicago family that made its fortune with the Hyatt hotel chain, is also well connected within the national Democratic Party. His sister, Penny Pritzker, was secretary of Commerce in the Obama administration. His bona fides as a political winner include emerging from a crowded primary field to defeat a Republican incumbent, Gov. Bruce Rauner, in 2018.\n\nSome analysts believe Pritzker could also be effective in attracting the votes of the \"never-Trumpers\" in the Republican Party.\n\nOn the downside, he may not be resonating with many Democratic voters. A poll of swing-state voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin conducted by Emerson College and The Hill last month showed Pritzker with the least support of any likely Harris VP pick in all the states but Wisconsin.\n\nShapiro: Hailing from perhaps the most important of all the swing states, Shapiro has a natural advantage in the Harris veepstakes -- it's a state she must win en route to the White House, making him one of the early front-runners for the job.\n\nHis defeat of controversial Republican opponent Doug Mastriano two years ago earned him a significant amount of positive name recognition among voters both in Pennsylvania and across the northeastern United States, which could prove helpful for Harris in attempting to lock down a crucial victory in the key state.\n\nIn fact, Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere around the country told NBC News shortly after his name emerged as a possible running mate he's the pick they fear most.\n\n\"I just think Shapiro is super strong,\" one former Trump ally told the broadcaster last week. \"And Republicans should be concerned about it. If I were her, that would be the pick.\" His main asset? \"He's pretty moderate,\" the source said, adding that as an observant Jew, Shapiro could appeal to faith-based voters on both the right and left of the political spectrum.\n\nShapiro has pulled in some Republican voters in all three of his previous statewide campaigns, but progressives have some serious issues with him, including his \"hardline\" stance backing Israel's campaign in Gaza, which could dampen young voters' newfound enthusiasm for Harris if selected.\n\nWalz: Perhaps the least-known of the six vice presidential finalists, Gov. Tim Walz has carved out a solid progressive record in a Midwestern state that is known as a longtime Democratic stronghold but in recent years has trended more purple.\n\nTwo other Minnesotans have been elected vice president on Democratic tickets -- Hubert Humphrey in 1964 and Walter Mondale in 1976. And despite his relative obscurity as a small-state governor, Walz could be a dark-horse pick to emerge with the prize after this weekend.\n\nHe's most in sync with Harris on what is possibly her signature issue: abortion and women's reproductive rights. As governor, Walz held Minnesota up as a stout supporter of pro-choice policies even as neighboring states such as Iowa were enacting some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the nation. In January 2023, he signed Minnesota's Protect Reproductive Options Act into law, affirming the \"fundamental right\" of women to obtain an abortion.\n\nWalz also has garnered significant attention with his ability to skewer opponents with humor, such as an appearance on MSNBC last month in which he said of Trump, Vance and their policies: \"These guys are weird.\"\n\nBut whether as an unknown he can be introduced and grow on voters nationwide in the short time allotted for the task is a pertinent question that could weigh against his chances.\n\nButtigieg: The 42-year-old Pete Buttigieg checks off a lot of boxes for the Democrats -- he's a Millennial, a Midwesterner, a former Indiana mayor, an Ivy Leaguer, a Naval officer who deployed to Afghanistan, and a gay man who lives in swing-state Michigan.\n\n\"Mayor Pete\" is already close with Harris and has established a strong pro-consumer record as Transportation secretary, regularly clashing with airlines over their treatment of the flying public on such topics as junk fees to compensating passengers for delays and cancellations.\n\nHe is also arguably the most well-known among the Democratic vice presidential candidates and has emerged as a top spokesman for the party, including holding his own during unfriendly interviews and showing a willingness to engage with conservative audiences in moments that frequently go viral online, Democratic strategists told The Hill last week.\n\nBut despite his steadily rising visibility, he is still considered a long shot for Harris' vice presidential nod, even by some of his own staffers. That could be because a Harris-Buttigieg ticket would consist only of Biden administration veterans, thus precluding an infusion of new blood.\n\nOr it could be that Buttigieg would, if chosen, become the first openly gay candidate on a national ticket that is already featuring the first woman of color vying for president. Would that be too much for swing voters?\n\nKelly: The Arizona senator, 60, was one of the early favorites in the Harris veepstakes and remains a likely choice for several reasons.\n\nSome of the more obvious ones include his all-American background as a former NASA astronaut and Navy captain. He is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, and is a well-liked Democrat from a crucial, increasingly purple state that helped decide the 2020 election. Kelly also boasts a track record of appealing to independents.\n\nThe fact that he's gained traction on Trump's signature issue of immigration while representing a border state could also be a big plus in his favor. During his short time in the Senate, he hasn't authored any major immigration legislation but gained points among Democrats for vocally backing Biden's bipartisan border deal, which failed in February after Trump urged Republican lawmakers to reject it.\n\nAmong Kelly's chief liabilities is his uneasy standing with the key Democratic constituency of organized labor. Union officials told ABC News last month they have doubts about Kelly due to his earlier unwillingness to co-sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would ease requirements to organize workers.\n\nKelly last week softened his stance, telling the Huffington Post he would now back the PRO Act.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "don_jacobson@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Don Jacobson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penny Pritzker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

She is scheduled to announce her pick at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Harris is expected to use these one-on-one meetings to test personal chemistry between her and her pick, who, if the ticket wins, will be her deputy for four years and another four years, if they are re-elected.\n\nThe other key qualification is governance - whether they will be ready to step in for her when needed. The finalists are the Governors of Minnesota and Pennsylvania, Tim Walz and Josh Shapiro, respectively, and Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nIt was not immediately apparent whether invitations had been extended to other contenders, such as Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Last month, Roy Cooper, the Governor of North Carolina, withdrew from the competition.\n\nTypically, presidential candidates spend months selecting a running mate. However, Harris was compelled to conclude her search within weeks following her ascent to the forefront of the Democratic ticket on July 21, after President Joe Biden ceased his re-election campaign amid internal party pressures and endorsed his vice president.\n\nEric Holder, the former Attorney General, along with a team of lawyers, has meticulously vetted the candidate, sifting through extensive documentation to compile a shortlist for Harris to consider. On Saturday, Holder presented his findings to the Vice-President at her Naval Observatory residence.\n\nHarris has cleared her weekend schedule of rallies to conclude the search and make her pivotal decision as the presumptive nominee. Minnesota Governor Walz has gained favor for his down-to-earth demeanor and strong union connections. As a past educator and multi-term House Representative, he has caught the attention of Democrats, notably for labeling the Republican nominee, ex-President Donald Trump, and his campaign as \"weird\" -- a term now adopted by Harris's campaign and Democrats throughout the party's ranks.\n\nShapiro, the Governor of Pennsylvania, is regarded as a leading contender due to his popularity in the state, which is pivotal for Harris's White House bid. The former two-term Attorney General secured the gubernatorial race in 2022 with a margin of nearly 15 percentage points. Currently, Harris lags behind Trump by 2.7 percentage points in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls.\n\nKelly hails from another crucial battleground state, Arizona, and his support could be instrumental in helping Harris achieve the 270 electoral college votes required to become the first female President of the United States. Harris is trailing Trump by 4 percentage points in Arizona. Kelly's background as a former fighter pilot and astronaut adds distinctive qualities to the ticket. He is also known for being the spouse of former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who left politics after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Holder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro, who has drawn opposition from progressives and even a senator in his home state.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nThe fissures among Democrats emerged as three leading contenders -- Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz -- met with Harris at her residence in Washington on Sunday, before a decision that her campaign said would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, declined to comment on the meetings.\n\nHarris is set to hit the campaign trail with her running mate this week, kicking off a five-day, seven-state tour with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia, where Shapiro is expected to be in attendance, whether he is her pick or not.\n\nProgressive groups have trained their criticisms on Shapiro and Kelly, whom they accuse of being too conservative on key issues. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said during a Sunday interview on CBS that Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged the union's concerns about his commitment to pro-labor legislation and that the organization had \"bigger issues\" with Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signaled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Harris' list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, has come out against Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on the Israel-Hamas war. The debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organizer called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Walz, who has become a favorite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed Friday.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about the war. \"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labor,\" he wrote in an email thread, which was shared with The New York Times. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who has long clashed with Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Shapiro, a development first reported by Politico.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesperson for Shapiro, declined to comment on the vice presidential selection process.\n\nThe growing attacks on Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the news media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" issued a forceful defense of the Pennsylvania governor on the social platform X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade.\"\n\nA group of progressive donors in recent days has been making a push for Walz. Over the past week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Wimsatt have circulated a memo called \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President,\" hoping to sway Harris.\n\nA similar document touting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who headlined a Harris fundraiser in New Hampshire on Saturday, was circulated last week to Democrats, including major donors.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nKelly's spokesperson, Jacob Peters, said the post was deleted because it was being misunderstood.\n\nShapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favorite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate such as Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who has fans among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee. Beshear has spent time over the past two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors who have been eager to kick the tires on him, including an invite-only session Friday evening, according to two people briefed on his activities.\n\nBeshear was not known to have participated in Harris' final interviews Sunday, but he was spotted with his labradoodle, Winnie, outside the governor's residency in Frankfort, Kentucky.\n\n\"Just walking the dog this morning,\" Beshear responded when asked about his plans for the day.\n\nWalz and Beshear are set to appear at dueling, simultaneous fundraisers to benefit Harris on Monday evening. Walz's event, in Minneapolis, was sold out as of Sunday evening; tickets remained available for Beshear's event, which will be in Chicago.\n\nBy that point, Harris' decision is likely to already have been made.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Harris spent time interviewing each of them over the weekend.\n\nBeing from the swing state with the most electoral votes up for grabs. Shapiro could provide a favorable boost for Harris.

Kelly has deep ties to the military, having served in the U.S. Navy as a combat pilot. He is married to former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords.\n\nAnother contender, Walz, is a man with deep Midwestern roots and a solid political resume. He became governor of Minnesota in 2019 and navigated the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the public outcry following the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer.\n\nHarris will kick-start her tour of battleground states in less than 24 hours, and her running mate is set to join her.\n\nBy Monday night, Harris will officially become the Democratic nominee for president.

Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota, as well as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona.\n\nHarris on Friday officially secured the nomination of Democratic Party by garnering a sufficient number of delegates during online voting that began Thursday, according to multiple reports citing comments made by Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison during a phone call with Harris supporters.\n\nThe vote cemented Harris' unprecedented rise from four up-and-down years as vice president to the near-unanimous pick to replace President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket -- all in less than two weeks.\n\n\"Today, my friends, is special, because we can proudly say we will have the first woman of color at the top of a major party ticket,\" Harrison said, while Harris herself joined the call and added, \"I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States.\n\n\"I would not be on this call right now and with you all were it not for your support and your trust, for which I am deeply grateful,\" she said.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her choice for vice president by Tuesday, when the candidate and her newly minted running mate are scheduled to hold their first rally together in Philadelphia, the largest city in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, according to campaign sources cited by Politico.\n\nThe team will then proceed to stops in western Wisconsin, Detroit, Raleigh, N.C., Savannah, S.C., Phoenix and Las Vegas.\n\nThe six likely finalists each brings possible strengths and weakness to the Democratic ticket. Here's a more detailed look at each.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear\n\nThe conventional wisdom that a vice presidential nominee could help a ticket win his or her home state would be out the window should Harris pick Beshear -- Donald Trump cruised to a 26-point victory in Kentucky four years ago and it remains highly unlikely the state will turn blue anytime soon. But the governor's status as a well-liked Democratic winner in an overwhelmingly Republican southern state could be a powerful incentive to add him to the ticket.\n\nHis proven ability to attract moderate or even conservative voters in rural and suburban areas who may not normally opt for Democrats, as well as his record of expanding health care services and fighting for voting rights, have endeared the \"amiable attack dog\" to some Democrats. He has joined union picket lines, taking the side of striking workers despite backlash from corporate interests.\n\nBut his record on abortion rights -- sure to be one of Harris' top issues -- is \"good but not great,\" according to some women's health advocates.\n\n\"Yes, he's doing better than a conservative would, and I'm thankful for that,\" Savannah Trebuna of the Kentucky Health Justice Network told NBC News last week. \"But I worry about how that record will look on a national stage.\"\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker\n\nLike Beshear, Pritzker's home state of Illinois is not considered in play for 2024 -- it is one of the most reliably Democratic states in the nation. And yet, he could bring considerable strength to the ticket due to his potential for becoming a powerful force in pushing back against attacks from Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio.\n\nHis profile is higher than the other Midwestern Democratic governors under consideration, both because Illinois and Chicago occupy a loftier position in the nation's consciousness and because he is skilled at the art of launching attacks at political opponents -- as befits the state's tradition of bare knuckle politics.\n\nPritzker, a scion of the billionaire Chicago family that made its fortune with the Hyatt hotel chain, is also well connected within the national Democratic Party. His sister, Penny Pritzker, was secretary of Commerce in the Obama administration. His bona fides as a political winner include emerging from a crowded primary field to defeat a Republican incumbent, Gov. Bruce Rauner, in 2018.\n\nSome analysts believe Pritzker could also be effective in attracting the votes of the \"never-Trumpers\" in the Republican Party.\n\nOn the downside, he may not be resonating with many Democratic voters. A poll of swing-state voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin conducted by Emerson College and The Hill last month showed Pritzker with the least support of any likely Harris VP pick in all the states but Wisconsin.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\n\nHailing from perhaps the most important of all the swing states, Shapiro has a natural advantage in the Harris veepstakes -- it's a state she must win en route to the White House, making him one of the early front-runners for the job.\n\nHis defeat of controversial Republican opponent Doug Mastriano two years ago earned him a significant amount positive name recognition among voters both in Pennsylvania and across the northeastern United States, which could prove helpful for Harris in attempting to lock down a crucial victory in the key state.\n\nIn fact, Republicans in Pennsylvania and elsewhere around the country told NBC News shortly after his name emerged as a possible running mate he's the pick they fear most.\n\n\"I just think Shapiro is super strong,\" one former Trump ally told the broadcaster last week. \"And Republicans should be concerned about it. If I were her, that would be the pick.\" His main asset? \"He's actually pretty moderate,\" the source said, adding that as an observant Jew, Shapiro could appeal to faith-based voters on both the right and left of the political spectrum.\n\nShapiro has pulled in some Republican voters in all three of his previous statewide campaigns, but progressives have some serious issues with him, including his \"hardline\" stance backing Israel's campaign in Gaza, which could dampen young voters' newfound enthusiasm for Harris if selected.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz\n\nPerhaps the least-known of the six vice presidential finalists, Gov. Tim Walz has carved out a solid progressive record in a Midwestern state that is known as a longtime Democratic stronghold but in recent years has trended more purple.\n\nTwo other Minnesotans have been elected vice president on Democratic tickets -- Hubert Humphrey in 1964 and Walter Mondale in 1976. And despite his relative obscurity as a small-state governor, Walz could be a dark-horse pick to emerge with the prize after this weekend.\n\nHe's most in sync with Harris on what is possibly her signature issue: abortion and women's reproductive rights. As governor, Walz held Minnesota up as a stout supporter of pro-choice policies even as neighboring states such as Iowa were enacting some of the strictest anti-abortion laws in the nation. In January 2023, he signed Minnesota's Protect Reproductive Options Act into law, affirming the \"fundamental right\" of women to obtain an abortion.\n\nWalz also has garnered significant attention with his ability to skewer opponents with humor, such as an appearance on MSNBC last month in which he said of Trump, Vance and their policies: \"These guys are weird.\"\n\nBut whether as an unknown he can be introduced and grow on voters nationwide in the short time allotted for the task is a pertinent question that could weigh against his chances.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nThe 42-year-old Pete Buttigieg checks off a lot of boxes for the Democrats -- he's a Millennial, a Midwesterner, a former Indiana mayor, an Ivy Leaguer, a Naval officer who deployed to Afghanistan, and a gay man who lives in swing-state Michigan.\n\n\"Mayor Pete\" is already close with Harris and has established a strong pro-consumer record as Transportation secretary, regularly clashing with airlines over their treatment of the flying public on such topics as junk fees to compensating passengers for delays and cancellations.\n\nHe is also arguably the most well-known among the Democratic vice presidential candidates and has emerged as a top spokesman for the party, including holding his own during unfriendly interviews and showing a willingness to engage with conservative audiences in moments that frequently go viral online, Democratic strategists told The Hill last week.\n\nBut despite his steadily rising visibility, he is still considered a long shot for Harris' vice presidential nod, even by some of his own staffers. That could be because a Harris-Buttigieg ticket would consist only of Biden administration veterans, thus precluding an infusion of new blood.\n\nOr it could be that Buttigieg would, if chosen, become the first openly gay candidate on a national ticket that is already featuring the first woman of color vying for president. Would that be too much for swing voters?\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona\n\nKelly, 60, was one of the early favorites in the Harris veepstakes and remains a likely choice for several reasons.\n\nSome of the more obvious ones include his all-American background as former NASA astronaut and Navy captain. He is married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, and is a well-liked Democrat from a crucial, increasingly purple state that helped decide the 2020 election. Kelly also boasts a track record of appealing to independents.\n\nThe fact that he's gained traction on Trump's signature issue of immigration while representing a border state could also be a big plus in his favor. During his short time in the Senate, he hasn't authored any major immigration legislation but gained points among Democrats for vocally backing Biden's bipartisan border deal, which failed in February after Trump urged Republican lawmakers to reject it.\n\nAmong Kelly's chief liabilities is his uneasy standing with the key Democratic constituency of organized labor. Union officials told ABC News last month they have doubts about Kelly due to his earlier unwillingness to co-sponsor the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would ease requirements to organize workers.\n\nKelly last week softened his stance, telling the Huffington Post he would now back the PRO Act.", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "don_jacobson@sanluisobispo.com", "name": "Don Jacobson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Penny Pritzker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Several team members of The Advocate make their predictions", "body": "Harris is expected to make the announcement soon. Here's what some of our team thinks.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's announcement on who will be her vice presidential pick is imminent. Members of The Advocate took some time to make their educated guesses on who it might be. Harris reportedly spent the weekend interviewing potential picks, and her campaign said that she and her pick will begin campaigning on Tuesday. So who do we think it could be? Keep reading to find out.\n\nKeep up with the latest in LGBTQ+ news and politics. Sign up for The Advocate's email newsletter.\n\nJohn Casey: I'm going to start by saying something publicly that we've been saying privately for the last few weeks, so I'm about to spill the tea to our readers...what a wild and crazy news cycle July proved to be. We could hardly keep up!\n\nWell, I'm sure that's not news to anyone, so perhaps we'll offer some surprises as we look into our crystal balls, tarot cards, and astrology signs to predict who now confirmed Democratic Presidential nominee Kamala Harris will choose as her running mate.\n\nHarris has been VP for the last four years, so she is intimately familiar with the job, and as such makes the perfect judge as to who should succeed her if she wins the presidency. The only thing I can predict with 100 percent certainty is that it will not be someone like JD Vance. My God, what a catastrophe! If you haven't read why he's the worst thing since Sarah Palin, I penned a few words about it in a recent column.\n\nThe Democrats are lucky to have such a deep bench of terrific talent, so the decision for Harris is a tough one - in a good way. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Witmer (she took herself out, but she's part of the bench as is North Carolina Gov Roy Cooper), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear, and Minnesota Gov Tim Walz are all accomplished and admirable.\n\nGiven all those talented politicians and leaders, it's impossible to really be able to predict who will be selected since they would all be great partners to Harris.\n\nThat said, I'm going with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro if for no other reason than the fact that I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, and so I know that picking a Pennsylvanian is always the right thing to do. Personal feelings aside, Shapiro is the smartest one in the bunch. He's closer to Harris than the others still in the running. He is wildly popular in Pennsylvania. He's done great things for the state, which will help Harris win the state, as well as give a boost to down-ballot candidates.\n\nAnd just as a aside, the last time Pennsylvania had a president or vice president on top of the ticket was James Buchanan who was our 15th president. It is about time Pennsylvania gets the recognition it deserves!\n\nShapiro is a former state attorney general like Harris, so he will be able to prosecute the case against Trump and Vance -- and as such should do well debating the incoherent Vance. And just as an aside, he's good-looking -- much better-looking than Vance which will drive Trump crazy.\n\nFinally, he married his high school sweetheart, and they have four children, so he's definitely not a childless cat lady.\n\nChristopher Wiggins: A friend on Facebook called me the group's \"political prophet\" earlier, so take that for whatever it's worth. While it would of course be an exceptional step forward for the country and for LGBTQ+ representation if Harris selected Buttigieg to be her running mate, I think it's unlikely that the dream ticket that much of the LGBTQ+ community is trying to manifest will come to fruition. There's an argument to be made for \"why not\" given that currently the choice is between Trumpism and autocracy and the opposite of that, regardless of who the Democratic ticket comprises. Maybe more people would vote to save the U.S. from dictatorship than those who wouldn't vote for a gay man on the ticket. I completely understand why people would say, \"then why not?\" Buttigieg is one of the best communicators in politics. He has what it takes to be at the highest levels of government in the U.S. I think that he would make an exceptional secretary of state if he's not the nominee; allowing him more time to win over America as a whole, so that one day he can be Mr. President.\n\nJust like Buttigieg would disarm Vance's military service, since he also served, I think that Kelly's long career as a Navy combat pilot and subsequent role as an astronaut earn him tons of respect as far as service to his country. His wife, former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot in the head during an assassination attempt, so he has credibility when it comes to the gun debate. He's clearly good under pressure, which is paramount as a vice president.\n\nBut, I too think it's going to be Shapiro. Mostly, I think that some of the clues around his schedule and Harris's campaign schedule hint in that direction. From what I understand, Shapiro has canceled a few fundraising events in the Hamptons that he had on the schedule for this weekend, according toThe New York Times. Also, Tuesday's big campaign rally to introduce Harris's running mate to a crowd is in Pennsylvania. He's an accomplished former attorney general; he has proven that he can win Pennsylvanians' votes, and he's a great communicator -- have you seen his social media game?\n\nJC: Well, my choice of Shapiro being validated by my esteemed colleague Christopher, gives me hope. Now let's see if anyone has a different opinion.\n\nRyan Adamczeski: Whoever Harris' VP pick is, it's going to be a white man. I'm not the first to say it -- and while I think it's ridiculous -- I don't believe voters would go for two women, or two people of color (Shapiro, who is Jewish like Harris' husband, is also out for this reason, as is Buttigieg for his sexuality). I think the Democratic Party will seek out a white man (maybe older and more moderate) to ease the minds of less progressive voters, as they did when Obama picked Biden as his VP. That leaves us with Cooper, who took himself out, and Beshear.\n\nNow think about it this way: if that prediction comes true, that person will actually be a \"DEI hire.\" Despite conservatives saying Harris was \"picked for her race and gender,\" a white male VP candidate would quite literally be picked for his race and gender.

It's Josh Shapiro, y'all.\n\n\"I'm hearing there's a 'firestorm' right now.

As it turns out, no.\"\n\nAccording to the Inquirer, a \"source close to Parker\" said: \"This is not an announcement of anything. This is just the mayor showing her support for a longtime friend who we know is one of the people being considered.\"\n\n\"It was merely the mayor supporting the governor's potential vice presidential candidacy, which she did earlier this week also in Philadelphia,\" the statement said.\n\nWho are the top contenders?\n\nMr Shapiro is among those heading Harris' short list.\n\nThe 51-year-old was elected as the Pennsylvanian Governor in 2022 and has continued to maintain high approval ratings.\n\nIf chosen, Mr Shapiro could help Ms Harris win the valuable battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Shapiro is toward the top,\" an inside source told the New York Post.\n\n\"Locking down Pennsylvania would change the entire trajectory of the race.\"\n\nMr Shapiro is up against Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut and navy pilot, who is considered a \" dangerous choice for Republicans\".\n\n\"He and his wife Gabby are very well liked and respected in Arizona,\" Meghan McCain, the daughter of late Republican Arizona senator John McCain, said.\n\n\"His military and NASA background is obviously very compelling and inspirational\"\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, is also among those vying for the Vice Presidential slot.\n\nThe 60-year-old has helped shape campaign messaging after labelling Donald Trump and J.D. Vance \"weird\" - a key phrase now being rolled out by the Democrats.\n\n\"I see Donald Trump talking about the wonderful Hannibal Lecter or whatever weird thing he is on tonight ...

At least three of the finalists -- Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona -- are scheduled to meet with Vice President Harris in what is being described as a \"chemistry test,\" per the New York Times.\n\nThe in-person chats are the apparent last step in the weeks-long search to choose who will join Harris on her historic 2024 ticket. The campaign has said they will announce the pick ahead of Harris's scheduled rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The event will mark the duo's first combined stop before touring seven swing states in just four days, according to Politico reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if others in the veepstakes mix -- like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky -- had already met with Harris or were also on the docket.\n\nThis final test is \"one that Ms. Harris is expected to put considerable stock in,\" the Times writes. \"Aides and associates have said that she often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\"\n\nThese more intimate meetings come after an accelerated vetting process by the Harris campaign, and information found in that process, according to one of the finalists, has been shared with the potential VPs. A kind of public vetting process has played out in media interviews, on social media, and in the halls of Congress, too.\n\nOn Friday, Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker's team published a tweet and video that appeared to show that Pennsylvania's governor, Shapiro, was the VP pick. At first, the video seemed like an accidental leak of insider information before Harris's choice was made public. A source close to Parker quickly told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the mayor was showing her support for Shapiro, but wasn't announcing anything conclusive.\n\nWhile the campaign's choice to hold its first full-ticket event in Philadelphia could be seen as an Easter egg, a Harris aide \"cautioned against reading too much into the first city chosen for the tour,\" Politico reported.\n\nShapiro's position at the helm of a key 2024 battleground state has put him on top of the veepstakes race. The governor, 51, drew national attention in 2020 when, as attorney general, he handled then-President Donald Trump's slew of election fraud lawsuits against the state. Plus, he's got lots of experience winning tough elections -- when he took the governor's office, Shapiro made history by winning more votes than any Pennsylvania governor ever had.\n\nHis road to the ticket has also been filled with controversy.\n\nThe director of the National Women's Defense League critiqued Shapiro's handling of a sexual harassment complaint against his aide and said he \"should have done a better job\" in that situation. (A spokesperson told the Pennsylvania Capital-Star that the governor and his administration \"take every allegation of discrimination and harassment extremely seriously and have robust procedures in place to thoroughly investigate all reports.\")\n\nShapiro's past views and current positions on the war in Palestine have come under intense pressure from progressives. In a 1993 article he wrote while in college, Shapiro claimed that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.\" This week, he told reporters that his views have changed.\n\nWhile he's called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"one of the worst leaders of all time,\" his handling of campus anti-war protests has led some progressives to worry about how he would handle the issue as the president's close ally.\n\nBefore Walz joined public office in 2007, he was a member of the Army National Guard and a longtime school teacher and football coach. Walz's recent uptick in national name recognition has come from conversational and blunt interviews in which the Minnesotan talks openly about his family and community. He's spoken about his family's use of IVF and critiqued the GOP's attacks on reproductive care.\n\nThe Minnesota governor has been a leading advocate of calling Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, simply \"weird.\"\n\n\"We do not like what has happened, when you can't even go to Thanksgiving dinner with your uncle because you end up in some weird fight that is unnecessary,\" Walz said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. \"Well, it's true. These guys are just weird.\"\n\nWalz is also known for his state's universal free school meals, which he signed into law last year. In one year, from September 2023 to September 2023, 1.1 million more breakfasts and 1.1 million more lunches were served to students -- a 30 percent increase.\n\nBernie Sanders recently put his support behind Walz. In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio on Saturday, the senator said he \"had the opportunity to talk to your governor a few days ago\" and was \"very impressed by him.\"\n\n\"So, I hope very much that the vice president elects a running mate who will speak up and take on powerful corporate interests,\" Sanders continued. \"And I think Tim Walz is somebody who could do that.\"\n\nWhen asked about Harris's VP pick, a source close to former Speaker of the House and top move maker Nancy Pelosi told The Hill that she \"is always especially fond of former House colleagues\" -- seemingly a hint at Walz.\n\nWhile Walz's positions on key issues have shifted over the years, he has shown an openness to rethinking his views. At one point, he had an A rating from the National Rifle Association and received their endorsement before later denouncing the gun rights organization and proposing a ban on assault weapons.\n\nKelly was elected in 2020 and is best known as a Navy pilot, a NASA astronaut, and the husband of former Representative Gabby Giffords -- who survived an assassination attempt in 2011 that left six dead and several injured. For years before running for office himself, Kelly was used to standing alongside his wife in her governmental duties. This experience could benefit him as a running mate for Harris, who has already faced deeply misogynistic and racist attacks from the right.\n\nWhile in office, Kelly has been a firm supporter of policies that would strengthen firearm safety and security measures.\n\n\"We have some of the most permissive gun laws in the world, and we have some of the highest levels of gun violence,\" Kelly told Face the Nation's Margaret Brennan in 2023. \"We passed this bipartisan Safer Communities Act. It is a step in the right direction, but it's only one step and there is more we can do.\"\n\nIf Harris were to choose Kelly, it would mean a West Coast heavy ticket -- though the senator is known, in part, for his firsthand experience working on immigration policy from a border state. And he has a history of support with Latino voters, a key bloc for Democrats this year.\n\nWhen Arizona's Supreme Court upheld an 1864 abortion ban, which made nearly all abortions in the state illegal and opened the door to criminalizing healthcare providers with up to five years in prison, Kelly was staunchly opposed, saying he was, \"going to fight as hard as ever to restore reproductive rights.\"\n\nSome Democrats worry about what could happen should Kelly be pegged for the presidential race. A Republican could potentially win a special election in Arizona to finish Kelly's current term, jeopardizing control in the battleground state.\n\nThe Harris campaign has said they will announce the news via a text to supporters early this week.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz",

As Pennsylvania's top law enforcement official, he oversaw the investigation of widespread sexual abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests and a decades-long cover-up by the Catholic church.\n\nWalz, a former congressman, is serving his second term as governor and also has high approval ratings. With Democrats controlling both chambers of the state legislature during his second term, Walz has enacted a number of progressive priorities, including the protection of abortion access and gender-affirming health care, legalizing recreational marijuana, restricting gun access, providing free school meals to all kids and expanding paid family leave.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Harris is also interviewing Govs. Andy Beshear of Kentucky and J.B.

Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. All three met with Harris on Sunday.\n\nThree others under consideration are Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.\n\nThe decision is being closely watched and kicks off a five-day campaign tour of seven states this week, in the crucial states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nTop senator outlines what Trump must do to beat Kamala Harris -- while giving Donald a stern warning amid brutal polls\n\nLindsey Graham has told Donald Trump what he needs to do to beat Kamala Harris, after polls showed the vice president quickly overtaking him.\n\nOverall, the race is neck and neck, according to a new CBS News/YouGov poll. Nationally, Harris leads Trump 50 percent to 49 percent among likely voters. In the swing states, the race is now tied at 50 percent.\n\nGraham, the South Carolina senator, said Trump should focus on the issues where Harris is weak, rather than stirring up controversy over her identity as a mixed-race woman.\n\n\"The problem I have with Kamala Harris is not her race, it's her judgment,\" Graham told Fox News on Sunday.\n\n\"She's been wrong about everything. When she tried to explain what she was going to do about inflation and an impending recession, it didn't make sense. It's nonsense.\"\n\nFears that the US is heading for a recession are causing a global stock market slump, with Japan's Nikkei seeing its biggest sell-off since 'Black Monday'\n\nGlobal stock markets continued to fall on Monday on fears that the US economy is heading for a recession, while Japan suffered its worst sell-off since 'Black Monday' in 1987.\n\nAccording to experts at investment bank Goldman Sachs, the chance of a recession in the US is now as high as 25 percent. That is ten percent more than their previous estimate of 15 percent. JP Morgan, however, estimates the chance of a recession at 50 percent.\n\nU.S. stock index futures fell sharply on Monday, with futures tied to the Nasdaq down nearly 4 percent. However, traders are now increasingly betting that the Federal Reserve will announce an emergency interest rate cut in response to the global stock market crash and to prevent a massive recession.\n\nEmployers added just 114,000 jobs last month, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department, well short of the Dow Jones estimate of 185,000.\n\nNancy Pelosi grins as she reveals her role in Biden's dramatic exit from the 2024 race - before making the bizarre suggestion that Joe's face belongs on Mount Rushmore\n\nSpeaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi revealed her exact role in Democrats' efforts to drop President Joe Biden from the 2024 presidential race, leading to his dramatic departure and Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee.\n\nPelosi shared her thoughts on the president, his fitness for office and his decision to step aside in an interview with veteran journalist Lesley Stahl for CBS Sunday Morning ahead of the release of her new book, \"The Art of Power.\"\n\nPelosi was asked what she said to Biden to convince him to step aside, ahead of his dramatic exit from the 2024 presidential race on July 21.\n\n\"Well, I have never had any public conversations with the president of the United States, no,\" Pelosi said with a smile. Pelosi said Biden knows she loves him \"very much.\"\n\nStahl pressured Pelosi after she reported that she was leading a pressure campaign to get Biden to withdraw.\n\n\"No, I was not the leader of the pressure...\" Pelosi said, shaking her head.\n\nSenator Mark Kelly sparks speculation he may withdraw from vice presidential race\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly caused a stir when he suggested he was no longer considered for Kamala Harris' running mate.\n\nIn a now-deleted social media post, Kelly wrote Sunday night:\n\nI spent my life in the Navy and NASA where the mission always comes first. Now my mission is to serve Arizonans.\n\nBy writing \"in service of the people of Arizona,\" many speculated that the former astronaut meant he had blown his chance to become the next Democratic vice president.\n\nJust 30 minutes after the original X-post, Kelly deleted it and replaced it with:\n\nWhether it's through my time in the Navy and NASA, my time in the U.S. Senate, or visiting our troops overseas, I've learned that when your country calls you to serve, you always answer the call.\n\nKelly is considered one of the top three men Harris is considering for the role, along with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nBiden Heads to Situation Room as Iran Threatens to Attack Israel\n\nPresident Joe Biden will meet with his national security team in the Situation Room later Monday as tensions between Iran and Israel rise.\n\nThe Islamic Republic could attack Israel within 24 to 48 hours after a major attack by Hezbollah that wounded two IDF soldiers, top Western diplomats have warned.\n\nSecretary of State Anthony Blinken told the G7 yesterday that an attack was imminent in response to Israel's killings of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Fuad Shukr in Beirut, Axios reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III reportedly spoke with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant on Sunday to assure the Jewish state of US support.\n\nIt would be the second time Iran has directly attacked Israel during the growing Middle East crisis.

Check out the full list", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris is set to interview potential vice-presidential picks, including Senators Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Each candidate offers unique strengths and challenges. The decision is critical as Harris prepares for the 2024 election against Donald Trump. Other potential candidates include Pete Buttigieg and Andy Beshear. Harris's choice will impact her campaign strategy and the Democratic ticket.Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with top candidates for her vice-presidential pick this Sunday, a critical step as she prepares for the 2024 presidential election. This round of interviews, held at her official residence, aims to identify a running mate who aligns with her values and can effectively support her campaign.\n\nFinal Round of Interviews\n\nThe final interviews will include discussions with Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Harris is expected to assess each candidate's compatibility, political strength, and readiness to assume the presidency if needed.\n\nMark Kelly\n\nMark Kelly, the former astronaut and current Arizona Senator, has gained attention for his strong performance in a pivotal swing state. His military background and focus on gun control are notable, although his views on immigration and labor issues have drawn some criticism from within the Democratic Party.\n\nTim Walz\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz brings a blend of executive and legislative experience. Known for his straightforward approach and military service, Walz has been praised for his leadership during national protests. However, his home state's lack of battleground status might limit his strategic value for the general election.\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro could be a strategic asset due to his strong connections to a key swing state. Shapiro's achievements, such as the rapid repair of a collapsed bridge, highlight his effectiveness. Yet, his support for school vouchers and previous controversies may pose challenges.\n\nOther Potential Candidates\n\nIn addition to these front-runners, other names under consideration include Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Buttigieg's communication skills and experience with public crises make him a strong contender, while Beshear's success in a Republican-dominated state and personal connection with Harris are notable.\n\nThe Decision Ahead\n\nAs the deadline approaches for selecting a vice-presidential candidate, Harris must carefully evaluate these options.

Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly emerged among the potential finalists, both faced criticism from some organizations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes.\n\nThe Harris campaign team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected on Monday.\n\nThe following day, she and her running mate will appear together at a rally in Philadelphia, then visit six more swing states.\n\nIn addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov.

She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as the vice presidential candidate -- appearing to suggest the mayor had inside knowledge about Harris' decision.\n\nBut a person with knowledge of the mayor's thinking said the video was simply a case of Parker showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker's friend, would be the vice presidential pick. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nKelly and Shapiro also have seen their detractors become more vocal.\n\nIt's an indication that the honeymoon period for the vice president, where the distinct wings of the Democratic Party coalesced behind her, may end in the less than two weeks since President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her.\n\nSome labor groups criticized Kelly for opposing legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union would not support Kelly as a potential running mate.\n\nFain also said the union does not favor Shapiro, who previously proved willing to join with Republicans in calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain praised Beshear, Walz and Pritzker.\n\n\"She's probably got a thousand people telling her the same thing, you know, of what they think,\" Fain said in an interview. \"And so she's got to make the decision based off of what she feels is, you know, is best for her.\"\n\nThe nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding said Shapiro \"is not the right candidate for the job, and selecting him would be a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nShapiro, who says he plans to be at Harris' rally Tuesday in Philadelphia, aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza.\n\nShapiro called out universities for not acting quickly to tackle antisemitism and became a prominent critic of the University of Pennsylvania's president, Liz Magill.\n\nShe resigned after testifying at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school's conduct policy.\n\nShapiro also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while suggesting an end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the governor for not condemning Israel for the killing of civilians in Gaza or for not calling for Israel to stop the fighting in the territory. Shapiro countered that he met with Muslim Americans and understands their pain.\n\nThe progressive activist organization RootsAction.org opposes Shapiro's views on Israel, school vouchers and the environment, among other issues. It says in considering Shapiro, Harris \"set off alarm bells among young people, racial justice organizers, Arab Americans, Muslims and others whose votes and campaign activism were crucial to defeating Trump four years ago.\"\n\nMeanwhile, The Philadelphia Inquirer resurfaced an opinion article Shapiro wrote in 1993 as a 20-year-old college student at the University of Rochester, in which he said peace \"will never come\" to the Middle East and Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to coexist with Israel.\n\nAsked about it, Shapiro responded, \"I was 20\" adding that he's long supported a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\n\"It is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nAlso opposing Shapiro are some environmental leaders and residents of the rural town of Dimock, Pennsylvania. They have drafted a letter to Harris urging her not to choose Shapiro and charging that the governor failed to keep his promises to clean up area groundwater contaminated by natural gas production via hydraulic fracturing.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Deere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherelle_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cherelle Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Asked what qualities she should look for in a vice-presidential candidate, he said: \"I'll let her work that out.\"\n\nPotential partners to join Ms. Harris on the Democratic ticket for November's election face an exhaustive vetting process, having to answer up to 200 questions before being seriously considered.\n\nDelegates do not vote on the vice-presidential pick.\n\nThe United Automobile Workers, a major US union representing more than 400,000 people, said its preferred vice-presidential pick was Mr. Beshear, who \"stood with us on the picket line and has been there for workers\".\n\nSpeaking to CBS' Face the Nation, UAW President Shawn Fain added that Mr. Walz was also \"100% behind labour\", but he criticised Mr Shapiro's support of private school vouchers in Pennsylvania, a Republican-backed proposal to send $100m to families for private school tuition and school supplies.\n\nWhile she holds those meetings, CBS News, BBC's US partner, suggests Ms. Harris holds a slight edge over her Republican rival Donald Trump, leading by one point nationally.\n\nAcross battleground states, the poll indicates that the pair are neck-and-neck. Trump still enjoys a small lead in a few states - Wisconsin, Georgia and North Carolina - but the race has tightened significantly since Mr. Biden bowed out and Ms. Harris became the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe poll suggests that the vice-president has energised the Democratic base, with young, black and female voters noting their renewed enthusiasm for the presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's campaign is still beset by comments he made at a convention for US-based black journalists in which he questioned Ms. Harris' racial identity.\n\nTrump said of Ms. Harris: \"I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. So, I don't know. Is she Indian? Or is she black?\"\n\nMs. Harris' mother was born in India and her father is from Jamaica. She has always identified as both Indian American and black.\n\nMultiple Trump allies appeared on US politics shows on Sunday in an attempt to shift attention from what he said.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime Trump backer, said he would advise the former president to focus on the Biden-Harris administration's policy decision, and not the vice-president's heritage.\n\n\"Every day we're talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life; it's a good day for her and a bad day for us,\" Mr. Graham told Fox News Sunday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Senator Laphonza Butler, a Democrat who represents Ms. Harris' home state of California, called the comments about the vice-president's race \"despicable\" and \"an insult\" during an appearance on CNN.\n\n\"This is a woman who was born in Oakland, California, who has declared and lived proudly all of her identities her entire life, embracing the totality of who she is,\" she said.\n\n\"This is the only card he (Trump)'s got to play, and so he's playing it. He's desperate.\" (BBC)", "source": {"uri": "guyanachronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guyana Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz",

This campaign is about people coming together, fueled by love of country, to fight for the best of who we are,\" she posted on X.\n\nFresh from winning enough delegate votes to secure the Democratic nomination, the country's first female, Black and South Asian vice president heads into the national convention in Chicago in two weeks in total control of her party.\n\nIn a campaign that is barely two weeks old, the 59-year-old former prosecutor has obliterated fundraising records, attracted huge crowds and dominated social media on her way to erasing the polling leads Trump had built before President Joe Biden quit the race.\n\nNext on the agenda is a vice presidential pick, with an announcement expected any time before her rally Tuesday evening alongside the mystery nominee in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's largest city.\n\nThe Keystone State is the most prized real estate among the closely fought battlegrounds that decide the Electoral College system.\n\nIt is part of the \"blue wall\" that carried Biden to the White House in 2020, alongside Michigan and Wisconsin -- two states where Harris is due to woo crowds on Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania is governed by 51-year-old Democrat Josh Shapiro, a frontrunner in the so-called \"veepstakes\" shortlist that also includes fellow state governors Tim Walz and Andy Beshear, as well as Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\n- 'Freedom' -\n\nHarris (top left) will choose between (L-R, top to bottom): Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, US Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, and US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg\n\nLater in the week, Harris will tour the more racially diverse Sun Belt and southern states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina, as she seeks to shore up the Black and Hispanic vote that had been peeling away from the Democrats.\n\nJust a month ago, Trump was in cruise control, having opened a significant lead in swing state polling after a dismal debate performance by Biden, with the Republican tycoon keeping the country in suspense over his own vice-presidential pick.\n\nTrump's White House bid was upended on July 21 when 81-year-old Biden, facing growing concerns about his age and lagging polling numbers, exited the race and backed Harris.\n\nEnergetic and two decades younger than 78-year-old Trump, the vice president has made a fast start, raising $310 million in July, according to her campaign -- more than double Trump's haul.\n\nWhile Biden made high-minded appeals for a return to civility and the preservation of democracy, Harris has focused on the future, making voters' hard-fought \"freedom\" the touchstone of her campaign.\n\nShe and her allies have also been more aggressive than the Biden camp -- mocking Trump for reneging on his commitment to a September 10 debate and characterizing the convicted felon as an elderly crook and \"weird.\"\n\nWhile she has disavowed some of the leftist positions she took during her ill-fated 2020 primary campaign, Harris hasn't given a wide-ranging interview since jumping into the race, and rally-goers will look for more detail on her plans for the country.\n\nMeanwhile Trump and his Republicans have struggled to adapt to their new adversary or hone their attacks against Harris -- at first messaging that she was dangerously liberal on immigration and crime, before suggesting she was lying about being Black.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

This is what we're watching.\n\nKamala Harris met with V.P. finalists\n\nKamala Harris, the U.S. vice president, met yesterday with the top candidates to be her running mate at her Naval Observatory residence in Washington, as she moved to close out her search for a vice president with a test of chemistry. Here's the latest.\n\nThree leading contenders -- Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania -- spoke with Harris in private meetings, according to several people briefed on the plans.\n\nHarris often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers, her aides and associates have said, and she is expected to place considerable stock in the in-person meetings. Her campaign has said it would announce her choice of a vice-presidential candidate before Harris and her running mate begin a tour of battleground states tomorrow.\n\nIn other news from the race:\n\nHarris and Donald Trump are essentially tied in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Trump has a slight lead in Georgia and Wisconsin.\n\nRobert F.

She will start in Philadelphia, which has done nothing to quell the rumors that Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has been tapped.\n\nHe was one of six who were interviewed over the weekend, according to \"two people with knowledge of Harris' selection process\" who spoke to the Associated Press. The others were reportedly Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nShapiro suddenly changed his weekend travel plans last Thursday, when he called off a fundraising trip to the wealthy Long Island, New York, community of the Hamptons.\n\nHis press secretary, Manuel Bonder, previously told Newsweek: \"The governor's trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee. His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Philadelphia Magazine political writer Ernest Owens claimed that Philadelphia Democrats have already come to the conclusion that Shapiro has been selected for the role.\n\nIn a post to X, formerly Twitter, he said: \"I'm hearing from Philly Democratic Party members at their weekly luncheon today that Josh Shapiro is going to be Kamala Harris's VP pick and that local unions pulled for him. Apparently, her campaign is trying to get Wall Street to pour more money before announcing him.\"\n\nShapiro would bring obvious benefits to Harris' ticket as the governor of a major swing state and he may appeal to some more conservative voters for things like his recent push to lower corporate taxes in his state.\n\nShapiro also has progressive support as he is seen as a voice for the \"common man.\" For example, when he was attorney general of Pennsylvania, he took on lenders at the private equity company Warburg Pincus. He led the lawsuit, which includes multiple states, against the firm, which was accused of leading consumers into a cycle of debt by charging them for hidden add-on products.\n\nBut some Democrats may have a problem with Shapiro's stance on Israel, as he has been vocal about his support of Israel's right to defend itself after Hamas launched its deadly attack on October 7, which saw around 1,200 people killed and about 251 taken hostage, many of whom are still in Gaza.\n\nSome on the left are concerned about Israel's response, which has laid waste to much of the enclaved Strip and killed about 39,000, many of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\n\nBut the state he brings with him, Minnesota, is only considered a \"second tier\" battleground state. While the margins of Democratic victory have often been narrow, the state has consistently voted Democrat, last voting Republican during former President Richard Nixon's landslide victory in 1972.\n\nOnline sportsbook BetOnline.agshows Walz has recently enjoyed a surge in his previous 16/1 odds, jumping to +190.\n\nOther notable contenders include Kelly, whose odds have improved to +900, and Beshear at +1400. Both have been touted for their ability to win in traditionally Republican-leaning states, a quality that could prove valuable in a national campaign.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_king@newsweek.com", "name": "Jordan King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Others in contention include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. The vice president is expected to decide who will be her running mate in the coming days.\n\nIn a Sunday appearance on CNN's State of the Union, when asked by host Dana Bash \"who are Republicans most worried about\" regarding Harris' running mate shortlist, Duncan, a Republican, pointed out that Shapiro would make the GOP \"scared\" citing that Shapiro would help Democrats win Pennsylvania again.\n\nBiden won the state in 2020, flipping it when Trump won in 2016.\n\n\"I think Kamala Harris has de-risked her finalists list. There really is no mistake in that list, there is no chance of her doing a JD Vance selection and doing harm to the ticket. So I do think the blocking and tackling of simple math is Pennsylvania. I think Republicans would be scared to see a governor of Pennsylvania almost instantly flip that state to be a loss for Democrats to being a win for Democrats,\" Duncan said.\n\nHe added: \"I think that creates regional creep and you can probably get Michigan to come along and other states, so I think it creates momentum. At the end of the day she doesn't have a liability on her hands with whoever she picks.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Harris' campaign and Trump's campaign via email for comment.\n\nDuncan, a lifelong Republican who had previously said he would be voting for Biden over Trump in November, confirmed his support for Harris on social media and in an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Politically Georgia podcast late last month.\n\n\"I'm committed to beating Donald Trump. The only vehicle left for me to do that with is the Democratic Party. If that requires me to vote for, speak for, or endorse Kamala Harris then count me in,\" Duncan posted on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\nThis comes as Vance has been in the spotlight for past remarks he made. Vance has recently faced criticism for saying the United States is run by \"childless cat ladies\" during an interview with Fox News in 2021 while running for U.S. Senate, pointing to Harris as an example.\n\nVance and Trump have continued to defend the remarks amid the backlash.\n\nTaylor Van Kirk, a spokesperson for Vance, said in a previous statement to Newsweek, \"Once again, the leftwing media have twisted Senator Vance's words and spun up a false narrative about his position on the issues. The Democrats are in complete disarray with the most unpopular Vice President in history as their party's nominee. The only childlessness we should be talking about are the childless parents who lost their kids to the murderous thugs and deadly fentanyl coming across Kamala's southern border.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Shapiro, who is viewed as the front-runner, recently renewed vice president speculation after he canceled three fundraisers that were due to take place on New York's Long Island this weekend.\n\n\"The Governor's trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,\" Manuel Bonder, Shapiro's press secretary, said in a statement previously emailed to Newsweek. \"His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.\"\n\nDespite speculation, Shapiro declined to answer last week whether he was interested in being on the ticket with Harris.\n\n\"I've said this before; I'll say it again: The vice president has a very deeply personal decision to make right now -- who she wants to run with, who she wants to govern with, and who can be by her side when she has to make the toughest decisions for the American people,\" he said, according to CBS News. \"I trust that she will make that decision on her own terms when she is ready.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_venegas@newsweek.com", "name": "Natalie Venegas", "type": "author",

Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly emerged among the potential finalists, both faced criticism from some organizations and activists who might otherwise be supportive of Democratic causes.\n\nThe Harris campaign team says she is interviewing six possible choices over the weekend before an announcement expected on Monday.\n\nThe following day, she and her running mate will appear together at a rally in Philadelphia, then visit six more swing states.\n\nIn addition to Shapiro and Kelly, Harris is said to be considering Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Now these Greensboro families want answers.\n\nSome congressional Democrats promoted Kelly, a former Navy pilot and astronaut whose state has more than 370 miles of border with Mexico.\n\nThey say his selection could help defuse attacks by the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, who argues the Biden administration's immigration policies are too relaxed.\n\nShapiro has high-profile supporters, too, including Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. She caused a stir by posting a video Friday depicting several Philadelphia-area officials and Democrats promoting Harris, but also playing up Shapiro as the vice presidential candidate -- appearing to suggest the mayor had inside knowledge about Harris' decision.\n\nBut a person with knowledge of the mayor's thinking said the video was simply a case of Parker showing support for both Harris and the potential that Shapiro, Parker's friend, would be the vice presidential pick. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nKelly and Shapiro also have seen their detractors become more vocal.\n\nIt's an indication that the honeymoon period for the vice president, where the distinct wings of the Democratic Party coalesced behind her, may end in the less than two weeks since President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her.\n\nSome labor groups criticized Kelly for opposing legislation they argue would boost union organizing. Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said that despite backing Harris for president, his 370,000-member union would not support Kelly as a potential running mate.\n\nFain also said the union does not favor Shapiro, who previously proved willing to join with Republicans in calls to expand voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain praised Beshear, Walz and Pritzker.\n\n\"She's probably got a thousand people telling her the same thing, you know, of what they think,\" Fain said in an interview. \"And so she's got to make the decision based off of what she feels is, you know, is best for her.\"\n\nThe nonprofit Institute for Middle East Understanding said Shapiro \"is not the right candidate for the job, and selecting him would be a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nShapiro, who says he plans to be at Harris' rally Tuesday in Philadelphia, aggressively confronted what he views as antisemitism cropping up from pro-Palestinian demonstrations and has professed solidarity with Israel in its drive to eliminate Hamas as it Israel battles the militants in Gaza.\n\nShapiro called out universities for not acting quickly to tackle antisemitism and became a prominent critic of the University of Pennsylvania's president, Liz Magill.\n\nShe resigned after testifying at a congressional hearing where she was unable to say under questioning that calls on campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school's conduct policy.\n\nShapiro also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while suggesting an end to the Israel-Hamas war requires the removal of Hamas from power.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations criticized the governor for not condemning Israel for the killing of civilians in Gaza or for not calling for Israel to stop the fighting in the territory. Shapiro countered that he met with Muslim Americans and understands their pain.\n\nThe progressive activist organization RootsAction.org opposes Shapiro's views on Israel, school vouchers and the environment, among other issues. It says in considering Shapiro, Harris \"set off alarm bells among young people, racial justice organizers, Arab Americans, Muslims and others whose votes and campaign activism were crucial to defeating Trump four years ago.\"\n\nMeanwhile, The Philadelphia Inquirer resurfaced an opinion article Shapiro wrote in 1993 as a 20-year-old college student at the University of Rochester, in which he said peace \"will never come\" to the Middle East and Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to coexist with Israel.\n\nAsked about it, Shapiro responded, \"I was 20\" adding that he's long supported a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\n\"It is my hope that we can see a day where peace will reign in the Middle East,\" he said.\n\nAlso opposing Shapiro are some environmental leaders and residents of the rural town of Dimock, Pennsylvania. They have drafted a letter to Harris urging her not to choose Shapiro and charging that the governor failed to keep his promises to clean up area groundwater contaminated by natural gas production via hydraulic fracturing.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "mcdowellnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "McDowellNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDowell_County,_West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McDowell County, West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McDowell County, West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherelle_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cherelle Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

At least three of the finalists -- Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota, and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona -- are scheduled to meet with Vice President Harris in what is being described as a \"chemistry test,\" per the New York Times.\n\nThe in-person chats are the apparent last step in the weeks-long search to choose who will join Harris on her historic 2024 ticket. The campaign has said they will announce the pick ahead of Harris's scheduled rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The event will mark the duo's first combined stop before touring seven swing states in just four days, according to Politico reporting.\n\nIt's unclear if others in the veepstakes mix -- like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky -- had already met with Harris or were also on the docket.\n\nThis final test is \"one that Ms. Harris is expected to put considerable stock in,\" the Times writes. \"Aides and associates have said that she often prioritizes personal rapport with her staff and advisers.\"\n\nThese more intimate meetings come after an accelerated vetting process by the Harris campaign, and information found in that process, according to one of the finalists, has been shared with the potential VPs. A kind of public vetting process has played out in media interviews, on social media, and in the halls of Congress, too.\n\nOn Friday, Philadelphia mayor Cherelle Parker's team published a tweet and video that appeared to show that Pennsylvania's governor, Shapiro, was the VP pick. At first, the video seemed like an accidental leak of insider information before Harris's choice was made public. A source close to Parker quickly told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the mayor was showing her support for Shapiro, but wasn't announcing anything conclusive.\n\nWhile the campaign's choice to hold its first full-ticket event in Philadelphia could be seen as an Easter egg, a Harris aide \"cautioned against reading too much into the first city chosen for the tour,\" Politico reported.\n\nShapiro's position at the helm of a key 2024 battleground state has put him on top of the veepstakes race. The governor, 51, drew national attention in 2020 when, as attorney general, he handled then-President Donald Trump's slew of election fraud lawsuits against the state. Plus, he's got lots of experience winning tough elections -- when he took the governor's office, Shapiro made history by winning more votes than any Pennsylvania governor ever had.\n\nHis road to the ticket has also been filled with controversy.\n\nThe director of the National Women's Defense League critiqued Shapiro's handling of a sexual harassment complaint against his aide and said he \"should have done a better job\" in that situation. (A spokesperson told the Pennsylvania Capital-Star that the governor and his administration \"take every allegation of discrimination and harassment extremely seriously and have robust procedures in place to thoroughly investigate all reports.\")\n\nShapiro's past views and current positions on the war in Palestine have come under intense pressure from progressives. In a 1993 article he wrote while in college, Shapiro claimed that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded to be able to establish a peaceful homeland of their own.\" This week, he told reporters that his views have changed.\n\nWhile he's called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"one of the worst leaders of all time,\" his handling of campus anti-war protests has led some progressives to worry about how he would handle the issue as the president's close ally.\n\nBefore Walz joined public office in 2007, he was a member of the Army National Guard and a longtime school teacher and football coach. Walz's recent uptick in national name recognition has come from conversational and blunt interviews in which the Minnesotan talks openly about his family and community. He's spoken about his family's use of IVF and critiqued the GOP's attacks on reproductive care.", "source": {"uri": "vanityfair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanity Fair"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Epstein reported from Washington, Theodore Schleifer reported from New York and Nick Corasaniti reported from Asbury Park, N.J.\n\nThe competitive, divisive primary that many Democrats long wanted to avoid has arrived anyway -- playing out largely behind closed doors in a fight over the bottom of the ticket.\n\nThe final stage of the campaign to be Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate reached something of an ugly phase in recent days as donors, interest groups and political rivals from the party's moderate and progressive wings lobbied for their preferred candidates and passed around memos debating the contenders' political weaknesses with key demographics.\n\nThey turned most sharply on one of the favorites to join the ticket, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who has drawn opposition from progressives and even a senator in his home state.\n\nThe fissures among Democrats emerged as three leading contenders -- Mr. Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with Ms. Harris at her residence in Washington on Sunday, ahead of a decision her campaign said would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, declined to comment on the Sunday meetings.\n\nMs. Harris is set to hit the campaign trail with her running mate this week, kicking off a five-day, seven-state tour with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia, where Mr. Shapiro is expected to be in attendance, whether he is her pick or not.\n\nProgressive groups have trained their criticisms on Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Kelly, who they accuse of being too conservative on key issues. Shawn Fain, the head of the United Autoworkers Union, said during a Sunday interview on CBS that Mr. Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged the union's concerns about his commitment to pro-labor legislation and that the organization had \"bigger issues\" with Mr. Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signaled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Ms. Harris's list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Mr. Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, have come out against Mr. Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on Israel's war in Gaza. The debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Mr. Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organizer called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Mr. Walz, who has become a favorite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed on Friday.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said that Mr. Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about Israel's war. \"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labor,\" he wrote in an email thread, which was shared with The Times. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSenator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has long clashed with Mr. Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Mr. Shapiro, a development that was first reported by Politico.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesman for Mr. Shapiro, declined to comment on the vice-presidential selection process.\n\nThe growing attacks on Mr. Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" issued a forceful defense of the Pennsylvania governor on X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade.\"\n\nA group of progressive donors in recent days has been making a push for the Mr. Walz, the Minnesota governor. Over the last week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Mr. Wimsatt have circulated a memo called \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President,\" hoping to sway Ms. Harris.\n\nA similar document touting Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who headlined a Harris fund-raiser in New Hampshire on Saturday, was circulated last week to Democrats, including major donors.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Mr. Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nMr. Shapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favorite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate like Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who has fans both among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee. Mr. Beshear has spent time over the last two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors who have been eager to kick the tires on him, including one invite-only session this past Friday evening, according to two people briefed on his activities.\n\nMr. Beshear was not known to have participated in Ms. Harris's final interviews Sunday, but he was spotted with his labradoodle, Winnie, outside the governor's residency in Frankfort, Ky.\n\n\"Just walking the dog this morning,\" Mr. Beshear responded when asked about his plans for the day.\n\nMr. Walz and Mr. Beshear are set to appear at dueling, simultaneous fund-raisers to benefit Ms. Harris on Monday evening in Minneapolis and Chicago, respectively. Mr. Walz's event was sold out as of Sunday evening; tickets remained available for Mr. Beshear's event.\n\nBy that point, Ms. Harris's decision is likely to already have been made.\n\nChristina Morales contributed reporting from Jenkintown, Pa., and Corinne Beyer contributed reporting from Frankfort, Ky.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_corasaniti@nytimes.com", "name": "Nick Corasaniti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "reid_j_epstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who has drawn opposition from progressives and even a senator in his home state.\n\nThe fissures among Democrats emerged as three leading contenders -- Mr. Shapiro, Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- met with Ms. Harris at her residence in Washington on Sunday, ahead of a decision her campaign said would be announced by Tuesday.\n\nKevin Munoz, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, declined to comment on the Sunday meetings.\n\nMs. Harris is set to hit the campaign trail with her running mate this week, kicking off a five-day, seven-state tour with a Tuesday night rally in Philadelphia, where Mr. Shapiro is expected to be in attendance, whether he is her pick or not.\n\nProgressive groups have trained their criticisms on Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Kelly, who they accuse of being too conservative on key issues. Shawn Fain, the head of the United Autoworkers Union, said during a Sunday interview on CBS that Mr. Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged the union's concerns about his commitment to pro-labor legislation and that the organization had \"bigger issues\" with Mr. Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signaled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Ms. Harris's list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Mr. Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, have come out against Mr. Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on Israel's war in Gaza. The debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Mr. Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organizer called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Mr. Walz, who has become a favorite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed on Friday.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said that Mr. Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about Israel's war. \"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labor,\" he wrote in an email thread, which was shared with The Times. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSenator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who has long clashed with Mr. Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Mr. Shapiro, a development that was first reported by Politico.\n\nManuel Bonder, a spokesman for Mr. Shapiro, declined to comment on the vice-presidential selection process.\n\nThe growing attacks on Mr. Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" issued a forceful defense of the Pennsylvania governor on X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade.\"\n\nA group of progressive donors in recent days has been making a push for the Mr. Walz, the Minnesota governor. Over the last week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Mr. Wimsatt have circulated a memo called \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President,\" hoping to sway Ms. Harris.\n\nA similar document touting Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary who headlined a Harris fund-raiser in New Hampshire on Saturday, was circulated last week to Democrats, including major donors.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Mr. Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nMr. Shapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favorite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate like Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, who has fans both among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee. Mr. Beshear has spent time over the last two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors who have been eager to kick the tires on him, including one invite-only session this past Friday evening, according to two people briefed on his activities.\n\nMr. Beshear was not known to have participated in Ms. Harris's final interviews Sunday, but he was spotted with his labradoodle, Winnie, outside the governor's residency in Frankfort, Ky.\n\n\"Just walking the dog this morning,\" Mr. Beshear responded when asked about his plans for the day.\n\nMr. Walz and Mr. Beshear are set to appear at dueling, simultaneous fund-raisers to benefit Ms. Harris on Monday evening in Minneapolis and Chicago, respectively. Mr. Walz's event was sold out as of Sunday evening; tickets remained available for Mr. Beshear's event.\n\nBy that point, Ms. Harris's decision is likely to already have been made.", "source": {"uri":

Josh Shapiro could potentially hurt Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign if chosen as her running mate.\n\nSingleton appeared on \"State of the Union\" to discuss Harris' running mate shortlist, as the vice president is reportedlyhosting final meetings with candidates. The CNN commentator called out Shapiro as potentially \"the worst\" choice Harris could make due to the effect it could have on her chances of winning Michigan.\n\n\"I want to touch on the Shapiro issue. I think out of all of the possibilities, he would potentially be the worst one if I'm looking at Michigan. You're seeing a resurfacing past -- \" Singleton began.\n\n\"Worse for Democrats or for Republicans?\" CNN host Dana Bash jumped in.\n\nSingleton continued to state how Harris' campaign could be affected by Michigan due to \"large percentage\" of Muslim voters who could abstain from voting the same way they did in February during President Joe Biden's primary.\n\n\"For Democrats and for vice president Harris to win the state of Michigan. Past statements are coming up about things he stated in the past about the Palestinian people. Some of his rulings as governor as it pertains to state workers and their potential advocacy which could thus lead them to being fired has caused quite the conundrum drumming criticism from younger progressives,\" Singleton said.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I think there's a large percentage of Muslims in the state of Michigan that would absolutely stay home. I went to look at some of those numbers in 2020 compared to now, the vice president cannot afford to lose a substantial number of them,\" Singleton continued. \"So I would look at someone else if I were Democrats, I don't think that would be the best pick strategically.\"\n\nBash pointed out, however, Shapiro's stance on protests, the Middle East, Israel and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are \"almost identical\" to other running mate options, with the \"only difference\" being the Democratic governor is Jewish. The CNN host asked Singleton if Harris should \"give in to that,\" to which the political commentator highlighted the \"appearance\" of \"anti-zionism\" within parts of the party.\n\n\"Well, you know where I stand on that issue. I'm as pro-Israel as they come -- you and I have had many conversations about that. But I think that it speaks to a bit of the problem with younger progressive Democrats and the ceasefire. I think likely we will see protests returned again to college campuses. You and I have had those conversations,\" Singleton said. \"I certainly don't think it's a good thing, but it showcases within the Democratic Party, there is at least, and I wouldn't say broadly speaking, but there is the appearance of some level of anti-zionism. I'll put it that way at best, and that's a problem.\"\n\nHarris reportedly held meetings with a half-dozen options over the weekend as she is expected to make the formal announcement of her choice within the upcoming days, according to the Associated Press. In addition to Shapiro, some of Harris' options also include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the outlet reported.\n\nPush back against the Pennsylvania governor has come forward from other party lawmakers. Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman allegedly has major concerns with Shapiro joining Harris' campaign, as he reportedly believes the governor is focused on his own personal ambitions, three sources told Politico.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman additionally was called out online after endorsing only Waltz and Beshear after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer withdrew her name from consideration, with some users labeling the move as antisemitism.\n\nFeatured Image Credit: Screenshot/Grabien/CNN\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Tim Walz are the union's top two picks for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, though he noted that the decision is hers to make.\n\n\"Those would be our top two if we had to pick any,\" Fain said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"That's who we believe would be best for labor and for working class people but you know, that's her decision.\"\n\nHarris is expected to announce her running mate by Tuesday.

And regarding Kelly, Fain said the Arizona senator's recent support for legislation that provides more protection for unions isn't enough to assuage concerns about his record.\n\nStill, Fain said that even if Harris taps someone viewed as less favorable for labor, \"Kamala Harris is for labor.\"\n\n\"Kamala Harris is about the people and that's what this election is about,\" he added. \"And that's why I believe that people will vote for Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThe UAW endorsed Harris last week after previously endorsing President Biden before he opted to step aside. Fain said Harris has done a number of things to earn the endorsement, like appearing on picket lines \"before it was a popular thing to do.\" He added that the union looks at the body of work between the candidates, contrasting it with former President Donald Trump's record.\n\n\"When you put Kamala Harris and Donald Trump side by side, there's a very telling difference in who stands with working class people and who left working class people behind,\" Fain said.\n\nHarris is expected to meet with UAW members and leaders in Detroit this week while on a campaign swing across seven battleground states, accompanied by her soon-to-be announced running mate.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It needs to be progressive.", "body": "Vice President Kamala Harris is having a good month. She's leading former President Donald Trump in the polls after setting fundraising records, making appearances on \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" and taking over social media.\n\nShe's also close to making her decision on who will win the veepstakes. It's a decision that could continue her presidential campaign's momentum. Harris is supposed to announce her running mate before a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. There's no official short list, but a handful of candidates across the country are in the process of being vetted.\n\nWhoever Harris picks will determine whether the campaign leans into her more progressive stances or tries to appeal to moderates in the party. As someone who wants to see the Dems move toward the future, I hope her eventual pick is someone with whom she can champion bold, progressive ideas.\n\nDemocrats are at an inflection point. If they really intend to move the party forward - and win over young, disaffected voters in the process - they can set themselves up for success in November. Given the enthusiasm she's earned over the past few weeks, I think it's time for the Democratic Party to embrace change and, for once, try something other than appealing to the middle.\n\nLast year, with a Democratic majority in both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature, Walz codified the right to abortion into law, signed off on universal free school meals, legalized recreational marijuana and restored voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nNot to mention, he's the one who started the recent phenomenon of calling Republicans \"weird.\"\n\nWho will Harris pick for VP? Republicans, pay attention to who Harris picks for VP. One of them should scare us.\n\nChoosing Walz would be an inspired choice that would solidify Harris' standing with progressives, and his Midwestern sensibilities would be perfect for taking on Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance.\n\nHe's also the strongest choice when it comes to abortion rights, an issue that the Harris campaign is putting at the forefront. If Harris picks Walz, it will signal to the rest of the party that the younger faction is determined to be more progressive than the current iteration of the party.\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is another option that could take on Vance and mobilize a part of the country Democrats traditionally struggle with. Beshear has done what he could as a Democratic governor in a red state and won reelection by focusing on the abortion rights battle. Like Walz, he reinstated voting rights for formerly incarcerated people.\n\nWhile Beshear isn't where progressives want him to be on abortion - he often chooses to emphasize the most extreme reasons for needing one, and his lieutenant governor pick has described herself as pro-life - he proved that reproductive freedom is a winning issue for Democrats no matter the state.\n\nU.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is, according to multiple polls, the most well-known of Harris' short list. The former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who suffered a head injury in a 2011 mass shooting, is a vocal supporter of commonsense gun laws. He's also taken Trump to task over the failed bipartisan immigration reform bill from earlier this year.\n\nOn the other hand, Kelly failed to co-sponsor a crucial piece of legislation that would have made it easier for workers to unionize - that is, until he was added to the VP short list.\n\nOf all the candidates, Kelly is the one I'm most on the fence about. His strength on the border complements Harris' shortfalls, but his failure to support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act is definitely disappointing. He'd be a fine choice, but not someone I'd be ecstatic over.\n\nTrump does love racism: Trump's lazy racism against Harris won't earn him votes. He already has racists in the bag.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has been criticized for his response to the pro-Palestinian protests earlier this year.\n\nShapiro, who is Jewish, has said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a \"terrible leader\" but has also compared some pro-Palestinian protesters to the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nUnfortunately, those aren't the only issues with the Pennsylvania governor. He's also a supporter of school choice voucher programs - a traditionally conservative idea. He's also been accused by some in his home state of staying silent on a sexual harassment investigation last year of a former aide.\n\nOn the other hand, Shapiro could help Democrats win Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states this election cycle. Picking him would be a sign that the party is still trying to appeal to centrists instead of being bold. As someone invested in this country's future, I would find that disappointing.\n\nApropos of political leanings, I am still a little sad that North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper withdrew his name from the veepstakes. Cooper may not be particularly progressive, but he has a moderate liberal record that I think would do well with the majority of Americans.\n\nSadly, it means that the rest of the country will lose out on seeing the Andy Griffith costume Cooper wears on Halloween - but it probably means he's eyeing a 2026 Senate run.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

She's already garnering enough support to pull ahead of the polls and make up for lost time. Democrats should pick someone who is thinking about the future of the party and the future of the country.\n\nHarris needs to keep rallying her base and energizing young voters. The wrong choice could haunt her on Election Day.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Sara Peque\u00f1o on X, formerly Twitter, @sara__pequeno\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our USA TODAY

This crucial step comes as Harris looks to solidify her ticket for the 2024 presidential election, following President Joe Biden's decision to step aside.\n\nAmong those scheduled to meet with Harris are Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.These meetings will serve as a critical test of compatibility between Harris and her potential running mates, as she evaluates who can bolster her campaign, reflect her values, and be ready to step into the presidency if needed.\n\nThe in-person meeting, described as a \"chemistry test,\" is a final step in the search, but one that Harris is expected to put considerable stock in.\n\nEach candidate brings a unique set of strengths and political experience to the table.\n\nMark Kelly\n\nThe former astronaut and Arizona Senator has a high-profile background and has shown strong electoral success in a key swing state.\n\nHis military service and commitment to issues like gun control make him a formidable candidate, though his stance on immigration and labor issues has drawn some criticism from within the Democratic base.\n\nTim Walz\n\nThe Minnesota Governor offers a mix of executive and legislative experience. Known for his Midwest sensibility and down-to-earth appeal, Walz has a background in the Army National Guard and education.\n\nDespite his strengths, his home state is not a key battleground, which may limit his strategic value in the general election.\n\nJosh Shapiro\n\nThe Pennsylvania Governor, a former attorney general, could be a strategic pick due to his strong ties to a critical swing state. Shapiro's blue-collar appeal and significant electoral success in 2022 position him as a candidate who could help Harris win over Rust Belt voters. However, his support for school vouchers and past controversies pose potential hurdles.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the current US Transportation Secretary, and Andy Beshear, the Democratic Governor of Kentucky, are also rumored to be under consideration.\n\nButtigieg, known for his policy expertise and strong communication skills, could tie the ticket closely to Biden's administration, while Beshear's appeal as a Democrat in a deep-red state might help Harris connect with more conservative voters.\n\nAs the clock ticks down, Harris must weigh these options carefully, considering not just the political impact but also the chemistry and working relationship she could have with her vice-presidential choice. With the general election looming, this decision will be one of the most critical of her campaign, shaping the Democratic ticket as it faces off against Donald Trump in November.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Past statements are coming up about things he stated in the past about the Palestinian people. Some of his rulings as governor as it pertains to state workers and their potential advocacy which could thus lead them to being fired has caused quite the conundrum drumming criticism from younger progressives,\" Singleton said.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I think there's a large percentage of Muslims in the state of Michigan that would absolutely stay home. I went to look at some of those numbers in 2020 compared to now, the vice president cannot afford to lose a substantial number of them,\" Singleton continued. \"So I would look at someone else if I were Democrats, I don't think that would be the best pick strategically.\"\n\nBash pointed out, however, Shapiro's stance on protests, the Middle East, Israel and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are \"almost identical\" to other running mate options, with the \"only difference\" being the Democratic governor is Jewish. The CNN host asked Singleton if Harris should \"give in to that,\" to which the political commentator highlighted the \"appearance\" of \"anti-zionism\" within parts of the party.\n\n\"Well, you know where I stand on that issue. I'm as pro-Israel as they come -- you and I have had many conversations about that. But I think that it speaks to a bit of the problem with younger progressive Democrats and the ceasefire. I think likely we will see protests returned again to college campuses. You and I have had those conversations,\" Singleton said. \"I certainly don't think it's a good thing, but it showcases within the Democratic Party, there is at least, and I wouldn't say broadly speaking, but there is the appearance of some level of anti-zionism. I'll put it that way at best, and that's a problem.\"\n\nHarris reportedly held meetings with a half-dozen options over the weekend as she is expected to make the formal announcement of her choice within the upcoming days, according to the Associated Press. In addition to Shapiro, some of Harris' options also include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the outlet reported.\n\nPush back against the Pennsylvania governor has come forward from other party lawmakers. Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman allegedly has major concerns with Shapiro joining Harris' campaign, as he reportedly believes the governor is focused on his own personal ambitions, three sources told Politico.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman additionally was called out online after endorsing only Waltz and Beshear after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer withdrew her name from consideration, with some users labeling the move as antisemitism.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

While betting markets are not definitive indicators of political outcomes, they often reflect insider information and public sentiment, making them a closely watched barometer in political circles.\n\nOther notable contenders include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, whose odds have improved to +900, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear at +1400. Both have been touted for their ability to win in traditionally Republican-leaning states, a quality that could prove valuable in a national campaign.\n\nThe surge in odds for Shapiro and Walz has overshadowed other potential candidates who were once considered strong contenders. Former presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg now stands at +3500, while Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's odds have lengthened to +15000.\n\nThese shifts in betting odds come on the heels of comments made by renowned election predictor Allan Lichtman, who recently identified Shapiro and Kelly as favorable choices for Harris. Lichtman, known for his accurate predictions in nine of the past ten presidential elections, emphasized the importance of selecting a running mate who could be trusted to assume the presidency if necessary.\n\nLichtman's focus on Pennsylvania's importance in the electoral map aligns with Shapiro's strong position in the betting odds. Pennsylvania counts for 19 Electoral College votes and no Democratic candidate has won the election without the Keystone State since Harry Truman in 1948. Pennsylvania has voted Democrat in every election since 1992, save 2016, when Donald Trump beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nSeparately, for the first time since launching her presidential campaign, Kamala Harris is predicted to win the 2024 election, according to the online prediction market PredictIt. The platform shows Harris as the favorite to win in November, with shares of a Harris victory being sold for 52 cents, while shares for a Donald Trump victory are being sold at 50 cents.\n\nHowever, other betting platforms show that Trump maintains a lead over Harris. On the Polymarket betting platform, Trump has 55 percent odds compared to Harris' 43 percent, though his lead has shrunk since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.\n\nRecent polls have shown Harris reducing Trump's lead compared to when Biden was on the ticket. A Morning Consult poll conducted after Biden ended his campaign showed the former president only 2 points ahead of Harris, a narrower margin than the 4-point lead he held over Biden in a previous survey.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adeola_adeosun@newsweek.com", "name": "Adeola Adeosun", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Lichtman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allan Lichtman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry S.

Josh Shapiro speaks with press along with Vice President Kamala Harris during their visit to Little Thai Market at Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia on July 13, 2024.\n\nWhoever Vice President Kamala Harris selects to be her running mate might not have a major impact on voters across the country, but he or she could prove pivotal in their home state, political experts said.\n\nIn the case of candidates in swing states such as Pennsylvania or Arizona, Harris' decision could have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in November.\n\nBerwood Yost, who oversees polling at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, said top contenders such as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly could make a big difference in the election outcome if they can help the Democratic ticket win their closely contested states.\n\n\"If you pick someone in a tightly contested state and it gives you even a minor boost, it could make a big difference,\" Yost said.\n\nThat could be particularly true in Pennsylvania, a state that could put a candidate \"over the top\" to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to secure the White House, Yost said.\n\nCandidates for vice president have only a modest impact on voters, who are most concerned with the top of the ticket, said Chris Borick, a political science professor at Muhlenburg College in Allentown.\n\nBut in swing states, where the presidential race could be decided by the thinnest of margins, even a small impact can be critical, Borick said.\n\n\"In places like Pennsylvania that have been decided by a point or less in recent elections, a vice president choice that does have some modest impact on voter preferences could have a much more meaningful impact on the overall outcome of the race,\" Borick said.\n\nWith Shapiro considered a top candidate for the spot, Borick said, Harris might be hoping to use a native son of the Keystone State to clinch its crucial 19 electoral votes.\n\nPennsylvania, Borick said, is \"almost a necessity\" for Harris to win the White House in November.\n\n\"If your goal is to win Pennsylvania -- and Shapiro can help you do that -- of course you would give him deep consideration for the nod,\" Borick said.\n\nThe candidate who won Pennsylvania won the White House eight times in the past 10 presidential elections.\n\nGeorge Mifflin Dallas, the only vice president from Pennsylvania, secured his home state's votes to help lead President James Polk to victory in the 1844 election.\n\nRecent polling shows the presidential race having tightened since President Joe Biden dropped out and Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nHarris has gained on Republican nominee Donald Trump in six of seven swing states, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll.\n\nHarris leads Trump in Michigan by 11 percentage points and 2 points in Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada, according to the poll conducted July 24-28. Trump leads Harris by 4 percentage points in Pennsylvania and 2 points in North Carolina. They are tied in Georgia.\n\nIn recent races, vice president candidates have often won their home states. Since 2000, only two vice presidential hopefuls -- Democrat John Edwards of North Carolina and Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- have seen their home states opt for the opposing party in the presidential race.\n\nBut correlation doesn't equate to causation, cautioned Kristen Coopie, director of pre-law at Duquesne University and a political science professor.\n\nIn many instances, she said, candidates have picked a running mate from a state that already was essentially guaranteed to lean toward that party. Those states would have voted the same way, even if the vice president wasn't from the state.\n\n\"You certainly can't count on the entire state going for you because you picked a native son,\" Coopie said.\n\nStill, she said, it can help.\n\nVice presidents from key swing states can help mobilize voters close to home, rally political organizations behind the ticket and guide the presidential candidate in how best to resonate with a voting base they already know well, she said.\n\nThat's what former President Donald Trump is hoping running mate J.D. Vance can do in his native Ohio, Coopie said -- and it's likely something Harris will consider for her own pick.\n\nThere are other benefits a running mate can bring to the table beyond a boost in their home state, experts said.\n\nSelecting someone more moderate could signal to voters a willingness to collaborate with people of all political persuasions. Candidates can be crucial for campaigning by acting as a surrogate when the presidential nominee can't be everywhere at once.

Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers, said during a Sunday (Monday AEST) interview on CBS that Senator Kelly had \"not really\" assuaged concerns about his commitment to pro-labour legislation and that the organisation had \"bigger issues\" with Mr Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nMajor Democratic donors have signalled that they would be fine with any of the candidates on Ms Harris' list of finalists, but there are divisions among the biggest Democratic givers. A vigorous debate has been waged on an email group for the Democracy Alliance, where left-wing donors have expressed concerns about Mr Shapiro.\n\nAnother group of progressive activists, communicating through an email group called Gamechanger Salon, has come out against Mr Shapiro and pushed its members to highlight his stances on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe debate grew heated during a discussion about whether using the phrase \"Genocide Josh\" to describe Mr Shapiro, who is an observant Jew, was antisemitic. An organiser called for calm and rebranded the email chain, \"Why Josh Shapiro should not be the VP.\" Some of the emails also called for members to push for Mr Walz, who has become a favourite of the party's most liberal contributors, about 60 of whom he addressed last week.\n\nOne message, written by Billy Wimsatt, an executive director of a liberal donor group known as the Movement Voter Project, said Mr Shapiro could cause a drop in turnout among progressive voters who are concerned about the war.\n\n\"He risks significantly depressing enthusiasm for the Harris ticket among key constituencies of young voters, Arab and Muslim voters, and to some degree labour,\" he wrote in an email thread. \"Tim Walz is the perfect Harris VP unicorn for this moment.\"\n\nSenator John Fetterman, who has long clashed with Mr Shapiro, has also expressed displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket, according to two people who have spoken with him. One of his advisers called the Harris campaign to object to Mr Shapiro, a development first reported by Politico.\n\nThe growing attacks on Mr Shapiro have been rebuked by some moderates in the party and others in the media. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's Morning Joe, issued a forceful defence of the Pennsylvania governor on the social platform X, saying the recent attacks on him were \"a toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues who don't want to be blocked out of the presidential sweepstakes for the next decade\".\n\nA group of progressive donors has pushed for Mr Walz. Over the past week, Democratic operatives including Doran Schrantz, an adviser to Faith in Minnesota PAC, and Mr Wimsatt have circulated a memo called The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President, hoping to sway Mr Harris.\n\nSenator Kelly posted to social media, then subsequently deleted, a message that curiously said he would now be focused on his home state.\n\n\"My background is a bit different than most politicians.\" Senator Kelly wrote. \"I spent my life serving in the Navy and at NASA, where the mission always comes first. Now, my mission is serving Arizonans.\"\n\nSenator Kelly's spokesperson, Jacob Peters, said the post was deleted because it was being misunderstood.\n\nMr Shapiro has emerged as the choice of the party's pro-Israel donors, those with ties to the school-choice movement and business-friendly contributors in Silicon Valley. But his centrist positions that appeal to those groups are the same ones that make him the least favourite of the party's most liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate such as Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who has fans among the party's more liberal and more centrist contributors, also could emerge as nominee.\n\nMr Beshear has spent time over the past two weeks auditioning before multiple groups of major donors.", "source": {"uri": "afr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Financial Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In short, it must be a white man so as not to scare off the moderate American electorate. The selection process for the US vice-presidential candidate who will be invited to campaign alongside Harris, a Californian woman with a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, was in its final phase on Sunday, August 4. The candidate's name could be announced as early as Monday, just before a major electoral tour starting Tuesday evening in Pennsylvania and then Wednesday in Wisconsin, two decisive swing states that Donald Trump won in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nOn Sunday, Harris met with at least three of the contenders - Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, 51; Arizona senator Mark Kelly, 60; and Minnesota governor Tim Walz, 60, who are considered favorites - at her residence at the US Naval Observatory in Washington, according to American media. She also met with Federal Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, 42, for an hour and a half on Friday, according to Reuters. It is not known whether Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, 46, and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, 59, have spoken directly with the Democratic candidate for the US presidential election in November.\n\nThe aim of these meetings is to assess the \"chemistry,\" the personal bond between the possible president and her future vice president. According to her advisers, quoted by the New York Times, Harris places decisive importance on personal relationships. To meet her, the main contenders all canceled the events they were supposed to attend, in particular Shapiro, who was due to raise funds in the Hamptons, the chic residence of wealthy New Yorkers on Long Island.\n\nFor the past 10 days, the selection of potential candidates has been anything but about chemistry. They have undergone a ruthless selection and vetting process, mostly by videoconference, usually stretching over weeks or even months. The review was overseen by former Attorney General Eric Holder and his team of attorneys at Covington & Burling. The choice of Holder confirmed former president Barack Obama's renewed hold on the Democratic camp. This African-American Bronx native served as US Attorney General under the former president from 2009 to 2015. The aim of the exercise was to identify any flaws in the future vice-presidential candidate that could torpedo the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe process was very thorough.

Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.\n\nVice presidential candidates are often chosen to add something to the ticket that the top candidate lacks, such as geographical or demographic identity or the ability to help win a swing state.\n\nAn added factor in this case is that Harris is a latecomer to the race, according to Aaron Dusso, a professor of political science at the University of Indiana, Indianapolis.\n\n\"That means voters will be learning a lot about her over the next three months,\" Dusso told The Epoch Times. \"[They] will be learning about both of them at the same time, and that could make this vice presidential pick more impactful than is normally the case.\"\n\nHe has a 49 percent approval rating in a state that is evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. Candidate Joe Biden won Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes by 0.2 percentage points in 2020.\n\n\"[Shapiro] gives them a fighting chance in Pennsylvania, and that's the ballgame,\" political strategist Kevin Sheridan told The Epoch Times. But that comes with a drawback: Many Democrats see the governor as insufficiently concerned about the plight of Palestinian people in Gaza.\n\n\"The downside for Democrats is if he reignites the Hamas wing of the party and they get major protests and violence in Chicago,\" Sheridan said, referring to the upcoming party convention in the Windy City.\n\nShapiro graduated from Georgetown University Law Center. In 2004, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature, flipping a seat Republicans had held for decades. He later became the first Democrat since the Civil War to chair the Montgomery County Commission.\n\nElected as the state's attorney general in 2016, he prosecuted more than 6,500 drug dealers and seized more than 1.5 million doses of fentanyl.\n\nA potential liability for Kelly is that World View Enterprises, a company he cofounded in 2012, received investment funding from the Chinese tech company Tencent. World View Enterprises, which provides aerial surveillance balloons and other technology to both the U.S. military and private businesses, says Kelly no longer has any connection with it.\n\nKelly was a U.S. Navy combat pilot and NASA astronaut before his election to the U.S. Senate in 2020.\n\nAfter joining NASA in 1996 with his twin brother, Scott, Kelly flew four missions on the Space Shuttle Endeavor in 2001 before commanding its last mission in 2011, spending a total of 50 days in space through his career.\n\n\"When you're looking down from space at Earth, it really puts it into perspective that we're all in this together,\" he said about his career at NASA.\n\nIn 2018, Beshear was elected governor of Kentucky, in which Republicans have a supermajority in both houses of the state's General Assembly.\n\n\"Adding a person who is from the South would help give the ticket geographic balance,\" according to Dusso. \"He would be an interesting choice that moves a bit outside what would be considered 'safe.'\"\n\nHowever, Kentucky is not a swing state. It has opted for Republican candidates in each of the last six presidential elections.\n\nIn Beshear's first term as governor, he announced $29 billion in private-sector investments for nearly 1,000 economic development projects to create roughly 51,300 full-time jobs.\n\nHe worked to create the $500 million Cleaner Water Program to provide clean drinking water to thousands in the state for the first time.\n\nPrior to that, he served as the state's attorney general and sued former Gov. Matt Bevin multiple times over alleged abuse of executive powers. He secured a $17 million settlement with the Bayer Corporation over claims of misleading women about blood clot risks associated with birth control drugs.\n\nMinnesota is one of the most reliably Democrat states in presidential elections -- it hasn't voted for a Republican in 52 years.\n\nLike Beshear, Walz was suggested by the nearly 50 progressive leaders who urged Harris not to select Shapiro as her running mate.\n\nWalz is an Army National Guard veteran and former high school teacher. He served six terms in Congress beginning in 2007 and was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in the U.S. Congress. He was rated the 7th most bipartisan representative in the 114th Congress by the Lugar Center at Georgetown University.\n\nWalz spearheaded a plan to provide universal free school meals, has pushed to get Minnesota on 100 percent \"clean electricity\" by 2040, and expanded paid leave for workers. He also worked to preserve Minnesota's Health Care Access Fund and lowered taxes on seniors and small businesses.\n\nHe gained significant name recognition through his 2020 presidential campaign, in which he won the Democratic Iowa caucuses, after ultimately becoming a cabinet member in the Biden administration. According to Dusso, he's also a good public speaker.\n\nButtigieg lives in Michigan, a swing state that Democrats carried by 2.8 percentage points in 2020. The state now has 15 electoral votes.\n\nHowever, Buttigieg's Michigan roots do not run deep. He relocated there in 2021 after serving as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020.\n\n\"I don't see any upside to putting Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the ticket,\" Darling said, noting that he has little executive experience.\n\nHe briefly ran for Democratic National Committee chairman in 2017 but eventually withdrew from the race.\n\nAs transportation secretary, Buttigieg has supported Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act, introduced a national roadway safety strategy, and awarded more than $9.5 billion through more than 800 projects to enhance transportation in communities nationwide.\n\nHarris is expected to announce her selection at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Aug. 6 at 7 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Head to head, Harris is at 50 percent and Trump is at 49 percent -- well within the nationwide poll's 2.1-point margin of error. With third-party candidates included, Harris sits at 49 percent, Trump at 47 percent and ROBERT F. KENNEDY at 2 percent.\n\nSHOTGUN VEEPSTAKES -- Harris meets today with finalists on her shortlist for a running mate -- a series of face-to-face sit-downs that her team is describing as a \"chemistry test\" with the person who will be her No. 2.\n\nHarris will meet at the Naval Observatory with Pennsylvania Gov. JOSH SHAPIRO, Sen. MARK KELLY (D-Ariz.) and Minnesota Gov TIM WALZ. The former two contenders have been considered the favorites in recent weeks by well-sourced reporters, while the Minnesotan has emerged as a dark-horse candidate quickly winning over the hearts of Democrats just getting to know him.\n\nHarris, we remind you, is expected to make her choice sometime tomorrow before hitting the campaign trail with her running mate, capping off a two-week frenzy during which President JOE BIDEN decided to end his reelection campaign and Harris got her own effort up and running.\n\nThe meetings will be critical for Harris' decision, as the VP is prioritizing someone she views as a governing partner rather than just one who could help land a critical swing state.\n\nFormer AG ERIC HOLDER and a team of lawyers from Covington & Burling -- who've been working to vet the candidates -- delivered presentations to Harris on their backgrounds and potential upsides and vulnerabilities,WaPo's Tyler Pager reports. Harris has also tapped LIZ ALLEN, a top State Department official (and Harris' comms director on the 2020 Biden-Harris ticket), to become the VP candidate's chief of staff.\n\nThe rumor mill of who's up and who's down has been swirling all week. Here's the latest:\n\nWhile most Democrats are betting on Shapiro -- who has won more votes in the critical battleground than any gubernatorial candidate in Keystone State history and outperformed Biden in 2020 -- one of the governor's political rivals is trying to sabotage his chances.\n\nAdvisers to Democratic Sen. JOHN FETTERMAN, Shapiro's longtime home-state rival, have reached out to Harris' team to relay the senator's concerns about Shapiro,our Holly Otterbein scoops. These concerns, notably, center not on electoral worries, but on the fact Fetterman thinks Shapiro \"is excessively focused on his own personal ambitions.\"\n\nThe pair rose on parallel tracks in Pennsylvania -- one as a relative centrist, the other as a progressive. But they especially butted heads while serving on Pennsylvania's Board of Pardons, where Fetterman took a more lenient position than Shapiro in providing second chances to some convicts. (Though if we're being honest here, and Harris truly wants to win over swing voters and Trump-skeptical Republicans, Shapiro's tougher-on-crime position would likely be a benefit, not a drawback.)\n\nThe knifing comes as progressive activists are increasingly vocalizing their concerns about Shapiro and Kelly, warning that selecting either could undercut Democrats' newfound party unity, AP's Will Weissert writes. Unions are making their discomfort with Kelly widely known over his resistance to policies favored by organized labor, while pro-Palestinian groups are pushing back on Shapiro for his handling of Gaza protests.\n\nWho stands to gain from the last minute second-guessing? Walz.\n\nThe good-natured Minnesota governor is getting \"a renewed focus,\" CNN's Jeff Zeleny, MJ Lee and Jamie Gangel reported late last night -- though they offered scant details beyond that.\n\nIndeed, Walz appears to have captured the attention of Democrats across the spectrum. Progressives are drawn to what the Times called his \"folksy takedowns\" of Trump. Centrists see an appeal in his Midwestern dad vibes. One fun read on that front: From his obsession with Diet Mountain Dew to his fluency in Mandarin after teaching English in China 35 years ago, read this Star Tribune piece about Walz.\n\nGood Sunday morning.

Our view is, there are countries around the world that wish to do us harm. And some of the ways in which they try to do us harm is by catching American citizens up in what can be geopolitical or other disputes. We do not think that it is responsible or the right thing to do for American interests to leave those people in harm's way.\"\n\n-- Rep. NANCY PELOSI (D-Calif.) on the violent attack on her husband, on \"CBS News Sunday Morning\": \"My husband and I have never talked about this ... The doctors have supported that, because they don't want him to revisit it. ... He was looking for me ... Imagine the guilt of all of that -- it's just a horrible thing.\"\n\n-- Sen. LAPHONZA BUTLER (D-Calif.) on Trump's attacks on Harris' race, on CNN's \"State of the Union\": \"This is an absolute distraction. It is an insult. It is despicable. This is a woman who was born in Oakland, California, who has declared and lived proudly all of her identities her entire life, embracing the totality of who she is. ... This is the only card he's got to play, and so he's playing it. He's desperate.\"\n\n-- Sen. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.) on those Trump comments, on \"Fox News Sunday\": \"Here's what I would say to President Trump: The problem I have with Kamala Harris is not her heritage, [it's] her judgment. She has been wrong about everything. When she tried to explain what she would do about inflation and an upcoming recession, it made no sense. ... Every day we're talking about her heritage and not her terrible, dangerous liberal record throughout her entire political life [is] a good day for her and a bad day for us.\"\n\nTOP-EDS: A roundup of the week's must-read opinion pieces.\n\n1. PERSONAL HISTORY: The Harris campaign was hit with its first personal scandal when the Daily Mail's Josh Boswell and Emma James scooped that second gentleman DOUG EMHOFF had cheated on his first wife, KERSTIN, with their kids' nanny/teacher, helping contribute to the end of the marriage. They also reported that Emhoff got her pregnant, but she didn't keep the baby.\n\nIn response, Emhoff issued a statement to CNN's Isaac Dovere acknowledging that his first marriage \"went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.\" He reports that all the drama predates Harris, and has long been known to the Biden and Harris teams. And Kerstin Emhoff stood up for their family in a statement too, saying that \"Doug and I decided to end our marriage for a variety of reasons, many years ago. He is a great father to our kids [and] continues to be a great friend to me.\"\n\n2. TRUMP VEERS OFF SCRIPT: Trump's campaign may be running a much tighter, smoother operation this time around, but the candidate still can't help himself sometimes. His baseless attacks on Harris' race have damaged his team's plan to take on and define Harris, WSJ's Alex Leary and Vivian Salama report. His controversies are putting Senate Republicans back in the familiarly uncomfortable position of being made to answer for him, WaPo's Paul Kane writes. And Trump is continuing to pick off-topic or off-the-cuff fights:\n\n3. JUST VANCE: Sen. JD VANCE's (R-Ohio) old remarks about women and childlessness have stirred up an unhelpful hornet's nest with independent voters, WaPo's Maeve Reston finds in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where his comments were even more top of mind than interest in Harris' launch. Notably, the controversy is reviving old concerns about Trump's treatment of women and his position on abortion -- especially now that he's running against a woman. Vance's place on the ticket is bringing renewed scrutiny to his concerns about no-fault divorce, as WaPo's Emily Wax-Thibodeaux writes.\n\nOther parts of Vance's history and beliefs are coming into focus, too. WaPo's Dan Lamothe and Alex Horton talk to his old Marine buddies, who generally laud his military service and say it should be off-limits from political attacks, even as some of them are baffled by his hard-right turn. Perhaps most consequentially, NYT's Matt Flegenheimer dives into Vance's views about the use of power. He has been unchanging recently in the assertion that Republicans must use every opportunity possible to assert dominance, even if it stretches the Constitution and democracy, \"insisting that these zero-sum times require a zero-sum strategy.\"\n\n4. LATEST FROM TANYA CHUTKAN: \"Judge rejects Trump's claim of 'vindictive' prosecution by Biden allies,\" by Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney: \"In a 16-page opinion, Chutkan swept aside Trump's attempt to dismiss his Washington, D.C., criminal case ... over claims that President Joe Biden pressured prosecutors to target his political rival. In the ruling, Chutkan said Trump repeatedly mischaracterized the charges against him, which describe far more than simply criminalizing his claimed belief that the 2020 election was stolen. Rather, Chutkan ruled, the charges describe a sweeping attempt to manipulate and lie to government authorities in order to undermine the lawful 2020 election results.\"\n\n5. HARRIS REVS UP: As the Democratic base comes back to Harris and the election returns to the familiar set of battleground states, she's adding more staffers to the Sun Belt and other swing states, Reuters' Stephanie Kelly reports. \"In the next two weeks, the campaign will add 150 more staff in the 'Blue Wall,' and will more than double its staff in Arizona and North Carolina, [DAN] KANNINEN said.\" Today, Harris is launching a new \"Republicans for Harris\" campaign to try to win over GOP voters, AP's Zeke Miller scooped.\n\nHarris is also gathering steam with some key demographic groups. In some polling, she has reversed Trump's advantage with low-income voters, Bloomberg's Amara Omeokwe, Mark Niquette and Jeff Green report. And she's reenergized South Asian American voters, which could be especially important in Georgia, per NYT's Isabelle Qian and Alex Pena.\n\nMore Harris reading: \"Here Are Kamala Harris's Closest Confidantes on Wall Street,\" by WSJ's Lauren Thomas: \"The vice president retains closer ties to the finance world than many realize.\"\n\n6. BIG INVESTIGATION: \"With Smugglers and Front Companies, China Is Skirting American A.I. Bans,\" by NYT's Ana Swanson and Claire Fu: \"Beginning in October 2022, the United States set up one of the most extensive technological blockades ever attempted: banning the export to China of A.I. chips and the machinery to make them. ... But given the vast profits at stake, businesses around the world have found ways to skirt the restrictions.\"\n\nMore China reading: \"The U.S. Has Been Spending Billions to Revive Manufacturing. But China Is in Another League,\" by WSJ's Jason Douglas and Clarence Leong ... \"Chinese Migrants Rush to Find Way to U.S. Border Before Doors Close,\" by WSJ's Wenxin Fan\n\n7. HERE COMES ROBERT LIGHTHIZER: \"He's the rare Trump adviser to survive the first term. He's poised to be even more influential in a second,\" by Gavin Bade: \"If Trump wins in November, Lighthizer is poised to pursue an even more disruptive set of policies next year, one that is already raising alarms in foreign capitals, on Wall Street and among many economists. ... Lighthizer is a candidate for a number of senior roles in a second Trump administration, from Treasury or Commerce secretary to a second turn as USTR, or as an economic adviser or even White House chief of staff. ... Even rarer, he is one who has friends on both sides of the aisle.\"\n\n8. THE SWAP STORY: As the dust settles around the major deal to bring Gershkovich and other detainees home from Russia, NYT's Anton Troianovski and Mark Mazzetti have a behind-the-scenes look at how it unfolded. The transfer was beset by fears in the West that something would go awry up to the moment it happened. And for the people who were released from Russia, the sudden shift in fortunes produced some emotional whiplash -- even some fear that their lives might be ending.\n\nEverybody is already spinning a narrative that will be most favorable to them, Nahal Toosi, Erin Banco and J\u00fcrgen Kl\u00f6ckner report. That includes different countries and even different agencies: Some at the State Department aren't thrilled with the NSC for taking all the credit. \"[W]hich narrative dominates over time can make a difference in who wins elections, whether governments keep using hostage-taking as a pressure tactic and whether such exchanges can happen again.\"\n\n9. BATTLE FOR THE SENATE: \"How Sherrod Brown is navigating Harris' candidacy in GOP-leaning Ohio with Senate control at stake,\" by CNN's Manu Raju and Haley Talbot in Brooklyn, Ohio: \"Sen. SHERROD BROWN doesn't plan to campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris. He plans to skip the Democratic National Convention. And the Democratic senator isn't going to defend Harris' record -- or offer praise to President Joe Biden or to Harris over their handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, Brown ... is making this calculation: finding a way to disqualify his opponent, BERNIE MORENO, in the eyes of GOP-leaning voters and independents.\"\n\nIN MEMORIAM -- \"Ina Jaffe, Dogged and Award-Winning NPR Reporter, Dies at 75,\" by NYT's Emmett Lindner: \"Ms. Jaffe spent decades covering politics and aging in America, and she was the first editor of the NPR program 'Weekend Edition Saturday.'\"\n\nTRANSITIONS -- Samantha Hawkins is now comms adviser for infrastructure and the Investing in America agenda at the White House. She previously was director of public affairs at the Federal Highway Administration. Dominic Hawkins is now VP of comms at NAACP. He previously was director of PR at TIAA. (The two, both SKDK alums, got married earlier this year.)\n\nWEDDINGS -- Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Mindy Noce, an interior designer, got married yesterday in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. They met when \"a mutual friend at Seacoast Church set them up,\" The Post and Courier's Caitlin Byrd reports. \"Part of the blessing for me was not getting married before now,\" Scott told the newspaper. \"My feelings are like a kid in a candy shop.\" ...

Josh Shapiro could potentially hurt Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign if chosen as her running mate.\n\nSingleton appeared on \"State of the Union\" to discuss Harris' running mate shortlist, as the vice president is reportedlyhosting final meetings with candidates. The CNN commentator called out Shapiro as potentially \"the worst\" choice Harris could make due to the effect it could have on her chances of winning Michigan.\n\n\"I want to touch on the Shapiro issue. I think out of all of the possibilities, he would potentially be the worst one if I'm looking at Michigan. You're seeing a resurfacing past -- \" Singleton began.\n\n\"Worse for Democrats or for Republicans?\" CNN host Dana Bash jumped in.\n\nSingleton continued to state how Harris' campaign could be affected by Michigan due to \"large percentage\" of Muslim voters who could abstain from voting the same way they did in February during President Joe Biden's primary.\n\n\"For Democrats and for vice president Harris to win the state of Michigan. Past statements are coming up about things he stated in the past about the Palestinian people. Some of his rulings as governor as it pertains to state workers and their potential advocacy which could thus lead them to being fired has caused quite the conundrum drumming criticism from younger progressives,\" Singleton said.\n\n\"I think there's a large percentage of Muslims in the state of Michigan that would absolutely stay home. I went to look at some of those numbers in 2020 compared to now, the vice president cannot afford to lose a substantial number of them,\" Singleton continued. \"So I would look at someone else if I were Democrats, I don't think that would be the best pick strategically.\"\n\nBash pointed out, however, Shapiro's stance on protests, the Middle East, Israel and the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are \"almost identical\" to other running mate options, with the \"only difference\" being the Democratic governor is Jewish. The CNN host asked Singleton if Harris should \"give in to that,\" to which the political commentator highlighted the \"appearance\" of \"anti-zionism\" within parts of the party.\n\n\"Well, you know where I stand on that issue. I'm as pro-Israel as they come -- you and I have had many conversations about that. But I think that it speaks to a bit of the problem with younger progressive Democrats and the ceasefire. I think likely we will see protests returned again to college campuses. You and I have had those conversations,\" Singleton said. \"I certainly don't think it's a good thing, but it showcases within the Democratic Party, there is at least, and I wouldn't say broadly speaking, but there is the appearance of some level of anti-zionism. I'll put it that way at best, and that's a problem.\"\n\nHarris reportedly held meetings with a half-dozen options over the weekend as she is expected to make the formal announcement of her choice within the upcoming days, according to the Associated Press. In addition to Shapiro, some of Harris' options also include Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the outlet reported.\n\nPush back against the Pennsylvania governor has come forward from other party lawmakers. Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman allegedly has major concerns with Shapiro joining Harris' campaign, as he reportedly believes the governor is focused on his own personal ambitions, three sources told Politico.\n\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman additionally was called out online after endorsing only Waltz and Beshear after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer withdrew her name from consideration, with some users labeling the move as antisemitism.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Here's who's still in the race", "body": "Once decided, her VP pick will join her on a tour of multiple battleground states across the US ahead of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nKamala Harris is only days away from making her first public appearance with her pick for vice-president -- but her campaign says she still has not made a decision on who it will be.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic US presidential nominee is eyeing a number of candidates.\n\nOnce decided, her VP pick will join her on a tour of multiple battleground states across the US ahead of the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nSome have already dropped out of the race, including North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nMs Harris has also met with some of the top contenders for interviews in Washington at the weekend, according to Reuters.\n\nHere's who's still in the running -- and what they bring to the table.\n\nThe 51-year-old Pennsylvania governor has been out campaigning for Ms Harris in the last week, but said he hasn't spoken to her since July 21.\n\nPennsylvania is a key swing state in the election, worth 19 electoral votes.\n\nHe was elected to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives in 2004, going on to be Montgomery County commissioner and Pennsylvania's attorney-general.\n\nHe became the state's 48th governor in 2022, with his campaign focusing on criticising his opponent's anti-abortion stance and controversy surrounding the US Capitol Riot.\n\nAsked whether he was being vetted as a potential VP candidate, he said he would not add \"any political pressure\" on to Ms Harris.\n\n\"She will make this deeply personal decision as to who she wants to run with and who she wants to govern with and move America forward with,\" he said.\n\nThe New Republic's David Klion labelled him \"the one vice-presidential pick who could ruin Democratic unity\".\n\nA letter signed by nearly 50 progressive candidates urged Ms Harris to reconsider him as running mate, according to political news outlet The Hill.\n\nThe letter noted while he was \"a valued member of the Democratic coalition\", he had become known for his \"shortcomings as a national candidate\".\n\nFounding director of progressive non-profit organisation The Institute for Public Accuracy Norman Solomon said picking Mr Shapiro \"could fracture support among the party\", calling the conflict in Gaza \"the most divisive issue\" among Democrats.\n\n\"To unify the party and defeat Trump's MAGA forces, Harris needs to distance herself in a meaningful way from Joe Biden's Gaza policy,\" he said.\n\n\"If she does so, she can win back the votes and energy of young activists, progressives, racial justice organisers, Arab Americans and Muslims -- many of whom devoted weeks or months of their lives in 2020 to defeating Trump on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n\"In early April, after Democratic governors in other states had called for a ceasefire in Gaza, Muslim leaders in Philadelphia criticised Shapiro for his refusal to do so.\n\n\"Beginning in late April, Shapiro and his office repeatedly prodded campuses to 'restore order' and take action against student protest movements.\"\n\nThe Minnesota governor has gained traction in the last few weeks, being widely credited as one of the first to label his conservative opponents \"weird\".\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" the 60-year-old said in one now-viral MSNBC interview.\n\n\"They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room, that's what it comes down to and don't, you know, get sugar-coating this, these are weird ideas.\"\n\nMr Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and member of the Army National Guard. After retiring, he was a member of Congress and elected as governor in 2018.\n\nIn the past, he has referenced his own family's fertility struggles and use of IVF to emphasise reproductive rights, and spoken out against book bans.\n\nUnder his leadership, Minnesota legalised cannabis and expanded background checks for firearms.\n\nBut there are also concerns about his name recognition, geography and past controversies becoming a liability.\n\nRutgers University political science professor Ross Baker told the Minnesota Post: \"The introduction problem is not an insignificant one.\"\n\n\"Voters would ask, 'Who is this guy and why was he chosen?' That's a burden for the campaign,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Politico, Ms Harris's campaign is weighing how well a \"gruff\" Mr Walz would mesh with Ms Harris.\n\nMr Walz has previously come under fire for inadequate oversight of programs in Minnesota, including one that led to the theft of $US250 million ($385 million), one of the largest pandemic fraud cases in the US.\n\nHe was also criticised for his delayed response to protests following the 2020 death of George Floyd. It was claimed Mr Walz waited too long to call in the Minnesota National Guard as violence broke out.\n\nThe Kentucky governor was named as a potential replacement for President Joe Biden last month and has since been tipped as a top contender to be Ms Harris's running mate.\n\nThe 46-year-old was elected as Kentucky's 63rd governor in 2019, having served as the state's attorney-general from 2015.\n\nLike other candidates, he has made several national news appearances taking aim at Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a move which prompted the New York Times to dub him \"the amiable attack dog\".\n\nDuring the pandemic, he gained more of a profile due to his nightly televised press briefings, with Democratic activist and former Kentucky Senate candidate Amy McGrath labelling him \"the great consoler\".\n\n\"He's really compassionate and responsive. And he's an on-the-ground kind of guy,\" she told The Independent.\n\n\"He's got the experience of an executive. He knows how to talk to voters who don't live on the coasts, who don't always agree with [his] party. And I think that is a big benefit to any ticket.\"\n\nBut others have labelled his work as on par with most other governors at the time.\n\nFormer George W Bush aide and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Mr Beshear had simply performed adequately in a time of need.\n\n\"We had a tornado [and] he went around and he hugged people and handed out cases of water,\" he told The Independent.\n\n\"I would expect any governor to do that. I don't think that makes you a brilliant politician. He's a figurehead who hugs people when the weather gets bad. That's effectively what he does. And there's no magic in that.\"\n\nMr Beshear leaned into supporting abortion rights, but critics have pointed to his pick of a \"personally pro-life\" lieutenant-governor.\n\nKentucky is also a deep-red state that Democrats are unlikely to swing even with Mr Beshear on board.\n\nThe 42-year-old former naval officer is currently the US transportation secretary. He dropped out of the 2020 presidential race and endorsed Joe Biden.\n\nWhile, like other candidates, he's remained coy about whether he is being vetted by Ms Harris's campaign, the New York Times reported Mr Buttigieg had organised a Zoom call with about 100 of his past donors about 24 hours after Mr Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the call, he reportedly told donors he was interested in being chosen.\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would be the first openly gay vice-presidential nominee.\n\nAs transportation secretary, he has also been at the forefront of high-profile challenges, including the Ohio train derailment and incidents involving Boeing.\n\nLast week, he was on a campaign tour across the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as his home state of Indiana.\n\nA former staffer of both Ms Harris and Mr Buttigieg, Rachel Palermo, said the two \"have a great rapport\".\n\n\"They recognise each other's talents and strengths,\" she told Politico.\n\n\"I think they both represent the future of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nHowever, like Mr Beshear, he is unlikely to provide an election boost given his background in Republican states Indiana and Michigan.\n\nDemocratic fundraiser Susie Tompkins Bell, who backed Mr Buttigieg in 2020, said it would be \"expecting a lot\".\n\n\"I mean, we've got to go bold,\" she told the New York Times.\n\n\"It's big to have a woman of colour and a gay man. I think that would be ideal. That was my ideal team. But we also have to be realistic.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old Arizona senator stepped in to fill a seat held by Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer in 2018, and was re-elected in both the 2020 special election and the 2022 election.\n\nA former astronaut and US Navy captain, Mr Kelly criticised the Biden administration for its handling of immigration and campaigned in favour of abortion access.\n\nOn Wednesday local time, Mr Kelly told MSNBC he was \"not going to get into any of that\" when asked whether he would join Ms Harris on her campaign tour.\n\n\"I am going to be focused on making sure that Kamala is the next president,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to be travelling across the country tirelessly. Next week, my plan right now is to be in Arizona.\"\n\nBut his focus on passing bipartisan bills has raised some concerns over whether he will be able to fill the typical attack dog role of a presidential running mate.\n\nDemocratic strategist John LaBombard told The Hill: \"The vice-presidential candidate really ideally would be somebody who would be comfortable being an attack dog on the other ticket but doing it in a way that's not off-putting to winnable voters.\"\n\n\"My guess is that Senator Kelly would have some growth to do in that part of the role, at least compared to Governor Walz,\" Mr LaBombard said.\n\nAs the election cycle has intensified, Mr Kelly has made increased appearances on television, something he previously avoided.\n\nPotential vice-presidential running mates face a vetting process before they're chosen and announced.\n\nPrevious vetters, usually campaign officials and lawyers, have said they typically take a month to comb through candidates' backgrounds.\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper opted out of the vetting process, with ABC US reporting he had not submitted the requisite vetting material.\n\nThe Harris campaign was believed to be initially looking at a dozen potential candidates which has rapidly narrowed.\n\nThe woman who led former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's search in 2012, Beth Myers, told Politico their process \"started with a large, out-of-the-box group of names and whittled it down\" over a lengthy period.\n\n\"The [vetting] process she can do truncated, but what [Ms Harris] doesn't have is the luxury of being able to mull over not just the campaign,\" she said.\n\n\"We weren't looking at just a campaign partner. We were looking at a governing partner. A campaign partner might help you in a swing state. A governing partner would help you govern the United States of America.\n\n\"She will have to throw a lot more people on the vetting process than we did. We had a very small team. It was very discreet, very candid.\n\n\"When you have a little more time than Kamala does, you do have an opportunity to craft the narrative right out of the box, of how you want to present this candidate, knowing full well that there's going to be incoming from the opposition candidate and the scrutinising media.\"\n\nSince last week, delegates in the Democratic Party have been able to vote virtually to select their new nominee -- that means the almost 4,000 pledged delegates are voting to approve Ms Harris as the party's nominee.\n\nShe is the only candidate in the running and has already received the majority of votes needed.\n\nIt is not known whether the roll call will be live-streamed, but the full count will be shared after all voting is complete.\n\nThe voting window will close at 6pm, August 5 local time (8am, August 8 AEST).\n\nWhile she has to choose her running mate by August 7 US time -- to meet Ohio's ballot deadline -- her vice-presidential pick does not have to be nominated at the same time.\n\nThe VP candidate will not be voted on.\n\nAt the in-person convention held in Chicago later this month, delegates will hold a ceremonial vote, but the ticket will already be confirmed.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type":

Her impending decision is merely a subject of excited speculation; delegates there appeared to be along for the ride, regardless.\n\nFrom USA Today: Who's up? Who's down? Harris' VP options in limbo ahead of imminent decision\n\n\"There's not one person on her list I wouldn't like,\" said Vanderburgh County party chair Cheryl Schultz, who will be voting on Harris' pick as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention later this month.\n\nButtigieg is on the vice-president-hopeful shortlist, as is Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. Schultz believes Buttigieg has the best shot, because of his existing relationship with Harris as transportation secretary, and because he's proven adept at defending the party line on various platforms, including conservative outlets like Fox News. Buttigieg held a fundraiser for Harris Saturday in New Hampshire; Beshear and Walz also have fundraisers scheduled Monday.\n\nHarris is expected to make her decision by Tuesday.\n\nBut other Hoosier DNC delegates and party insiders say that Buttigieg, much as they would love to see him prevail, may not be the most strategic choice for the ticket.\n\n\"My heart wants Pete,\" said Veronica Pejril, a delegate from Putnam County. \"My brain tells me it's probably going to be Shapiro.\"\n\nThey say this due to the electoral math: Shapiro, from a swing state like Pennsylvania, would deliver votes that 8 Congressional District party chair Dave Crooks compares to \"gold at Fort Knox.\" It nearly pains Crooks to admit it -- he's such a Buttigieg fan that he was one of about 10,000 Hoosiers who still voted for him for president in 2020, even though Buttigieg had dropped out of the race.\n\nIt might help, too, to choose someone not so closely affiliated with the Biden administration -- an outsider, said Vigo County Democratic Chair Joseph Etling said.\n\nDerek Camp, a delegate and the Allen County party chair, said he thinks Buttigieg and Waltz each have a good chance -- Waltz, because of his folksy disposition.\n\n\"He's your favorite Midwest grandpa who's just fun to hang out with,\" Camp said.\n\nOf greater import to convention attendees is the shot in the arm Harris' campaign has injected down-ballot. In the week after her campaign launch, Camp said he fielded calls from about 30 precinct directors in his district asking for door-knocking lists. Among the statehouse races that the Indiana House Democratic Caucus tracks, field director Seth Rawlings said there was a roughly 30% increase in the amount of doors they knocked on and an average 20% increase in donations to their candidates.\n\nRawlings, a 23-year-old Muncie resident, signed up to be a delegate the day of President Joe Biden's infamously poor debate performance that changed the tune among Democrats. Tensions were high when it was unclear whether Democrats might have a contested convention.\n\n\"When I first signed up for this, I thought we were marching toward battle,\" Rawlings said. \"Now it feels like it's going to be more of a party.\"\n\nThe mood Saturday, especially at a dinner event where former Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan gave a keynote address, was ebullient -- far more spirited than the defeatist mood many Indiana Democrats have grown used to in a state where they've been out of power at the Statehouse for more than a decade.\n\nRyan spent some of his time revving up the audience over a different vice-presidential pick: JD Vance, Republican nominee Donald Trump's running mate and the Ohio Senator who won the seat over Ryan in 2022. He decried Vance's support for a national abortion ban, and said Trump's selection of him is a doubling down on Project 2025, a playbook of conservative policies that the Heritage Foundation crafted in the event Trump is elected.\n\n\"We're not going to allow them to hijack the political debate in this country,\" Ryan said. \"It's time to move on. It's time to heal.\"\n\nIn an interview with IndyStar afterward, Ryan said he didn't have strong feelings about who Harris should pick to run by her side.\n\n\"I almost don't even care,\" he said. \"It's like, just pick and let's go.\"\n\nThat's not far from the sentiment among Indiana party loyalists, like Schultz of Vanderburgh County.\n\n\"We're just going to be happy with whatever,\" she said. \"I think there are no bad choices.\"\n\n\"There'll be cheering all around,\" Pejril added.\n\nContact IndyStar state government and politics reporter Kayla Dwyer at kdwyer@indystar.com or follow her on Twitter @kayla_dwyer17.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Indystar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indianapolis_star@indystar.com", "name": "Indianapolis Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Here's who's still in the running", "body": "The 51-year-old Pennsylvania governor has been out campaigning for Ms Harris in the last week, but said he hasn't spoken to her since July 21.\n\nPennsylvania is a key swing state in the election, worth 19 electoral votes.\n\nHe was elected to Pennsylvania's House of Representatives in 2004, going on to be Montgomery County commissioner and Pennsylvania's attorney-general.\n\nHe became the state's 48th governor in 2022, with his campaign focusing on criticising his opponent's anti-abortion stance and controversy surrounding the US Capitol Riot.\n\nAsked whether he was being vetted as a potential VP candidate, he said he would not add \"any political pressure\" on to Ms Harris.\n\nThe New Republic's David Klion labelled him \"the one vice-presidential pick who could ruin Democratic unity\".\n\nA letter signed by nearly 50 progressive candidates urged Ms Harris to reconsider him as running mate, according to political news outlet The Hill.\n\nThe letter noted while he was \"a valued member of the Democratic coalition\", he had become known for his \"shortcomings as a national candidate\".\n\nFounding director of progressive non-profit organisation The Institute for Public Accuracy Norman Solomon said picking Mr Shapiro \"could fracture support among the party\", calling the conflict in Gaza \"the most divisive issue\" among Democrats.\n\n\"If she does so, she can win back the votes and energy of young activists, progressives, racial justice organisers, Arab Americans and Muslims -- many of whom devoted weeks or months of their lives in 2020 to defeating Trump on behalf of the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n\"In early April, after Democratic governors in other states had called for a ceasefire in Gaza, Muslim leaders in Philadelphia criticised Shapiro for his refusal to do so.\n\n\"Beginning in late April, Shapiro and his office repeatedly prodded campuses to 'restore order' and take action against student protest movements.\"\n\nTim Walz\n\nThe Minnesota governor has gained traction in the last few weeks, being widely credited as one of the first to label his conservative opponents \"weird\".\n\n\"These are weird people on the other side,\" the 60-year-old said in one now-viral MSNBC interview.\n\nMr Walz was a high school teacher, football coach and member of the Army National Guard. After retiring, he was a member of Congress and elected as governor in 2018.\n\nIn the past, he has referenced his own family's fertility struggles and use of IVF to emphasise reproductive rights, and spoken out against book bans.\n\nUnder his leadership, Minnesota legalised cannabis and expanded background checks for firearms.\n\nBut there are also concerns about his name recognition, geography and past controversies becoming a liability.\n\nRutgers University political science professor Ross Baker told the Minnesota Post: \"The introduction problem is not an insignificant one.\"\n\nAccording to Politico, Ms Harris's campaign is weighing how well a \"gruff\" Mr Walz would mesh with Ms Harris.\n\nMr Walz has previously come under fire for inadequate oversight of programs in Minnesota, including one that led to the theft of $US250 million ($385 million), one of the largest pandemic fraud cases in the US.\n\nHe was also criticised for his delayed response to protests following the 2020 death of George Floyd. It was claimed Mr Walz waited too long to call in the Minnesota National Guard as violence broke out.\n\nAndy Beshear\n\nThe Kentucky governor was named as a potential replacement for President Joe Biden last month and has since been tipped as a top contender to be Ms Harris's running mate.\n\nThe 46-year-old was elected as Kentucky's 63rd governor in 2019, having served as the state's attorney-general from 2015.\n\nLike other candidates, he has made several national news appearances taking aim at Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, a move which prompted the New York Times to dub him \"the amiable attack dog\".\n\nDuring the pandemic, he gained more of a profile due to his nightly televised press briefings, with Democratic activist and former Kentucky Senate candidate Amy McGrath labelling him \"the great consoler\".\n\n\"He's really compassionate and responsive. And he's an on-the-ground kind of guy,\" she told The Independent.\n\nBut others have labelled his work as on par with most other governors at the time.\n\nFormer George W Bush aide and Republican consultant Scott Jennings said Mr Beshear had simply performed adequately in a time of need.\n\n\"We had a tornado [and] he went around and he hugged people and handed out cases of water,\" he told The Independent.\n\n\"I would expect any governor to do that. I don't think that makes you a brilliant politician. He's a figurehead who hugs people when the weather gets bad. That's effectively what he does. And there's no magic in that.\"\n\nMr Beshear leaned into supporting abortion rights, but critics have pointed to his pick of a \"personally pro-life\" lieutenant-governor.\n\nKentucky is also a deep-red state that Democrats are unlikely to swing even with Mr Beshear on board.\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nThe 42-year-old former naval officer is currently the US transportation secretary. He dropped out of the 2020 presidential race and endorsed Joe Biden.\n\nWhile, like other candidates, he's remained coy about whether he is being vetted by Ms Harris's campaign, the New York Times reported Mr Buttigieg had organised a Zoom call with about 100 of his past donors about 24 hours after Mr Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nIn the call, he reportedly told donors he was interested in being chosen.\n\nThe former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would be the first openly gay vice-presidential nominee.\n\nAs transportation secretary, he has also been at the forefront of high-profile challenges, including the Ohio train derailment and incidents involving Boeing.\n\nLast week, he was on a campaign tour across the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as his home state of Indiana.\n\nA former staffer of both Ms Harris and Mr Buttigieg, Rachel Palermo, said the two \"have a great rapport\".\n\n\"They recognise each other's talents and strengths,\" she told Politico.\n\n\"I think they both represent the future of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nHowever, like Mr Beshear, he is unlikely to provide an election boost given his background in Republican states Indiana and Michigan.\n\nDemocratic fundraiser Susie Tompkins Bell, who backed Mr Buttigieg in 2020, said it would be \"expecting a lot\".\n\n\"I mean, we've got to go bold,\" she told the New York Times.\n\nMark Kelly\n\nThe 60-year-old Arizona senator stepped in to fill a seat held by Senator John McCain, who died of brain cancer in 2018, and was re-elected in both the 2020 special election and the 2022 election.\n\nA former astronaut and US Navy captain, Mr Kelly criticised the Biden administration for its handling of immigration and campaigned in favour of abortion access.\n\nOn Wednesday local time, Mr Kelly told MSNBC he was \"not going to get into any of that\" when asked whether he would join Ms Harris on her campaign tour.\n\n\"I am going to be focused on making sure that Kamala is the next president,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to be travelling across the country tirelessly. Next week, my plan right now is to be in Arizona.\"\n\nBut his focus on passing bipartisan bills has raised some concerns over whether he will be able to fill the typical attack dog role of a presidential running mate.\n\nDemocratic strategist John LaBombard told The Hill: \"The vice-presidential candidate really ideally would be somebody who would be comfortable being an attack dog on the other ticket but doing it in a way that's not off-putting to winnable voters.\"\n\n\"My guess is that Senator Kelly would have some growth to do in that part of the role, at least compared to Governor Walz,\" Mr LaBombard said.\n\nAs the election cycle has intensified, Mr Kelly has made increased appearances on television, something he previously avoided.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au",

The conversation touched on various topics such as whom Harris should pick, whom she will pick, the Electoral College landscape for both Harris and Donald Trump, as well as any surprises or concerns they have about Harris, the Democrats, Trump, and JD Vance.\n\nDuring the discussion, Michelle Goldberg expressed her support for Tim Walz or Andy Beshear as potential running mates for Harris. She highlighted Walz's ability to articulate progressive priorities in a plain-spoken manner and praised his branding of Republicans as \"weird.\" Ross Douthat acknowledged the appeal of Walz to Democrats but questioned whether selecting a heartland white guy would significantly benefit the Democratic Party. Jamelle Bouie added that historical data suggests that the impact of a vice-presidential selection on state-by-state vote share is minimal, with the last nominee to potentially deliver a state being Lyndon Johnson in 1960.\n\nWhile the panelists discussed potential running mate options for Harris, it is important to note that the vice-presidential selection process is a crucial decision for any presidential candidate. The choice of a running mate can influence public perception, showcase a candidate's values, and appeal to different demographics within the electorate. Additionally, a running mate can bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the ticket, complementing the presidential candidate's strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn the current political landscape, Vice President Kamala Harris faces the task of selecting a running mate who can not only energize the Democratic base but also appeal to swing voters and undecided individuals. The choice of a running mate will play a significant role in shaping the narrative of the Democratic campaign and defining the key issues that will drive voter turnout in the upcoming election.\n\nAs the discussion on Harris's running mate options continues, it is essential to consider the broader implications of this decision on the electoral prospects of the Democratic Party. The selection of a running mate is a strategic move that can either bolster or hinder a presidential candidate's chances of success in a competitive electoral environment. By carefully weighing the pros and cons of each potential running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris can position herself for a strong and effective campaign that resonates with voters across the political spectrum.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Goldberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Goldberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamelle_Bouie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamelle Bouie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Douthat", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ross Douthat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

It's a tough enough task on a normal timeline; it's even harder on an abbreviated vetting schedule with just 92 days till the election.\n\nHere is what we know about the choreography: On Saturday, the vetting team led by former AG ERIC HOLDER briefed Harris, going as deep as they were able on the roughly half-dozen final candidates.\n\nYesterday, Harris held final interviews (or what were expected to be final interviews) with the top-tier candidates. Arizona Sen. MARK KELLY, Pennsylvania Gov. JOSH SHAPIRO and Minnesota Gov. TIM WALZ interviewed with Harris at the VP's residence, though a person familiar with the process told us that others might well have spoken virtually to Harris, as well.\n\nThose interviews will be crucial, we're told. It's a chance for would-be running mates to clear up vetting issues and test how simpatico their views of the upcoming campaign might be.\n\nBut it's also about chemistry: Can these two work closely for the next four to eight years? Do they like each other enough to tie their political fates together?\n\nThat means today is decision day. Harris is scheduled to appear with her pick tomorrow in Philadelphia, so she essentially has the next 24 hours to think over her decision -- and think over it some more -- and then make a final call (and phone call).\n\nThe precise nature of the rollout is not final, but campaign insiders are pointing to JOE BIDEN's 2020 video introduction of Harris as a likely model, though a media leak of the pick could upend those plans.\n\nThe hope and expectation in Harris world is that the announcement, and the subsequent seven-state brainstorming tour, generates the kind of excitement that will blot out much of the reporting in recent days on the sharp-elbowed jockeying taking place outside the confines of the Naval Observatory.\n\n\"The final stage of the campaign to be [Harris's] running mate reached something of an ugly phase in recent days,\" as NYT's Reid Epstein, Theodore Schleifer and Nick Corasaniti put it, \"as donors, interest groups and political rivals from the party's moderate and progressive wings lobbied for their preferred candidates and passed around memos debating the contenders' political weaknesses with key demographics.\"\n\nThat chattering-class conversation goes something like this (apologies to Kentucky Gov. ANDY BESHEAR, Transportation Secretary PETE BUTTIGIEG and Illinois Gov. JB PRITZKER):\n\n-- KELLY: On paper, he's almost irresistible. He's an astronaut who has spent 54 days in space. He flew combat missions in Desert Storm. He has hands-on experience with immigration as a border-state senator. And he spent years working with wife GABBY GIFFORDS campaigning against gun violence -- a core Democratic issue.\n\nBut Kelly isn't known as a dynamic personality. Multiple Democrats we spoke to (including those pulling for him) say it's hard to see on the stump by himself pumping up a rally of thousands. And he's facing lingering skepticism from Big Labor, who have taken note of his late conversion on their top legislative priority, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.\n\n-- SHAPIRO: No pick on the board has more upside. Setting aside that Harris is planning to introduce her running mate in Shapiro's hometown, he's the popular governor of the state that is almost literally the whole ballgame -- no Pennsylvania, no 270. He's charming, quick on his feet and great on the stump.\n\nHe's also the contender who has gotten the most oppo dumped on him over the past two weeks. From his college-age views on a two-state solution to criticism about how he spoke about campus protesters to questions about his own towering ambitions, progressives have found plenty to jawbone about. And then there's this, which we heard from a Democrat this weekend: \"If you think statewide popularity in your home state translates nationally, talk to RON DeSANTIS.\"\n\n-- WALZ: He's only six months older than Harris but gives big Midwestern dad (granddad?) vibes. Progressives love his background: He served as both football coach and faculty advisor for the Gay-Straight Alliance during his two-decade high school teaching career. He was an officer in the Army National Guard, got elected to the House in 2006, survived the Tea Party wipeout four years later and is in his second term as governor.\n\nAs governor, he's benefited from a Democratic trifecta that allowed him to deliver a host of progressive wins. But that's also his biggest demerit: In terms of balancing the ticket, he doesn't do much as a blue-stater. Best to view Walz as the no-drama pick.\n\nWHAT THE GOP IS THINKING: We've watched DONALD TRUMP and fellow Republicans struggle over the past two weeks to find a message that doesn't focus on Harris's race and ethnicity. But her running-mate pick -- the most obvious test Americans will see of her decision-making capabilities -- gives them another chance to get it together.\n\n\"Our hearts go out to whomever Kamala Harris chooses as her running mate, as they will be asked every day for the next 95 days how they could possibly stand by the most weak, failed, and dangerously liberal candidate in history,\" KAROLINE LEAVITT, Trump's national press secretary, told us.\n\nIt will be JD VANCE on the front lines delivering those attacks this week, Alex Isenstadt reports this morning. The Ohio senator, he reports, will be \"bracketing\" the Democratic ticket this week -- appearing at campaign events in four cities the mystery pair is set to visit, starting with Philadelphia tomorrow.\n\nMAGA Inc., the pro-Trump Super PAC, telegraphed some of the individual attacks in an email blast yesterday: Shapiro \"wants boys in girls' sports,\" Walz \"did nothing while Minneapolis burned,\" Kelly \"supports Kamala's America Last agenda with his embrace of China,\" and so forth.\n\nWe called up a veteran Republican strategist for a more candid take. This operative, who worked in recent Arizona Senate elections, told us the GOP should be \"terrified\" of Kelly but also spoke highly of Shapiro as \"the most difficult one to define.\"\n\nWalz, on the other hand, \"doesn't add anything to the ticket. He's not the future of the party like Shapiro or Buttigieg, not from an important state electorally, doesn't print money or offer a great voice to one of the top issues on the ballot like Mark Kelly.\n\n\"He's got charming dad vibes, but if charming dad vibes helped elect presidents, TIM KAINE would be enjoying his last few months living in the Naval Observatory.\"\n\nGood Monday morning. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.\n\nMEDIAWATCH -- A heated labor dispute at one of the country's most prominent progressive media companies will come to a head today with the vast majority of Crooked Media employees set to walk off the job today in protest of protracted contract negotiations.\n\nThe company behind \"Pod Save America\" and founded by prominent Obama administration alumni has been in talks with workers for more than a year, and bargaining unit member LUKE OBERHOLTZER told us the walkout is \"a necessary step to encourage management to move towards us in these final weeks.\"\n\nA Crooked Media spokesperson said that \"we don't think walking out in the middle of negotiations makes a lot of sense and are eager to get back to the table so we can reach a deal this coming Wednesday and Thursday.\"\n\nManagement's latest offer, the spokesperson said, included minimum salaries of $78,412; fully-paid-for health, dental and vision benefits; 18 weeks of parental leave and minimum severance of 12 weeks, among other items.\n\nBut Oberholtzer said workers are seeking concessions on \"several issues key to the unit including layoff protections, minimum salaries, annual raises, and the use of AI in unit work.\" (The minimum salary the company has offered, he noted, is \"nuanced and includes an end-of-year bonus wrapped into base salary.\")\n\nTHE WEEK -- Tomorrow: Harris holds a campaign rally in Philadelphia with her running mate.

KENNEDY JR. Streisand-effected himself yesterday by trying to get out ahead of a crazy anecdote The New Yorker's Clare Malone relays in a big profile today. The story goes, as recounted by Kennedy (to ROSEANNE BARR) and Malone: In 2014, he was out falconing in New York when he came upon a dead black bear cub. He put the carcass in his car, posing for a picture with his hand in its mouth (\"Maybe that's where I got my brain worm\"), and wanted to bring it home to skin. But Kennedy ended up having to rush to Peter Luger Steak House and then to the airport, so he ended up just dropping it in Central Park with a bike.\n\nThe bear's discovery made headlines at the time -- unbelievably, and apparently in a coincidence, in a NYT article written by Kennedy's relative TATIANA SCHLOSSBERG -- but the culprit wasn't identified until now. Kennedy said he hoped his Central Park plant might throw the city off his trail because of recent bike accidents, per Jessica Piper. Meanwhile, Kennedy's third-party presidential campaign, which once looked like a real threat to peel off votes from Democrats and Republicans, continues to stumble downward in the polls.\n\nMore top reads:\n\nJUDGE FOR YOURSELF -- Senate Democrats have now confirmed 205 of Biden's federal judge nominees, the exact same pace that Senate Republicans had under Trump, Axios' Stephen Neukam reports. And Dems want to match the GOP tally by the end of the year, too: The magic number is 234.\n\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD\n\nMIDDLE EAST LATEST -- With the region on edge over fears of an even larger war, Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN said yesterday that Iran's and Hezbollah's retaliation against Israel could commence as soon as today or tomorrow, Axios' Barak Ravid reports. Blinken's warning was conveyed to G7 foreign ministers in a conference call, as the U.S. and other Western countries hope that exerting diplomatic pressure might prevent Iran and its allies (and then Israel) from making the situation spiral out of control. And Blinken said the U.S. doesn't have a clear sense of what attacks Iran or Hezbollah might make.\n\nAs for a cease-fire/hostage release deal in the Israel-Hamas war, a frustrated Blinken told his G7 counterparts that they'd gotten close before Israel's recent major assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, political fallout over the war could come to a head again later this month at the Democratic National Convention, where pro-Palestinian protesters are expected to number in the tens of thousands, the L.A. Times' Jeffrey Fleishman reports from Chicago. HATEM ABUDAYYEH, one of the march's organizers, says the switch from Biden to Harris hasn't dimmed their momentum. On the flip side, Arab Americans for Trump leader BISHARA BAHBAH tells The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner that Trump has \"indicated privately\" he supports a two-state solution -- which is contrary to Trump's public comments earlier this year.\n\nVALLEY TALK\n\nWHAT ELON MUSK'S INTERNET LOOKS LIKE -- \"Secretaries of state urge Musk to fix AI chatbot spreading false election info,\" by WaPo's Sarah Ellison and Amy Gardner: \"Grok, the AI search assistant on Musk's X platform, suggested that Kamala Harris had missed the ballot deadline in nine states.

A person with direct knowledge of the PAC's operations told CNBC that, at one point since the group registered with the Federal Election Commission in May, the links on the website were functioning properly -- but admits now they're not.\"\n\nPOLICY CORNER\n\nSCOTUS FALLOUT -- When the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority ended Chevron deference in their Loper Bright decision, the SEC looked to be a top target for litigation -- and indeed the first major challenges to the Wall Street cop are now underway, Declan Harty reports this morning. Their initial target is a huge SEC stock market monitoring system, which aims to use surveillance to identify and root out potential abuses.\n\nConservative criticisms of the system run from the gamut from privacy and data security concerns to the constitutionality of its setup to pay-fors for the $1 billion program. Multiple lawsuits are already underway -- \"one of the first signs of how opponents of the so-called administrative state plan to invoke the Chevron ruling against federal agencies.\" An uncertain Washington has been scrambling to grapple with the fallout of the decision, though SEC Chair GARY GENSLER publicly is staying calm.\n\nMore top reads:\n\nMEDIAWATCH\n\nYOWZA -- \"Journal still can't confirm January story about UN agency for Palestinians,\" by Semafor's Max Tani: \"That one of the [WSJ's] biggest and most impactful stories about the war was based on information it could not verify is a startling acknowledgement, and calls into question the validity of the claims as reported in the Journal.\"\n\nMORE POLITICS\n\nCLIP AND SAVE -- \"What to watch in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington primaries,\" by the Washington Examiner's Rachel Schilke\n\nMEDIA MOVES -- NOTUS is adding Lissandra Villa de Petrzelka as an editor and Lillian Bautista as its first audience editor.

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain criticized Kelly for not fully addressing the union's concerns about his stance on pro-labor legislation and expressed even greater reservations about Shapiro's support for school vouchers.\n\nWhile major Democratic donors have generally expressed comfort with any of the candidates on Harris' shortlist, divisions have emerged within the party's largest donor networks.\n\nIn particular, left-wing donors in the Democracy Alliance have raised concerns about Shapiro, while progressive activists in the Gamechanger Salon group have circulated criticisms of his positions, especially on the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nThe debate has grown particularly heated, with some members of the group using language deemed antisemitic by others, leading to a re with accusations flying and tensions rising.\n\nThere has been a concerted push among some progressive donors to support Tim Walz, who has become a favorite among the party's most liberal contributors.\n\nSenator Fetterman, who has a history of clashes with Shapiro, has reportedly expressed his displeasure at the prospect of the governor being elevated to a national ticket.\n\nOne of his advisers even reached out to Harris' campaign to voice objections to Shapiro's potential selection.\n\nAmid growing attacks on Shapiro, some moderates within the party have come to his defense. Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" condemned the recent criticism of Shapiro as a \"toxic mix of antisemitism, extremist views on Gaza, and jealous colleagues.\"\n\nREAD ALSO: Donald Trump opens up on assassination's attempt\n\nMeanwhile, a group of progressive donors has been actively pushing for Walz, circulating a memo titled \"The Case for Tim Walz for Vice President\" in an effort to sway Harris.\n\nA similar document supporting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who recently headlined a Harris fundraiser in New Hampshire, has also been making the rounds among key Democrats.\n\nOn Sunday, Kelly posted, then quickly deleted, a social media message suggesting a renewed focus on his work in Arizona. His spokesperson later clarified that the post was removed due to misinterpretation.\n\nShapiro's candidacy has received backing from pro-Israel donors, supporters of school choice, and business-friendly contributors, though these same positions have made him less popular among the party's more liberal funders.\n\nAn apparent compromise candidate could emerge in Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, who has garnered support from both liberal and centrist donors.\n\nAlthough Beshear did not participate in Harris' final interviews on Sunday, he has been actively courting donors, including at an invite-only session on Friday evening.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to Harris' final decision, Walz and Beshear are set to appear at separate fundraisers on Monday evening. While Walz's event in Minneapolis is already sold out, tickets remain available for Beshear's Chicago fundraiser.\n\nBy the time these events take place, the Democratic Party is likely to have its final ticket for 2024.", "source": {"uri": "nationaldailyng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Daily NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olusegun_odunewu@nationaldailyng.com", "name": "Olusegun Odunewu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Auto Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

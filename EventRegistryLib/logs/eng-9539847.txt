Regional Animal Services of King County wrote on its website that local residents and animal control officers corralled the zebra named \"Shug\" in the community of Riverbend, about 30 miles east of Seattle. Officials say the mare seems to be in good condition despite her unusual adventure. The animal services agency says Shug will now be transported to a petting zoo in southwestern Montana. That's where she was originally headed before the escape.\n\nAngel Reese, Cardoso debuts watched widely on fan's livestream after WNBA is unable to broadcast\n\nThe WNBA debuts of Angel Reese and Kamilla Cardoso were widely watched on a social media livestream from a fan who stepped in when the league's app couldn't broadcast the game. Reese and Cardoso played in their first preseason game for the Chicago Sky on Friday night in a 92-81 loss to the Minnesota Lynx. The WNBA's app had incorrectly listed the game as available to watch, leading to confusion from fans before the league clarified that only Caitlin Clark's debut with the Indiana Fever was being broadcast. That's when X user heyheyitsalli stepped in.

Indeed, the question of what happened to the gentleman who thought it wise to hide a bag of snakes in his pants while trying to board a flight is one of genuine human interest at the moment.\n\nJust under a week ago, a TSA spokesperson representing Florida took to Twitter / X to call attention to the idiosyncratic discovery in the man's trousers, reassuring all the snake rights activists in the room that the legless critters were safely turned over to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n\nSo, we know the snakes are alright, but what of their would-be kidnapper?\n\nAt the time of writing, there doesn't appear to be any information regarding the fate of the as-yet-unnamed man following the removal of the snakes from his pants. It's also unclear what his motive was for trying to pull a stunt like this.\n\nThat said, one confident reply to the tweet claims that the breed of the snakes are juvenile Palmetto Corn snakes, which pose effectively no threat to humans whatsoever. That is, they can't physically harm humans, but they can potentially do a bit of financial/social damage if they're found in your pants as evidence of trafficking intent. Indeed, these snakes fetch between $400 and $500 as pets, so it's no great leap of the imagination to think that he was trying to sell them; exactly how much trouble that landed him in, if any, is a mystery we may never solve.\n\nYou thought there was going to be a Samuel L.

At least 74 people were injured and another 67 were missing from the catastrophic flooding, it said. The toll did not include two people who died in an explosion at a flooded gas station in Porto Alegre, where rescue crews were attempting to refuel. The Guaiba River, which flows through the city, is at a historic high of 5.04m, well above the 4.76m that had stood as a record since devastating 1941 floods.\n\nThree bodies recovered from a cliff-top shaft in the crime-hit Baja California are likely those of two Australian brothers and an American who disappeared on a surfing trip, local investigators said on Saturday. Although the bodies were in an \"advanced state of decomposition\" when they were hoisted out of a shaft a few steps from the edge of the Pacific Ocean cliff, authorities believe they were the bodies of the missing men based on certain physical descriptions, state Attorney General Maria Elena Andrade said. Another body found at the site had been there longer and was unconnected to the latest disappearances, officials said. Andrade said one line of inquiry is whether the deaths resulted from an attempt to steal the tourists' pickup truck. The vehicle, which had been burned, was found nearby.\n\nAn Afghan diplomat in India, who was appointed before the Taliban seized power in 2021 and said she was the only woman in the country's diplomatic service, has resigned after reports emerged that she had been detained for allegedly smuggling gold. Zakia Wardak, the Afghan consul-general for Mumbai, on Saturday announced her resignation on X after Indian media reported that she was briefly detained at the city's airport on allegations of smuggling 25 1kg bricks of gold from Dubai. Wardak made no mention of her reported detention or gold smuggling allegations, but wrote that over the past year she and her family had faced numerous personal attacks that \"severely impacted my ability to effectively operate in my role and have demonstrated the challenges faced by women in Afghan society.\"\n\nThe army faced more questions over security lapses after the Zeit Online news site on Saturday reported that thousands of its meetings were freely accessible online. Federal prosecutors are already investigating a secret army conversation on the Ukraine war that was wiretapped and ended up on Russian social media in March. The latest security flaw again concerned the online video-conference tool Webex. Zeit Online said it had been able to access army meetings by using simple search terms on the platform. \"More than 6,000 meetings could be found online,\" some of which were meant to be classified, it wrote.\n\nAirport security officers in Miami found a slithering surprise late last month -- a bag of snakes hidden in a passenger's pants.

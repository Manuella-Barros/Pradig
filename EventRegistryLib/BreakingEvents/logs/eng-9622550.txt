Baby Elsa was believed to be less than an hour old when she was found abandoned in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in East Ham on January 18 this year.\n\nHer sister, Baby Roman, was found in similar circumstances in a play area off Roman Road, Newham, in early February 2019, as freezing temperatures and snow gripped the capital. In September 2017, Baby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket in Balaam Street, Plaistow.\n\nHarry and Roman - not their real names - have since been adopted. But barrister Kate Claxton, representing Newham London Borough Council, previously told the court that the ongoing investigation means that Elsa's birth cannot be registered, meaning no final decision regarding her care can be made.\n\nA further hearing in her case is expected to be held at a later date. Detective Sergeant Laurence Dight, from the Metropolitan Police, told the court on Monday that the police investigation into the identity of the parents remained ongoing, with anyone with information as to the parents' identities asked to contact the force using the reference CAD 6876/18 Jan.\n\nBaby Elsa\n\nBaby Elsa was found in freezing temperatures in East Ham on the night of January 18 this year.\n\nIt is believed she was less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker, wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nShe was discovered at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, and was named Elsa by hospital staff who cared for her, in reference to the freezing temperatures in which she was found and the character from the film Frozen.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \"highly likely\" that Elsa was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nThe woman who left Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on the night of January 18, around half an hour before she was found.\n\nAppealing for her mother to come forward in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, urged anyone with information to urgently get in touch.\n\nThe BBC reported that a previous court hearing was told it took doctors three hours to record Elsa's temperature due to the cold, with the Met Office confirming temperatures dropped as low as minus 4C on the night.\n\nA court-appointed guardian asked the court at the earlier hearing to change the name picked by hospital staff, but Judge Atkinson refused the request as it gave the child something to \"hang on to\".\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April that due to ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nBaby Roman\n\nBaby Roman was also found in freezing temperatures just under five years earlier.\n\nPolice were called to a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham at around 10.15pm on January 30 2019.\n\nThe force said at the time that the baby was found wrapped in a white towel which was put in a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playpark. No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nShe was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nRoman - not her real name - has since been adopted.\n\nBaby Harry\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017.\n\nThe boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Road in Plaistow, east London.\n\nHarry - not his real name - was cared for at a hospital before being discharged and has since been adopted.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Neil Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency":

No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nShe was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017.\n\nThe boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Road in Plaistow, east London.\n\nHarry - not his real name - was cared for at a hospital before being discharged and has since been adopted.\n\nFollowing an application by the PA news agency and the BBC, Judge Carol Atkinson said on Monday at East London Family Court that it could be published that the child, known as Baby Elsa, has a brother and a sister who were discovered in 2017 and 2019 respectively.\n\nIt comes following efforts to increase transparency in the family court system.\n\nPreviously, reporters have had access to courts dealing with sensitive matters involving children, despite them being closed to the public.\n\nHowever, reporting has been highly restricted to only what a judge will allow, to protect the identities of those involved.\n\nUnder a new transparency pilot scheme, introduced last year, accredited journalists and legal bloggers could access three family courts - Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle - to report on cases more freely.\n\nThis was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases to 16 courts across England and Wales as they happen, as they would do in the criminal courts.\n\nThis includes East London Family Court, as well as Manchester, Nottingham, the Central Family Court in London and others.\n\nWhile the identities of the families and certain professionals involved remain protected, judges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFamilies can also talk to a journalist about their case, without risking punishment for contempt of court.\n\nHowever, judges can still decide that some cases may not be reported on or that reporting should be postponed in certain circumstances.\n\nIn Baby Elsa's case, the PA news agency and the BBC applied for the court to vary the terms of the Transparency Order to allow reporting that she has two siblings and other details.\n\nJudge Atkinson ruled on Monday that reporting the information was in the public interest.\n\nShe said: \"There is a clear public interest in reporting this story.\n\n\"The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\n\n\"It is, for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me.\n\n\"If I restrict these rights and the reporting of that story, I think that does impact on public consciousness of these sorts of matters.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThree newborn babies dumped in parks in east London over the past seven years share the same parents, it has been revealed - as the Met Police continue the search for them.\n\nDNA tests presented at a hearing at East London Family Court proved that a baby girl found by a dog walker in Newham earlier this year is the sister of two babies, a boy and a girl, found in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019.\n\nThe baby, named Baby Elsa by hospital staff, was less than an hour old when she was found in a shopping bag in sub-zero temperatures on 18 January.\n\nHer brother, Baby Harry, was found abandoned in a park in Plaistow in 2017, and her sister, Baby Roman, was discovered in a park in Newham in 2019.\n\nAt the family court hearing this month, Judge Carol Atkinson said the story was of \"great public interest\" as she amended restrictions to allow the reporting of the relationship between the children.\n\nThe Met Police have not yet been able to identify the parents, despite a number of public appeals over the children, who have all survived with the eldest two now adopted and Baby Elsa still in foster care.\n\nJudge Atkinson said she hoped that by identifying the children's relationship, it could help the police in its investigation to find the biological parents.\n\nBaby Elsa was found wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag by a dog walker at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in East Ham.\n\nAt the time, police said the baby, who was discovered so cold it took doctors three hours to record her temperature, was likely to have been born in a concealed pregnancy.\n\nBaby Roman was also discovered in freezing temperatures, in a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham, on 30 January in 2019, at 10.15pm.\n\nHe was wrapped in a white towel placed in a shopping bag positioned next to a bench in a children's play area.\n\nLike Baby Elsa, she was also found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC she had been \"shocked and distressed\" to make the find.\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket in a park area off Balaam Street in Plaistow on 17 September in 2017, at 8.20am.\n\nAt the point of each discovery, the Met Police as run appeals asking for information on the parents of the babies, and appealing for people seen in the areas to come forward.\n\nSpeaking after Elsa was found Chief Superintendent Simon Crick said: \"We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.\n\n\"Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby's mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances, please do seek help.\"\n\nIn her ruling to lift reporting restrictions on Monday, Judge Carol Atkinson said: \"The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\"\n\nShe continued: \"It is for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me.\n\n\"If I restrict these rights and the reporting of that story, I think that does impact on public consciousness of these sorts of matters. It restricts the openness of justice.\"\n\nIt comes following efforts to increase transparency in the family court system.\n\nWhile journalists can usually attend family court proceedings, reporting restrictions limit what can be published to protect the anonymity of those involved.\n\nFollowing an application made, Judge Atkinson varied the Transparency Order in Elsa's case to allow reporting of the fact she has two siblings and other details.\n\nOnly certain other details of the three children, who are Black, can be reported.\n\nHarry and Roman - not their real names - have since been adopted.\n\nBut barrister Kate Claxton, representing Newham London Borough Council, previously told the court that the ongoing investigation means that Elsa's birth cannot be registered, meaning no final decision regarding her care can be made.\n\nA further hearing in her case is expected to be held at a later date.\n\nDetective Sergeant Laurence Dight, from the Metropolitan Police, told the court on Monday that the police investigation into the identity of the parents remained ongoing, with anyone with information as to the parents' identities asked to contact the force using the reference CAD 6876/18 Jan.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London",

It is believed she was less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker, wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nShe was discovered at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, and was named Elsa by hospital staff who cared for her, in reference to the freezing temperatures in which she was found and the character from the film Frozen. The Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \"highly likely\" that Elsa was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nThe woman who left Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on the night of January 18, around half an hour before she was found.\n\nAppealing for her mother to come forward in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, urged anyone with information to urgently get in touch.\n\nThe BBC reported that a previous court hearing was told it took doctors three hours to record Elsa's temperature due to the cold, with the Met Office confirming temperatures dropped as low as minus 4C on the night.\n\nA court-appointed guardian asked the court at the earlier hearing to change the name picked by hospital staff, but Judge Atkinson refused the request as it gave the child something to \"hang on to\".\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April that due to ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nBaby Roman\n\nBaby Roman was also found in freezing temperatures just under five years earlier. Police were called to a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham at around 10.15pm on January 31 2019.\n\nThe force said at the time that the baby was found wrapped in a white towel which was put in a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playpark. No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nShe was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nRoman - not her real name - has since been adopted.\n\nBaby Harry\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA baby girl found abandoned in a shopping bag in east London earlier this year has two siblings who were found in similar circumstances in 2017 and 2019, it can now be reported.\n\nA judge at East London Family Court ruled on Monday that reporting restrictions could be changed to allow the publication of the link between the three children, following an application by the PA news agency and the BBC.\n\nIt comes after a child, named Baby Elsa by hospital staff, was found by a dog walker in Newham on January 18 this year in sub-zero temperatures.\n\nDNA testing has since shown she has a brother and sister, known as Baby Harry and Baby Roman, who were discovered abandoned in similar circumstances in the same area of the capital in 2017 and 2019 respectively.\n\nThe children's parents are yet to be identified, with the Metropolitan Police investigation into their identities ongoing.\n\nOn Monday, Judge Carol Atkinson ruled restrictions should be lifted to allow the reporting of the relationship between the children, claiming it was needed for the \"openness of justice\".\n\nShe said: \"There is a clear public interest in reporting this story.\n\n\"The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\"\n\nShe continued: \"It is for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me.\n\n\"If I restrict these rights and the reporting of that story, I think that does impact on public consciousness of these sorts of matters. It restricts the openness of justice.\"\n\nWhile journalists can usually attend family court proceedings, reporting restrictions limit what can be published to protect the anonymity of those involved.\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at 16 courts across England and Wales.\n\nJudges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFollowing an application made by PA and the BBC, Judge Atkinson varied the Transparency Order in Elsa's case to allow reporting of the fact she has two siblings and other details.\n\nOnly certain other details of the three children, who are black, may be reported.\n\nBaby Elsa was believed to be less than an hour old when she was found abandoned in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in East Ham on January 18 this year.\n\nHer sister, Baby Roman, was found in similar circumstances in a play area off Roman Road, Newham, in late January 2019, as freezing temperatures and snow gripped the capital.\n\nIn September 2017, Baby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket in Balaam Street, Plaistow.\n\nHarry and Roman - not their real names - have since been adopted.\n\nBut barrister Kate Claxton, representing Newham London Borough Council, previously told the court that the ongoing investigation means that Elsa's birth cannot be registered, meaning no final decision regarding her care can be made.\n\nA further hearing in her case is expected to be held at a later date.\n\nDetective Sergeant Laurence Dight, from the Metropolitan Police, told the court on Monday that the police investigation into the identity of the parents remained ongoing, with anyone with information as to the parents' identities asked to contact the force using the reference CAD 6876/18 Jan.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the force said it had made extensive inquiries including media appeals, analysing CCTV, going door to door and examining forensic evidence.\n\nDetective Inspector Jamie Humm, who is based in Newham, said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported.\n\n\"It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.\n\n\"We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount.\n\n\"We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType":

The children were found over a period of seven years, just miles apart from one another, The Mirror reports.\n\nThe other infant, Roman, was also found in a shopping bag, whilst the first baby, nicknamed Harry, was found wrapped in a blanket.\n\nHowever, despite the horrific discoveries, the police have been unable to identify their parents, prompting an appeal from the Met. An update was announced at East London Family Court on Monday, when the judge confirmed the news could be published.\n\nBelow we have highlighted the case of each sibling who were all found in similar conditions.\n\nBaby Elsa\n\nBaby Elsa was found in freezing temperatures in East Ham on the night of January 18 this year. It is believed she was less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker, wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nShe was discovered at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, and was named Elsa by hospital staff who cared for her, in reference to the freezing temperatures in which she was found and the character from the film Frozen. The Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \"highly likely\" Elsa was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nThe woman who left Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on the night of January 18, around half an hour before she was found.\n\nAppealing for her mother to come forward in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, urged anyone with information to urgently get in touch. The BBC reported a previous court hearing was told it took doctors three hours to record Elsa's temperature due to the cold, with the Met Office confirming temperatures dropped as low as minus 4C on the night.\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April due to ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nBaby Roman\n\nBaby Roman was also found in freezing temperatures just under five years earlier. Police were called to a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham at around 10.15pm on January 30 2019.\n\nThe force said at the time the baby was found wrapped in a white towel which was put in a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playpark. No attempt had been made to hide her. She was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nRoman, which is not her real name, has since been adopted.\n\nBaby Harry\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017. The boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Street in Plaistow, east London. Harry was cared for at a hospital before being discharged and has since been adopted.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source":

The children were found over a period of seven years and were found just miles apart. The other infant, Roman, was also found in a shopping bag, whilst the first baby, nicknamed Harry, was found wrapped in a blanket.\n\nDespite the development, their parents are yet to be identified which has prompted an updated appeal from the Metropolitan Police. The force has urged anyone with information to come forward. The update was announced at East London Family Court on Monday, when the judge confirmed the news could be published. Below we have highlighted the case of each sibling who were all found in similar conditions.\n\nBaby Elsa\n\nBaby Elsa was found in freezing temperatures in East Ham on the night of January 18 this year. It is believed she was less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker, wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nShe was discovered at the junction of Greenway and High Street South, and was named Elsa by hospital staff who cared for her, in reference to the freezing temperatures in which she was found and the character from the film Frozen. The Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \"highly likely\" that Elsa was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\". The woman who left Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on the night of January 18, around half an hour before she was found.\n\nAppealing for her mother to come forward in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, urged anyone with information to urgently get in touch. The BBC reported that a previous court hearing was told it took doctors three hours to record Elsa's temperature due to the cold, with the Met Office confirming temperatures dropped as low as minus 4C on the night.\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April that due to ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nBaby Roman\n\nBaby Roman was also found in freezing temperatures just under five years earlier. Police were called to a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham at around 10.15pm on January 30 2019.\n\nThe force said at the time that the baby was found wrapped in a white towel which was put in a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playpark. No attempt had been made to hide her. She was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nRoman, which is not her real name, has since been adopted.\n\nBaby Harry\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017. The boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Street in Plaistow, east London.

It restricts the openness of justice.\"\n\nA pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which began with three courts in 2023, was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at 16 courts across England and Wales.\n\nReporting restrictions limit what can be published to protect the anonymity of those involved.\n\nThe children's parents are yet to be identified, with the Metropolitan Police investigation into their identities ongoing.\n\nBaby Harry was found abandoned in a park area close to Balaam Street, Newham, at about 8.20am on Sunday 17 September 2017. He had been wrapped in a white blanket.\n\nBaby Roman was found abandoned by dog walkers in a small children's play park on Roman Road, near the junction with Saxon Road, at approximately 10.15pm on Thursday 31 January 2019. At the time freezing temperatures and snow gripped the capital.\n\nBoth children, who have been renamed, have since been adopted. But Elsa remains in foster care.\n\nBarrister Kate Claxton, representing Newham London Borough Council, previously told the court that the ongoing investigation means that Elsa's birth cannot be registered, so no final decision regarding her care can be made.\n\nOfficers believe a woman seen in the area just before Elsa was found may have vital information.\n\nThe woman was wearing a large dark-coloured coat with a light-coloured scarf or hood around her neck, and was carrying a rucksack.\n\nThe Met said it has made extensive inquiries including media appeals, analysing CCTV, going door to door and examining forensic evidence.\n\nMet Detective Inspector Jamie Humm said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.\n\n\"We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount.\n\n\"We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Judge Carol Atkinson said on Monday (June 3) at East London Family Court that it can be published that the child, known as Baby Elsa, has a brother and a sister who were discovered alone in 2017 and 2019 respectively.\n\nThe parents of the three children are yet to be identified, with the Metropolitan Police reiterating their call for anyone with information to come forward. Below looks at the discovery of the three infants, who were found within a few miles of each other\n\nREAD MORE: Mum denies manslaughter of two sets of twin boys who died in Sutton house fire\n\nBaby Elsa\n\nBaby Elsa was found in freezing temperatures in East Ham on the night of January 18 this year. It is believed she was less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker, wrapped in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nShe was discovered at the junction of Greenway and High Street South and was named Elsa by hospital staff who cared for her, in reference to the freezing temperatures in which she was found and the character from the film Frozen. The Metropolitan Police said at the time it was \"highly likely\" that Elsa was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nThe woman who left Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on the night of January 18, around half an hour before she was found. Appealing for her mother to come forward in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, lead for policing in Newham, urged anyone with information to urgently get in touch.\n\nThe BBC reported that a previous court hearing was told it took doctors three hours to record Elsa's temperature due to the cold, with the Met Office confirming temperatures dropped as low as minus 4C on the night. A court-appointed guardian asked the court at the earlier hearing to change the name picked by hospital staff, but Judge Atkinson refused the request as it gave the child something to \"hang on to\".\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April that due to an ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nBaby Roman\n\nBaby Roman was also found in freezing temperatures just under five years earlier. Police were called to a park area close to Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham at around 10.15pm on January 30 2019.\n\nThe force said at the time that the baby was found wrapped in a white towel which was put in a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playpark. No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nShe was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag. Roman - not her real name - has since been adopted.\n\nBaby Harry\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017. The boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Road in Plaistow, East London. Harry - not his real name - was cared for at a hospital before being discharged and has since been adopted.\n\nDon't miss out on the biggest East London news.

No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nShe was found by a dog walker, Rima Zvaliauskas, who told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nBaby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket and abandoned in a park on September 17 2017.\n\nThe boy, named Harry by medical staff, was discovered in an area off Balaam Road in Plaistow, east London.\n\nHarry - not his real name - was cared for at a hospital before being discharged and has since been adopted.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenway_footpath,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenway footpath, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Ham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Ham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Ham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Newham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Newham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Newham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newham_London_Borough_Council", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newham London Borough Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balaam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Met Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaistow,_Newham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaistow, Newham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Plaistow, Newham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets_and_Bedding", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Blankets and Bedding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Infant_and_Toddlers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Infant and Toddlers", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://d3gvyx4eg3tne0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Img38194506.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622550", "eventUri": "eng-9622550", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-18", "textStart": 762, "textEnd": 772, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-17", "textStart": 2701, "textEnd": 2718}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

She was not injured in any way.\n\nPolice are still looking for a woman who was spotted in the area wearing a dark coat with a light-coloured scarf or hood around her neck and rucksack on her back shortly before Elsa was found.\n\nIt is thought the woman could hold important information about how the child came to be abandoned.\n\nDNA tests have since shown that the girl is the biological sibling of Harry, who was found abandoned in a park in Plaistow in 2017, and Roman, who was discovered in a park in Newham in 2019.\n\nJudge Carol Atkinson on Monday amended restrictions at East London Family Court to permit the familial link between the three children to be reported, following an appeal by PA news agency and the BBC.\n\nShe said that it was needed for the \"openness of justice\" as there is \"enormous interest\" in identifying the children's parents.\n\nThe oldest child, known as Harry, was abandoned in a park close to Balaam Street in Plaistow, east London, on September 17, 2017.\n\nHe was found wrapped in a white blanket at 8.20am before being taken to hospital, triggering a police appeal for his mother to come forward.\n\nOfficers said at the time that they were concerned for his mother's welfare and have appealed for her to come forward.\n\nHis sister, Baby Roman, was found in similar circumstances in a play area off Roman Road, Newham, at around 10.15pm on January 31 2019, amid freezing temperatures and heavy snow.\n\nShe was wrapped in a white towel inside a shopping bag and then placed on the ground next to a bench in the small children's playground. No attempt had been made to hide her.\n\nDog walker Rima Zvaliauskas, who found the child, told the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" by the discovery after hearing a noise coming from a bag.\n\nShe added, in an interview with Sun Online: \"At first I thought it was an animal.\"\n\nHer son, Ovidijus, who was with her at the time, added: \"She looked a bit purple. She [was] very cold to the touch. Her forehead and ears looked like they were a bit frosty.\n\n\"We feel great that we helped save the baby's life. I'm glad we were there or the baby might not have survived too much longer.\"\n\nHarry and Roman - not their real names - have since been adopted.\n\nBaby Elsa was found in a reusable shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in East Ham at 9.13pm on January 18 this year, as temperatures plunged to -4C. Police said at the time that it was \"highly likely\" she was born after a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nThe woman who left her was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm, around half an hour before she was discovered.\n\nTania Iurac, a restaurant manager, said she saw a \"commotion\" on her walk home from work, adding the baby was left in a \"really visible area\".\n\nMs Iruac, 25, told MailOnline at the time: \"I saw a commotion by Greenway park. We saw a white towel on the floor surrounded by six to seven police officers.\n\n\"I think the mother wanted the baby to be found. The towel was in a really visible area next to the main road. It was absolutely freezing last night.\"\n\nA court-appointed guardian asked the court at a previous hearing to change Elsa's name, but Judge Atkinson refused the request as it gave the child something to \"hang on to\".\n\nBarristers for Newham London Borough Council told the court in April that due to ongoing investigation into the identity of her parents, no final decision on her care could be made, with a future hearing expected at a later date.\n\nWhile journalists can usually attend family court proceedings, reporting restrictions limit what can be published to protect the anonymity of those involved.\n\nBut under a pilot scheme to increase transparency in the family court system, which was brought in last year, journalists and legal bloggers are given access to three family courts - Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle - to report on cases more freely.\n\nThis was expanded earlier this year to permit reporting on cases at 16 courts across England and Wales.\n\nFollowing an application made by PA and the BBC, Judge Atkinson varied the Transparency Order in Elsa's case to allow reporting of the fact she has two siblings and other details.\n\nOnly certain other details of the three children, who are black, may be reported.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_henderson@telegraph.co.uk",

The court has since heard that she is doing well.\n\nThe older children have been adopted and Baby Elsa remains in foster care.\n\nPolice are now hunting for the parents of the three tots, with cops saying at the time it was 'highly likely' Elsa was born after a 'concealed pregnancy'.\n\nThe three children were found in parks in east London over a seven-year period and their parents have still not been found\n\nBaby Harry (pictured) was found abandoned in a park in Plaistow, east London, in September 2017\n\nBaby Roman (pictured) was found abandoned in a park in Newham, east London, near a year and a half later in January 2019\n\nThey added that her umbilical cord was still attached when she was found. She was not injured in any way.\n\nPolice have today said they are continuing to look for the children's' parents, with officers believing a woman seen in the area just before Elsa was discovered by a dog walker might have vital information.\n\nREAD MOREBREAKING NEWS Baby found dumped in shopping bag on London street on 'extremely cold' minus 4C night was just one hour old, police reveal as hospital staff name her Elsa\n\nThe female was wearing a large dark-coloured coat with a light-coloured scarf or hood around her neck, and was carrying a rucksack.\n\nThe mother and father of the three babies - which were dumped within 1.7 miles of each other - have still not been identified and on Monday a judge allowed details revealing the link between them to be reported in public for the first time.\n\nJudge Carol Atkinson at the East London Family Court amended restrictions to allow the familial link between the three to be reported following an application by PA news agency and the BBC.\n\nShe said it was of 'great public interest' and doing so could help identify the biological parents who still have not been found.\n\nDetective Sergeant Laurence Dight, from the Metropolitan Police, told the court on Monday that the police investigation into the identity of the parents is continuing, with anyone with information as to the parents' identities asked to contact the force using the reference CAD 6876/18 Jan.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the force said it had made extensive inquiries including media appeals, analysing CCTV, going door to door and examining forensic evidence.\n\nA street view of the park where Harry was found close to Balaam Street in Plaistow, east London, on September 17, 2017\n\nDetective Inspector Jamie Humm, who is based in Newham, said: 'We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported.\n\n'It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n'We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.\n\n'We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount.\n\n'We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.'\n\nThe oldest child, known as Harry, was found in a park close to Balaam Street in Plaistow, east London, on September 17, 2017.\n\nHe was found wrapped in a white blanket at 8.20am before being rushed to hospital, sparking a police appeal for the mother to come forward.\n\nRima Zvaliauskiene, 50, and her son Ovidijus Zvaliaskiene, 27, who found Roman abandoned in a park in Newham in 2019\n\nThis was followed by the discovery of the second baby who was found inside a shopping bag next to a bench in a park in Newham, east London, on January 31, 2019.\n\nThe child, who was named Roman after being found on Roman Road, was reportedly wrapped in a towel and placed in a Sainsbury's bag.\n\nThe newborn was found by a Lithuanian grandmother and her son while they were walking their dog 100 yards from their home.\n\nRima Zvaliauskiene said at the time: 'There was a crying noise from the bag. She was crying for her life. The baby saved herself.'\n\nShe added, in an interview with Sun Online: 'At first I thought it was an animal'.\n\nHer son, Ovidijus, added: 'She looked a bit purple. She very cold to the touch. Her forehead and ears looked like they were a bit frosty, she was cold.\n\n'We feel great that we helped save the baby's life. I'm glad we were there or the baby might not have survived too much longer'.\n\nPolice launched another appeal for the mother to come forward after this, but the fact that Roman was related to Harry was not made public knowledge.\n\nAn aerial view of the park next to Roman Road in Newham, where baby Roman was found abandoned in 2019\n\nThe bench where Roman was found dumped in a shopping bag in a park near Roman Road in Newham, east London, on January 31, 2019\n\nThen on January 18 this year a third newborn, known as Elsa, was found by a dog walker at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in Newham after being alerted by her crying.\n\nLike with Roman, Elsa was found dumped in a shopping bag and was believed to be just one-hour old when she was found at 9.13pm as temperatures plunged to -4C on the cold winter night.\n\nOne local restaurant manager, Tania Iurac, told how she saw a 'commotion' while walking home from work after the newborn was left in a 'really visible area'.\n\nMs Iurac, 25, said she and her flatmate saw up to seven police officers at the scene around two hours after the baby was discovered.\n\nREAD MORE Fears grow for mother of baby named Harry found abandoned in park in carefully-wrapped white blanket as police urge her to seek medical help\n\n'I saw a commotion by Greenway park. We saw a white towel on the floor surrounded by six to seven police officers.\n\n'The towel was by a red route clearway sign. But the baby and the plastic bag weren't there.\n\n'I think the mother wanted the baby to be found. The towel was in a really visible area next to the main road. It was absolutely freezing last night.'\n\nHer friend Andreea Plic, 26, explained that she was concerned by the number of officers in the area as she walked back from work at around 11pm and decided it was best to get home.\n\nShe told The Times: 'I talked with my friend, Tania, and I said, let's go outside to ask what happened. So when I go outside, I just saw the towel.'\n\nMs Iurac said that it was 'horrible' finding out someone had done this, but added to the newspaper: 'She may be a teenager and being scared about what happened in her life and not being ready for it, and left it outside for someone to find it.'\n\nAndreea Maria Plic (left) and Tania Iurac said they saw police officers huddling around a white towel after Elsa was found in Newham in January this year\n\nSpeaking a day after Elsa was found Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, said the child was believed to be black or mixed race and urged the mother to make herself known.\n\nHe said: 'We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.\n\n'Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby's mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances, please do seek help.'\n\nREAD MORE Police release new heartbreaking footage of tiny baby abandoned in a London park by his mystery mother as they beg her to seek help\n\nHarry and Roman have both since been adopted, while Elsa is still in care. The names of all three have since been changed.\n\nBarrister Kate Claxton, representing Newham London Borough Council, previously told the court that the ongoing investigation means that Elsa's birth cannot be registered, so no final decision regarding her care can be made.\n\nA further hearing in her case is expected to be held at a later date.\n\nJudge Atkinson ruled on Monday that reporting the information that the three children were biological siblings was in the public interest.\n\nShe said: 'There is a clear public interest in reporting this story.\n\n'The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\n\n'It is, for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me.\n\n'If I restrict these rights and the reporting of that story, I think that does impact on public consciousness of these sorts of matters. It restricts the openness of justice.'\n\nIt comes following efforts to increase transparency in the family court system.\n\nBaby Elsa was found abandoned in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South (pictured) in Newham, east London, on January 18, this year\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, pictured at a press conference in Newham following the discovery of Elsa in January this year\n\nPreviously, reporters have had access to courts dealing with sensitive matters involving children, despite them being closed to the public.\n\nHowever, reporting has been highly restricted to only what a judge will allow, to protect the identities of those involved.\n\nUnder a new transparency pilot scheme, introduced last year, accredited journalists and legal bloggers could access three family courts - Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle - to report on cases more freely.\n\nThis was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases to 16 courts across England and Wales as they happen, as they would do in the criminal courts.\n\nThis includes East London Family Court, as well as Manchester, Nottingham, the Central Family Court in London and others.\n\nWhile the identities of the families and certain professionals involved remain protected, judges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFamilies can also talk to a journalist about their case, without risking punishment for contempt of court.\n\nHowever, judges can still decide that some cases may not be reported on or that reporting should be postponed in certain circumstances.\n\nIn Baby Elsa's case, the PA news agency and the BBC applied for the court to vary the terms of the Transparency Order to allow reporting that she has two siblings and other details.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

In terms of health she was described as well, the court heard. It was also told there were plans for the siblings to have contact as they grew up.\n\nThe public reporting of the sibling links was not supported by the public bodies that advise courts about children's best interests. East London family court is part of a pilot study that has partly lifted automatic restrictions on the reporting of family proceedings.\n\nDet Jamie Humm, from the northeast command unit, which covers Newham, said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success. We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount. We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.\"\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics in the UK show there were only 12 abandoned babies recorded in England and Wales between 2005 and 2014.\n\nIn a note about the data the Office for National Statistics said: \"Few, if any, details are known about abandoned children, and they are not included in birth statistics. However, since 1977 these infants have been included in the abandoned children register maintained at the General Register Office in Southport.\"\n\nA study published by University College London in 2009 found that official figures understated the problem, and estimated that 16 babies were abandoned each year in the UK. -

Like Elsa, she was found by a dog-walker in freezing temperatures wrapped in a towel inside a shopping bag.\n\nElsa and Roman also have an older brother, who was provisionally named Harry after he was found wrapped in a blanket in another east London park in Plaistow in September 2017.\n\nThe two older children have since been adopted and given different names.\n\nThe parents of all three children have yet to be identified, as the Metropolitan police reiterated a call for anyone with information to come forward.\n\nRelated: Baby girl found in bag in east London was less than hour old, police say\n\nOn Monday, a judge in a family court ruled that the relationship between the siblings could be reported because of the public interest of the case, due to the rarity of babies being abandoned.\n\nIn the ruling, which came after an appeal by the BBC and PA Media, Carol Atkinson, the most senior judge at east London family court, said: \"Abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event.\"\n\nShe acknowledged there would be \"enormous interest\" in the sibling relationship between the three children.\n\nThe BBC and PA argued that reporting the sibling links would help the police find the parents of the three children.\n\nBaby Elsa was discovered by a dog-walker on 18 January. It is believed she was less than an hour old when she found with her umbilical cord still attached. Hospital staff gave her the name Elsa in reference to a character in the film Frozen, due to the sub-zero temperatures in which she was found.\n\nAt the time the Metropolitan police said it was highly likely that Elsa was born after a concealed pregnancy.\n\nA woman was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at about 8.45pm on the night of 18 January, about half an hour before the baby was found.\n\nElsa remains in foster care. In terms of health, she was described as well, the court heard.\n\nIt was also told there were plans for the siblings to have contact as they grew up. The public reporting of the sibling links was not supported by the public bodies which advise courts about children's best interests.\n\nEast London family court is part of a pilot study that has partly lifted automatic restrictions on the reporting of family proceedings.\n\nDI Jamie Humm, from the north-east command unit, which covers Newham, said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.\n\n\"We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount.\n\n\"We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.\"\n\nFigures from the Office for National Statistics show there were only 12 abandoned babies recorded in England and Wales between 2005 and 2014.\n\nIn a note about the data, the ONS said: \"Few, if any, details are known about abandoned children, and they are not included in birth statistics. However, since 1977, these infants have been included in the abandoned children register maintained at the General Register Office in Southport.\"\n\nBut a study published by University College London in 2009 found that official figures understated the problem, and estimated that 16 babies were abandoned each year in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She was crying for her life. The baby saved herself.'\n\nShe added, in an interview with Sun Online: 'At first I thought it was an animal'.\n\nHer son, Ovidijus, added: 'She looked a bit purple. She very cold to the touch. Her forehead and ears looked like they were a bit frosty, she was cold.\n\n'We feel great that we helped save the baby's life. I'm glad we were there or the baby might not have survived too much longer'.\n\nPolice launched another appeal for the mother to come forward after this, but the fact that Roman was related to Harry was not made public knowledge.\n\nRima Zvaliauskiene, 50, and her son Ovidijus Zvaliaskiene, 27, who found Roman abandoned in a park in Newham in 2019\n\nAn aerial view of the park next to Roman Road in Newham, where baby Roman was found abandoned in 2019\n\nThe bench where Roman was found dumped in a shopping bag in a park near Roman Road in Newham, east London, on January 31, 2019\n\nThen on January 18 this year a third newborn, known as Elsa, was found by a dog walker at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in Newham after being alerted by her crying.\n\nLike with Roman, Elsa was found dumped in a shopping bag and was believed to be just one-hour old when she was found at 9.13pm as temperatures plunged to -4C on the cold winter night.\n\nOne local restaurant manager, Tania Iurac, told how she saw a 'commotion' while walking home from work after the newborn was left in a 'really visible area'.\n\nMs Iurac, 25, said she and her flatmate saw up to seven police officers at the scene around two hours after the baby was discovered.\n\nREAD MORE Fears grow for mother of baby named Harry found abandoned in park in carefully-wrapped white blanket as police urge her to seek medical help\n\n'I saw a commotion by Greenway park.

It was absolutely freezing last night.'\n\nHer friend Andreea Plic, 26, explained that she was concerned by the number of officers in the area as she walked back from work at around 11pm and decided it was best to get home.\n\nShe told The Times: 'I talked with my friend, Tania, and I said, let's go outside to ask what happened. So when I go outside, I just saw the towel.'\n\nMs Iurac said that it was 'horrible' finding out someone had done this, but added to the newspaper: 'She may be a teenager and being scared about what happened in her life and not being ready for it, and left it outside for someone to find it.'\n\nAndreea Maria Plic (left) and Tania Iurac said they saw police officers huddling around a white towel after Elsa was found in Newham in January this year\n\nSpeaking a day after Elsa was found Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, said the child was believed to be black or mixed race and urged the mother to make herself known.\n\nHe said: 'We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.\n\n'Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station.

It restricts the openness of justice.'\n\nIt comes following efforts to increase transparency in the family court system.\n\nBaby Elsa was found abandoned in a shopping bag at the junction of Greenway and High Street South (pictured) in Newham, east London, on January 18, this year\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, pictured at a press conference in Newham following the discovery of Elsa in January this year\n\nPreviously, reporters have had access to courts dealing with sensitive matters involving children, despite them being closed to the public.\n\nHowever, reporting has been highly restricted to only what a judge will allow, to protect the identities of those involved.\n\nUnder a new transparency pilot scheme, introduced last year, accredited journalists and legal bloggers could access three family courts - Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle - to report on cases more freely.\n\nThis was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases to 16 courts across England and Wales as they happen, as they would do in the criminal courts.\n\nThis includes East London Family Court, as well as Manchester, Nottingham, the Central Family Court in London and others.\n\nWhile the identities of the families and certain professionals involved remain protected, judges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFamilies can also talk to a journalist about their case, without risking punishment for contempt of court.\n\nHowever, judges can still decide that some cases may not be reported on or that reporting should be postponed in certain circumstances.\n\nIn Baby Elsa's case, the PA news agency and the BBC applied for the court to vary the terms of the Transparency Order to allow reporting that she has two siblings and other details.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The children were found over a seven-year period, just miles apart from each other, according to The Mirror.\n\nThe other infant, Roman, was also found in a shopping bag, while the first baby, dubbed Harry, was discovered wrapped in a blanket.\n\nDespite these shocking discoveries, police have been unable to identify the parents, leading to an appeal from the Met. An update was announced at East London Family Court on Monday, when the judge confirmed the news could be published.\n\nHere we detail the circumstances of each sibling, all found in similar conditions, reports the Daily Record.\n\nBaby Elsa was discovered in freezing temperatures in East Ham on the evening of January 18 this year. It's believed she was less than an hour old when a dog walker found her, swaddled in a towel in a reusable shopping bag with her umbilical cord still attached.\n\nThe baby girl was discovered at the juncture of Greenway and High Street South. Hospital staff affectionately named her Elsa, after the character from Disney's 'Frozen', reflecting the icy conditions she was found in.\n\nAt the time, the Metropolitan Police suggested it was \"highly likely\" that Elsa was born following a \"concealed pregnancy\".\n\nElsa's mother was seen entering Greenway through the High Street South entry around 8.45pm on January 18, about half an hour before the baby girl was located.\n\nIn a plea for Elsa's mother to surface back in January, Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, head of Newham police force, encouraged anyone with relevant information to get in touch immediately. According to the BBC, doctors took three hours to record Elsa's frigid temperature, with confirmation from the Met Office that mercury readings plunged to as low as minus 4C on that night.\n\nIn April, representatives for Newham London Borough Council explained to the court that Elsa's future care couldn't be determined due to ongoing probes into identifying her parents. A hearing is set to take place at a later date.\n\nAnother baby boy, Roman, experienced a similar fate just under five years earlier to Elsa's discovery. The police were summoned to a park spot near Roman Road and Saxon Road in East Ham approximately 10.15pm on January 30, 2019.\n\nThe force reported that when the baby was discovered, she was wrapped in a white towel inside a shopping bag placed beside a bench in a children's playpark. There was no effort to conceal her.\n\nRima Zvaliauskas, who found her while walking her dog, expressed to the BBC in 2019 that she was \"shocked and stressed\" upon hearing noises from the bag.\n\nThe child, referred to here as Roman, which is not her real name, has been adopted since then.\n\nIn another case, Baby Harry was found swaddled in a white blanket and left alone in a park on September 17, 2017. Named Harry by the hospital staff, he was found in an area off Balaam Street in Plaistow, East London.\n\nAfter receiving care at a hospital, Harry was discharged and has also been adopted.",

children abandoned as newborns", "body": "UK police said Tuesday they were trying to locate the parents of three young children who were all abandoned separately as newborn babies, after a judge lifted reporting restrictions on the case.\n\nFormal investigations were launched after each discovery in 2017, 2019 and January this year, when a baby girl was found dumped in a shopping bag in freezing conditions in east London.\n\nBut it can only now be reported that all three cases are linked, and that the children -- two girls and a boy -- are related.\n\nDNA testing of the youngest child, named Baby Elsa by hospital staff, showed she has a brother, Baby Harry, and a sister, Baby Roman, who were found in the same area in similar circumstances.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has been trying to trace the children's parents \"so far without success\", said Detective Inspector Jamie Humm.\n\n\"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported,\" he added.\n\n\"It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\"\n\nOfficers have worked around-the-clock probing each case. \"We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation,\" Humm said.\n\nA family court judge on Monday approved the release of details about the cases, lifting the normally strict reporting restrictions on minors and family matters in the interests of \"openness of justice\".\n\n\"There is a clear public interest in reporting this story,\" said judge Carol Atkinson, granting an application by two UK media outlets to report the link between the three siblings.\n\n\"The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\"\n\nElsa was believed to be less than an hour old when she was found by a dog walker in the East Ham neighbourhood on January 18.\n\nHer sister, Baby Roman, was found in similar circumstances in a play area in Newham in late January 2019, as freezing temperatures and snow gripped the capital.\n\nMeanwhile in September 2017, Baby Harry was found wrapped in a white blanket in Plaistow.\n\nHarry and Roman -- not their real names --

The dog owner quickly realised the sounds were coming from a shopping bag, left at the junction of Greenway and High Street South.\n\nThe abandonded newborn baby girl inside is believed to have been around one hour old at the time of her discovery, with her umbilical cord still intact.\n\nThat evening, temperatures had dropped to -4C, while weather warnings for snow and ice were in place up and down the country. The child, who hospital staff later named Elsa, after the Disney princess with icy powers, only had a towel to protect against the frost.\n\nThe Good Samaritan did their best to keep Elsa warm while they waited for paramedics. The 6lbs 6oz baby, believed to have been a full-term infant, was so cold that it took doctors three hours to record her temperature, as per court documents. She was however responsive and was soon feeding well. By the time she was discharged to foster parents the following week, little Elsa was declared fit and well, despite her harrowing ordeal.\n\nAt the time, Metropolitan Police stated that it was 'highly likely' Elsa was born following a 'concealed pregnancy', and appealed for her birth mother to come forward. The woman who abandoned Elsa was spotted entering the Greenway from the High Street South entrance at approximately 8.45pm that evening, just half an hour before the discovery.\n\nNow DNA testing has revealed Elsa has two siblings, both of whom were abandoned under similar circumstances over a seven-year period. While we do not have information about the parents, the BBC and PA Media were given special permission by the court to report the sibling link and that the children are Black.\n\nJudge Carol Atkinson confirmed that Elsa's brother and sister, who also survived their ordeals, were similarly discovered alone in 2017 and 2019, just a few short miles apart. Her brother, nicknamed Harry, was found wrapped in a blanket and left in a Plaistow park on September 17, 2017, while her sister, Roman, was discovered on the night of January 30, 2019, by another dog walker. Roman, which is not her real name, has since been adopted. Meanwhile Baby Harry, who was named by medical staff, has also been adopted.\n\nIn a recent statement, Detective Inspector Jamie Humm from the North East Command Unit said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.

He has also since been adopted and renamed.\n\nOn Monday a judge at East London Family Court amended reporting restrictions to allow the link between the siblings to reach the public domain, following an application by the PA news agency and the BBC.\n\nThe children's parents have not been identified and the Metropolitan Police is still investigating all three abandonments.\n\nIt is a criminal offence to abandon a child under the age of 2 and the punishment could include a custodial sentence.\n\nBut magistrates and judges usually consider a parent's state of mind and personal circumstances and it is extremely rare for mothers to be jailed in such cases.\n\nDeciding to lift reporting restrictions, Judge Carol Atkinson, sitting in the Family Court, said: \"There is a clear public interest in reporting this story. The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\"\n\n\"It is for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me,\" she added.\n\nLast year the government began to allow journalists to cover family court proceedings, which had previously been kept secret.\n\nA pilot scheme which began with three courts in 2023 was expanded earlier this year to allow journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases at 16 courts across England and Wales.\n\nBut reporting restrictions usually protect the identity of all those involved.\n\nIn the case of Elsa and her siblings only certain details, such as the fact the children are black, can be reported.\n\nKate Claxton, a barrister representing the London Borough of Newham, told an earlier hearing the police investigation means Elsa's birth cannot be registered, which means no final decision can be made regarding her care.\n\nA further hearing is expected to be held later this year to decide if she can be made available for adoption, like her siblings.\n\nIt is not clear if Harry and Roman were adopted by the same family.\n\nDetective Sergeant Laurence Dight, from the Metropolitan Police, told the court on Monday anyone with information about the identity of the children's mother, or indeed their father, should contact the police using reference CAD 6876/18 Jan.\n\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, Detective Inspector Jamie Humm said, \"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success.\"\n\n\"We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for.

She was crying for her life. The baby saved herself.'\n\nShe added, in an interview with Sun Online: 'At first I thought it was an animal'.\n\nHer son, Ovidijus, added: 'She looked a bit purple. She very cold to the touch. Her forehead and ears looked like they were a bit frosty, she was cold.\n\n'We feel great that we helped save the baby's life. I'm glad we were there or the baby might not have survived too much longer'.\n\nChief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, pictured at a press conference in Newham following the discovery of Elsa in January this year\n\nRima Zvaliauskiene, 50, and her son Ovidijus Zvaliaskiene, 27, who found Roman abandoned in a park in Newham in 2019\n\nAn aerial view of the park next to Roman Road in Newham, where baby Roman was found abandoned in 2019\n\nPolice launched another appeal for the mother to come forward after this, but the fact that Roman was related to Harry was not made public knowledge.\n\nThen on January 18 this year a third newborn, known as Elsa, was found by a dog walker at the junction of Greenway and High Street South in Newham after being alerted by her crying.\n\nLike with Roman, Elsa was found dumped in a shopping bag and was believed to be just one-hour old when she was found at 9.13pm as temperatures plunged to -4C on the cold winter night.\n\nREAD MORE Fears grow for mother of baby named Harry found abandoned in park in carefully-wrapped white blanket as police urge her to seek medical help\n\nOne local restaurant manager, Tania Iurac, told how she saw a 'commotion' while walking home from work after the newborn was left in a 'really visible area'.\n\nMs Iurac, 25, said she and her flatmate saw up to seven police officers at the scene around two hours after the baby was discovered.\n\n'I saw a commotion by Greenway park. We saw a white towel on the floor surrounded by six to seven police officers.\n\n'The towel was by a red route clearway sign. But the baby and the plastic bag weren't there.\n\n'I think the mother wanted the baby to be found. The towel was in a really visible area next to the main road. It was absolutely freezing last night.'\n\nHer friend Andreea Plic, 26, explained that she was concerned by the number of officers in the area as she walked back from work at around 11pm and decided it was best to get home.\n\nShe told The Times: 'I talked with my friend, Tania, and I said, let's go outside to ask what happened. So when I go outside, I just saw the towel.'\n\nMs Iurac said that it was 'horrible' finding out someone had done this, but added to the newspaper: 'She may be a teenager and being scared about what happened in her life and not being ready for it, and left it outside for someone to find it.'\n\nAndreea Maria Plic (left) and Tania Iurac said they saw police officers huddling around a white towel after Elsa was found in Newham in January this year\n\nSpeaking a day after Elsa was found Chief Superintendent Simon Crick, local policing commander for north-east London, said the child was believed to be black or mixed race and urged the mother to make herself known.\n\nHe said: 'We are extremely concerned for her welfare as she would have been through a traumatic ordeal and will be in need of immediate medical attention following the birth.\n\n'Trained medics and specialist officers are ready to support her and we urge her to get in touch by phone or walk into the nearest hospital or police station. If you are the baby's mother, please know that your daughter is well. No matter what your circumstances, please do seek help.'\n\nHarry and Roman have both since been adopted, while Elsa is still in care.\n\nJudge Atkinson ruled on Monday that reporting the information that the three children were biological siblings was in the public interest.\n\nShe said: 'There is a clear public interest in reporting this story.\n\n'The abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event and there are years where there are no children abandoned, and because of that it is the story of the abandoning of a child that is of public interest.\n\n'It is, for the same reason, in our current society, of enormous interest and importance that people know that there is a mother and father out there who felt the need to relinquish their children in this way, three times, and that is of considerable interest, it seems to me.\n\n'If I restrict these rights and the reporting of that story, I think that does impact on public consciousness of these sorts of matters. It restricts the openness of justice.'\n\nIt comes following efforts to increase transparency in the family court system.\n\nPreviously, reporters have had access to courts dealing with sensitive matters involving children, despite them being closed to the public.\n\nHowever, reporting has been highly restricted to only what a judge will allow, to protect the identities of those involved.\n\nUnder a new transparency pilot scheme, introduced last year, accredited journalists and legal bloggers could access three family courts - Leeds, Cardiff and Carlisle - to report on cases more freely.\n\nThis was expanded earlier this year to allow accredited journalists and legal bloggers to report on cases to 16 courts across England and Wales as they happen, as they would do in the criminal courts.\n\nThis includes East London Family Court, as well as Manchester, Nottingham, the Central Family Court in London and others.\n\nWhile the identities of the families and certain professionals involved remain protected, judges can set out what details may be reported under a Transparency Order, with journalists also allowed to access some documents.\n\nFamilies can also talk to a journalist about their case, without risking punishment for contempt of court.\n\nHowever, judges can still decide that some cases may not be reported on or that reporting should be postponed in certain circumstances.\n\nIn Baby Elsa's case, the PA news agency and the BBC applied for the court to vary the terms of the Transparency Order to allow reporting that she has two siblings and other details.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc",

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2024.

Temperatures were around 26.6 degrees Fahrenheit in London on the night she was discovered, Reuters and Sky News previously reported.\n\nDetective Inspector Jamie Humm from the North East Command Unit, which covers Newham, said, \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\"\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success,\" Humm added, per the news release.\n\n\"We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount,\" the inspector added.\n\n\"We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation,\" Humm concluded.\n\nNever miss a

The other infant, named Roman, was also discovered in a shopping bag in 2017. The first baby, later named Harry, was found wrapped in a blanket in 2019. The update was revealed at East London Family Court on Monday after the judge gave permission for the information to be released to the public. Now, the Met Police have re-issued an appeal in a bid to locate the children's mother. It comes after DNA testing revealed that the children are related.\n\nDetective Inspector Jamie Humm from the North East Command Unit which covers Newham said: \"We understand the significant public interest that will come following the lifting of restrictions that allow this information to be reported. It is significant news and our work has focused on trying to locate the mother and provide support to her.\n\n\"We have worked 24/7 in each of these three cases to identify the parents, so far without success. We have also had to be mindful of the sensitivities that exist now all of the children are being cared for. Their welfare, including their privacy, is paramount. We continue to investigate, and will consider the next steps in our investigation.\" Earlier this year, police released the description of a woman that they were keen to speak to.\n\nThe woman was seen entering the Greenway, E6 from the High Street South entrance at around 8.45pm on January 18. Chief Superintendent Simon Crick said at the time: \"We've collected a considerable volume of CCTV footage. While we're still examining it in detail, we have identified a woman we would like to speak to, and a witness who may have seen her. We believe the woman is Black, was wearing a large dark coat with a light coloured scarf or hood around her neck and had a rucksack on her back. \"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "monica_charsley@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Monica Charsley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Newham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Newham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Newham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courts of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_East_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North East England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backpack"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Baby", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Infant_and_Toddlers", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Infant and Toddlers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32957333.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TM240119Baby5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622550", "eventUri": "eng-9622550", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-18", "textStart": 380, "textEnd": 390, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The little girl, who was named baby Elsa by hospital staff and is now 'doing well' in foster care, is the sister of two other babies that were abandoned by the same mother and father, and have since been adopted under new names which cannot be disclosed.\n\nBaby Harry was found on September 16, 2017, at Plaistow Park, Balaam Street and on January 31, 2019, while the middle sister, named by officials as baby Roman, had been left at Roman Road playing fields. Clinical psychologist, Dr Jo Mueller, who specialises in working with parents and has carried out research on abandoned babies, has raised concern for the mental well-being of the parents, along with the physical health of the mother.\n\nShe says it is 'extremely rare' for babies to be abandoned in the UK, echoing comments made by the most senior judge of East London Family Court, Carol Atkinson. As DNA evidence was presented in court referring to the children, the judge said: \"Abandonment of a baby in this country is a very, very unusual event,\" before adding that the fact the siblings were found in similar circumstances years apart is \"of enormous interest\" in \"our current society\". While we do not have information about the parents, the BBC and PA Media were given special permission by the court to report the sibling link and that the children are Black.\n\nSpeaking from her experience and research, Dr Mueller believes those who abandon newborns instead of seeking support from social services are \"likely to be extremely vulnerable.\" The 40-year-old, from Tunbridge Wells, told the Mirror: \"It's quite likely that these mothers are traumatised, marginalised, and potentially suffering from mental health difficulties.\n\n\"Potentially these people may be refugees, people who've got unstable housing situations. They may be worried about coming into contact with services because of the repercussions of that, if they aren't here legally, potentially.\"\n\nIt is illegal to abandon a baby in the UK, however in the absence of national policy or comprehensive data, Mueller's research found the phenomenon is poorly understood. In her 2009 study published by the University College London Medical School, Department of Infection and Population Health, alongside authors L. Sherr and Z. Fox, they said abandonment is not a new phenomenon and is often subject to social change and circumstance.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) only published data until 2015, which showed no babies were registered as abandoned for the previous three years. There was just one logged as abandoned in 2011. However Dr Mueller's research in 2009, covering the period 1998-2005, suggested an average of 16 babies were abandoned yearly. They looked at the statistics to try and figure out how often it was actually happening in the UK, matching up media reports, crime statistics and the child register.\n\n\"It is a crime but it is often not well recorded because parents aren't found,\" the doctor explained. \"But from a psychological perspective, we're not often thinking of parents abandoning their babies as criminals.\" She added: \"I think that's the reason why there aren't any clear policies around what should happen when it happens.\n\n\"There aren't systematic processes because it's so rare that it's not seen as sort of urgent to create a pathway. Police may record the data, but a large proportion of the parents are never found.\" Through systematic coding of media reports, 124 babies were identified over a seven-year period.\n\nOf these, 96 (77.4%) were newborns (<1 week old) and 28 (22.6%) were older babies (>1 week old). Most babies (74%) were abandoned outdoors and only 9.7% were left with a memento. Few mothers, almost exclusively those of older babies, were found (37.1%). Of those found, 92% were located within 3 days of abandoning their baby.\n\nCurrent social economic factors could be at play. \"I think we are living in a society where yes, there are difficulties with cost of living, there are difficulties with housing,\" she explained. \"Since Brexit, it's been more of a hostile environment towards immigrants.\n\n\"There are very limited resources for health, social care, housing and I think it's quite possible that there's an element of shame or fear. I think that we're looking at somebody who's going to be vulnerable on multiple fronts, psychologically and socially,\" the expert claimed.\n\nSpeaking specifically about the heartbreaking conditions baby Elsa was left in, the expert added: \"One must have been in a desperate situation to go through with that.\"\n\nDr Mueller also stated the importance of not forgetting about the role the father played in the abandonment. \"We don't know whether he's also in a desperate situation, was he complicit in the decision to do this?\" she said. \"We don't know whether the father is completely absent and we don't know whether the father could be in some way perpetrating the kind of repeated pregnancy.\"\n\nThe fact that parents often go without being identified suggests they are living off-grid, Dr Mueller said. \"If a baby was born in a hospital, there would be a record,\" she explained. \"If parents are known to social services, if a mother's known to be pregnant, there would be a follow-up there.\n\n\"It's really quite difficult to have carried a baby to term, giving birth and then to abandon it without anybody knowing about any of these things, that is really, really unusual and really dangerous.\" The expert, who provides psychological support for parents with her business, has raised concern about the trauma the parents of these three abandoned babies will be experiencing.\n\n\"It's not only a burden of losing multiple children, but it's the fact that it's a secret as well,\" she continued. \"We know that having things a secret increases complex grief symptoms of trauma. It's going to likely be very, very hard for them. The mental health and social situation of somebody who's abandoned three babies... one really wonders what's happening there and what could help this mother?\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk",

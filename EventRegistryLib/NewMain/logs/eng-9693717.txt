Sizwe Ntshangase, representing Sifiso Hlanti, has provided exclusive details. Regarding the surprising departure of the seasoned left-back from Chiefs earlier this week.\n\nAmakhosi made the unexpected decision not to extend Hlanti's contract, which officially expired on June 30, 2024. This decision also impacts Siyethemba Sithebe and Keagan Dolly, both of whom have contracts expiring at the end of June, marking a significant shake-up within the squad.\n\nDespite featuring prominently as the left-back for Chiefs in the recent DStv Premiership season, playing in 24 matches and scoring one goal. Hlanti will now be seeking a new club for the new season. Over his three seasons with the Soweto giants, he accumulated a total of 62 appearances and scored four goals. Establishing himself as a reliable presence on the field of play.\n\nThe decision to release Hlanti forms part of the strategic restructuring under newly appointed head coach Nasreddine Nabi. The club has swiftly moved to integrate new faces in the coaching staff. Which included assistant coach Fernando Da Cruz, who is actively leading the pre-season preparations alongside strength and conditioning coach Majdi Safi and goalkeeper coach Ilyes Mzoughi.\n\nIn an interview with Metro FM, Ntshangase expressed dissatisfaction with the communication process surrounding Hlanti's future at the club:\n\n\"We engaged with the club to understand their plans for Hlanti, but unfortunately, we did not receive clear communication,\" Ntshangase stated.\n\n\"While the club acknowledged his contributions during the last week of the season, they indicated that they would await the assessment of the new coach before making a final decision.\"\n\nHighlighting the lack of direct communication, Ntshangase revealed that Kaizer Chiefs informed Hlanti directly about their decision:\n\n\"Chiefs did not inform me directly about their decision not to renew Hlanti's contract. They mentioned that the new coach would assess him. But Hlanti was not afforded an opportunity to train or engage with any member of the new technical team when they communicated their decision to him earlier this week.\"\n\nKaizer Chiefs favourite Sifiso Hlanti's departure from Naturena underscores a pivotal moment amidst the club's strategic overhaul under Nasreddine Nabi's leadership. With concerns raised over the transparency of communication. Fans and stakeholders alike will closely monitor the club's future decisions regarding player contracts and squad dynamics.\n\nUltimately everyone wants to know who will replace Hlanti?", "source": {"uri": "thesouthafrican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The South African"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_hendricks@thesouthafrican.com", "name": "Joshua Hendricks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifiso_Hlanti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sifiso Hlanti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizer_Chiefs_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaizer Chiefs F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siyethemba_Sithebe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siyethemba Sithebe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keagan_Dolly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keagan Dolly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Town Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellenbosch"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stellenbosch"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Premier_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South African Premier Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soweto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soweto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Soweto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.thesouthafrican.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Chiefs.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693717", "eventUri": "eng-9693717", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Brendan Kuty and Katie Woo of The Athletic reported the news on Wednesday.\n\nMore news: Boston Red Sox Star Bows Out of MLB All-Star Game\n\nMayza, 32, was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays on June 29. He cleared waivers and was released by the team. Now, less than a week later, he's found his next home right back in the American League East.\n\nMayza was drafted in the 12th round of the 2013 MLB Draft by the Blue Jays. He's spent his entire career in the Toronto organization and debuted in Major League Baseball in 2017.\n\nMayza is coming off three consecutive dominant seasons in 2021, 2022, and 2023. The best season of his career came in 2023 when he had a 1.52 ERA in 69 relief appearances. However, this year, the wheels have come off for Mayza.\n\nMayza made 35 appearances for Toronto, allowing 22 earned runs in 24.2 innings of work. He had an ERA of 8.03 and a WHIP of 1.95, and the Blue Jays officially gave up on him in late June.\n\nMayza will now head to the Yankees' organization where he'll hope to turn his season around. The Yankees have had success this year in helping turn around the seasons of relievers, most notably Michael Tonkin.\n\nTonkin came to the Yankees this year after sporting a 6.00 ERA in nine innings pitched across the New York Mets and Minnesota Twins. Since joining the Yankees, Tonkin has a 1.60 ERA in 33.2 innings pitched.\n\nThe Yankees will hope for a similar midseason turnaround for Mayza as the one that Tonkin recently experienced. Mayza is a left-handed reliever, which is something the Yankees have shuffled through all season long.\n\nMayza has a career 3.87 ERA across 352 appearances, all as a reliever. He also has 292 strikeouts across his 283.2 innings pitched.\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone was asked about Mayza on Wednesday before the team's game against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\n\"Pretty good track record,\" Boone said, via Gary Phillips of the New York Daily News. \"It's been a tough year for him obviously... but he's been a guy that's performed really well in the AL East. He's been one of their trusted guys in Toronto for the last several years.\"\n\nMayza also happened to be the pitcher that Aaron Judge hit his record-breaking 61st home run of the 2022 season against:", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@newsweek.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Mayza", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Mayza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Boone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Boone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425952/tim-mayza.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=507e164e45761c0f7d961bbb83fed2d7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721932", "eventUri": "eng-9721932", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 309}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

For now, he's expected to report to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nBut he does have a distinct connection with the Yankees.\n\nIn 2022, at Toronto, Mayza served up Aaron Judge's AL record-tying 61st home run, in an historic season where the Yankees captain would hit 62, breaking Roger Maris' previous mark.\n\nThe last time the Yankees saw Mayza, they essentially ended his Blue Jays career. On June 28, Mayza was charged with five earned runs - including a two-run single by Judge - without recording an out in a 16-5 Yanks win.\n\nIn 35 appearances this year, Mayza has an 8.03 ERA with a 1.946 WHIP and 16 strikeouts vs. 12 walks in 24.2 innings.\n\nLast season, Mayza, 32, pitched to a 1.52 ERA in 69 games with 53 strikeouts and a 1.219 WHIP in 53.1 innings.\n\nOur preview: Who do spiraling Yankees need to target at 2024 trade deadline?\n\nCurrently, the Yankees have lefties Tim Hill, Caleb Ferguson and Josh Maciejewski in their bullpen. Lefty Victor Gonzalez was designated for assignment last month but returned to the organization and is pitching at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\nAhead of the July 30 MLB trade deadline, the Yankees have been linked to interest in Miami Marlins lefty closer Tanner Scott, a popular target among several contenders and a prime trade candidate in his free agent walk year, posting a 1.42 ERA and 1.079 WHIP in 37 games through Tuesday.\n\nHaving lost 16 of their last 21 games entering Wednesday, the Yankees have received subpar production by the starting rotation and the lineup, but they've also struggled in the bullpen with injuries and spotty performances.\n\nThe balance of Mayza's $3.59 million contract is covered by the Blue Jays.

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Two years ago, left-handed reliever Tim Mayza gave up the 61st home run of Aaron Judge's record-setting season.\n\nJudge pulled his full-count sinker on September 28, 2022, into the Blue Jays' bullpen in left field at Rogers Centre to make history.\n\nNow, Mayza is one call away from being Judge's teammate with the Yankees.\n\nThe reliever has signed a minor-league deal with the Yankees, per Brendan Kuty and Katie Woo of the Athletic.\n\nMayza, 32, was recently released by the Blue Jays after more than a decade within Toronto's organization. Late last month, he was designated for assignment by the Jays, passing through waivers.\n\nThis has been the worst season of Mayza's seven-year MLB career and it's not particularly close.\n\nMayza has a ghastly 8.03 ERA over 35 relief appearances in 2024. It's a significant regression from last year, a career-best season in which the southpaw posted a 1.52 ERA over a career-high 69 games.\n\nSome of his metrics in that season were spectacular, so it makes sense why the Yankees would want to take a shot at helping the left-hander recapture that form. Mayza had a 58.2 ground-ball rate in 2023, tied for the 10th-highest mark among all qualified relievers, per FanGraphs. He was avoiding hard contact at an elite rate (4.1 barrel % and 87.3 average exit velocity) with a top-10 sinker in MLB according to Statcast's run value.\n\nOdds are, Mayza will report to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, a new reclamation project for a team that has a track record of bringing the best out of pitchers that other teams put on the scrap heap.\n\nWhile Mayza faces an uphill battle to make it back to the big leagues this season, there's a chance he could fit in the Yankees' big-league bullpen. Other than sidearmer Tim Hill -- who has impressed since the Yankees picked him up last month -- the Yankees don't have any reliable lefty relievers.\n\nVictor Gonz\u00e1lez was designated for assignment earlier this season, sticking around within the org in Triple-A. Caleb Ferguson has a team-worst 5.46 ERA. Lefties Josh Maciejewski is currently on the big-league roster, but he's more of an inning-eater that'll end up on the chopping block once the Yankees need a fresh arm.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Mayza", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Mayza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hill_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hill (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gio_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gio Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton/Wilkes-Barre_RailRiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilkes-Barre RailRiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/PGP3S64AZZARPENJQGJM7XRYYA.jpg?auth=3d15b9d71f661daade95f528087226eaebc14bf09d4c7570e64cbfd2f4890b91&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721932", "eventUri": "eng-9721932", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jamie Sabau-USA TODAY Sports / Jamie Sabau-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Yankees made a move on Wednesday to add needed bullpen depth.\n\nNew York has struggled lately and one reason why for the recent cold streak is the bullpen hasn't been as good as expected. The Yankees have dealt with a plethora of injuries and haven't been at full strength.\n\nThe Yankees made a move on Wednesday to add depth by reportedly signing former Toronto Blue Jays hurler Tim Mayza, according to The Athletic's Brendan Kuty and Katie Woo.\n\n\"The New York Yankees have signed left-handed reliever Tim Mayza to a minor-league deal, sources tell The Athletic's Katie Woo and Brendan Kuty,\" Woo and Kuty said. \"The Toronto Blue Jays had designated the 32-year-old for assignment on June 29. He cleared waivers and the team released him on July 5.\n\n\"Mayza had an 8.03 ERA in 24 2/3 innings this season, and the average velocity on his sinker has steadily dropped from 2021 (94 mph) to now (91.9 mph).\"\n\nThe 32-year-old's numbers haven't been great this season with an 8.03 ERA in 35 innings pitched, but he still is worth taking a flier on. He spent seven seasons with the Blue Jays and at times has been a very solid reliever.\n\nIn 2022, he logged an impressive 1.52 ERA and 53-to15 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 53 1/3 innings pitched in 69 total appearances.\n\nHe has a 3.87 career ERA and if the Yankees can get him back on track, he could be a solid option to add bullpen depth with upside.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Mayza", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Mayza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout-to-walk_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout-to-walk ratio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7511,h_4224,x_0,y_112/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_pinstripes/01j2enneesq3h6nf8f35.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721932", "eventUri": "eng-9721932", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 918, "textEnd": 925}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 975, "textEnd": 981}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The lefty will presumably be assigned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre shortly.\n\nMayza, 32, was recently released by the Blue Jays as he's had an awful season thus far. He made 35 appearances for the Jays, logging 24 2/3 innings with 8.03 earned runs allowed per nine. His 9.9% walk rate on the year is passable but he has only struck out 13.2% of batters faced and his ground ball rate has been subpar at 39.1%.\n\nDespite the recent struggles, it's easy to see why the Yanks would be interested. Mayza underwent Tommy John surgery late in 2019 and missed all of 2020, but has was quite good between that absence and this year's dip. Over the 2021-23 period, he made 193 appearances for the Jays with a 2.67 ERA, 24.9% strikeout rate, 6.3% walk rate and 58.3% ground ball rate. He earned four saves and 56 holds for the Jays in that time.\n\nAll those numbers have moved in the wrong direction here in 2024, but there are reasons to suspect he's not been as bad as an 8.03 ERA would suggest. His .367 batting average on balls in play and 54.8% strand rate have both been on the unfortunate side of average, which is why his 4.91 FIP and 5.08 SIERA paint a rosier picture of his work this year. The lack of strikeouts and ground balls this year undoubtedly exacerbated that bad luck a bit, but expecting some better results going forward is within reason.\n\nThe Yanks have been trying to solve the left-handed relief portion of their roster this season. Victor Gonz\u00e1lez was recently bounced off the roster after some shaky outings. Caleb Ferguson has held onto his spot despite a 5.46 ERA this year. They recently bought low on veteran groundballer Tim Hill and have also given limited looks to Anthony Misiewicz and Josh Maciejewski.\n\nIf Mayza can turn a corner and show that the first half of 2024 was just a bad stretch, there's a path for him to get into that mix. The Yanks can get an up-close look at him for the next few weeks while they also assess who could be available on the trade market prior to the July 30 deadline.\n\nMayza is making $3.59MM this year but the Jays are on the hook for that since they released him. If the Yanks add him to the roster at any point, they would only have to pay him the prorated version of the league minimum for any time Mayza spends on the roster, with that amount subtracted from what the Jays pay. Mayza crossed over five years of service time earlier this year and can no longer be optioned to the minors, but if he gets a 40-man roster spot at some point, he can be retained via arbitration for the 2025 season.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darragh_mcdonald@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Darragh McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Mayza", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Mayza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton/Wilkes-Barre_RailRiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilkes-Barre RailRiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Misiewicz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Misiewicz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hill_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hill (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gio_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gio Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai/Frontons", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai/Frontons", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2024/07/USATSI_22994118-1024x659.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721932", "eventUri": "eng-9721932", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2151, "textEnd": 2158}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

In contrast, over 53.1 innings in 2023, Mayza was still at the top of his game, enjoying a 1.52 ERA, including 8.94 strikeouts per nine, an 88.4% left-on-base rate, and a 58.2% ground ball rate.\n\nThe Bombers are hoping that they can extract any remaining value from Mayza, who has seen his walks per nine double this season and his ground ball rate plummet nearly 20%.\n\nMayza ranks in the 1st percentile in both expected ERA and expected batting average, not to mention the 2nd percentile in whiff rate and strike-out rate. He's one of the worst pitchers in baseball based on those numbers, but the Yankees may want to slightly tweak his pitch usage. This year, he's seen a 6% decrease in sinker usage and a 6% increase in his slider usage. Opposing batters are demolishing his sinker, which has dropped 1.5 mph in velocity. His slider has maintained its shape for the most part, but it's not getting the same deviation, with his sinker simply ineffective.\n\nDespite the significant drop in velocity, Mayza's sinker is still producing similar movement. In fact, it has 1 inch more vertical drop and is within the margins of his career averages with a horizontal break. If he can boost his velocity even slightly, he might be able to turn back the clock and offer the Yankees value at a cheap price.\n\nThe Yankees can't lean on deals like this to get them over the hump long-term, but they're finding stash moves to reinforce the bullpen when they need support. Instead, eyeing a dominant arm at the trade deadline in late July could be a more productive move.

From K-pop groups topping global charts to \"Squid Game\" being the most streamed show on Netflix within one month of being released, the audience for Korean media has grown far beyond its country of origin. Throughout the 21st century, the \"Korean wave\" has made South Korea a pop culture powerhouse.\n\nThe origins of \"Hallyu\"\n\nThe rapid growth of Korean media is closely intertwined with the country's changing political landscape in the late 20th century. With the end of military censorship, the ensuing boom in the Korean entertainment industry helped its economy recover from post-war hardships. The 1997 Asian economic crisis led the Korean government to invest in the Internet and cultural exports, first finding a market in nearby Asian countries. In fact, the word \"hallyu\" (which translates to \"Korean wave\") originates from China, one of the first countries where Korean media found an audience.\n\nThe rise of South Korea's most prominent broadcast and music agencies occurred alongside increasingly widespread use of the Internet, bringing Korean media from East Asia to around the world. Additionally, the Korean government encouraged globalization by lifting restrictions on international trade and promoting cultural development. Foreign interest in Korean products was on a steady climb -- until one song catapulted Korea onto the global pop culture stage.\n\nHow \"Gangnam Style\" launched Korean media worldwide\n\nWhen most people think of K-pop or even Korea itself, they think of Psy's \"Gangnam Style.\" The song was released in 2012, and with a simple yet catchy chorus and dance that transcended language barriers, it became a viral hit. It hit number two -- the highest place a Korean artist had achieved at the time -- on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the first music video to reach one billion views on YouTube.\n\n\"Gangnam Style\" opened the door for other K-pop acts to gain global fame throughout the 2010s. Despite the cultural differences between Asian idol culture and Western stardom, K-pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink have found loyal fanbases worldwide. K-pop as a genre has also globalized, with Korean artists collaborating with non-Korean musicians and more English lyrics in K-pop songs. BTS's \"Dynamite,\" the group's first song entirely in English, received international recognition including a Grammy nomination.\n\nAlongside the rise of K-pop internationally, Korean TV shows and films also gained worldwide viewership. While K-dramas were part of the first \"hallyu\" in other Asian countries during the early 2000s, they took off globally in the mid-2010s after Netflix partnered with major Korean television companies. Netflix also started producing its own Korean content in response to the demand for K-dramas on their platform. The most well-known Korean show is Netflix's 2021 original \"Squid Game.\" With its central premise of playing childhood games in a dystopian life-or-death competition, it quickly became Netflix's most watched series.\n\nIn contrast to the Korean music industry centering around idol groups, a wide variety of genres in Korean shows and movies have found international success. A hallmark of Korean film is Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite,\" a thriller about two socially unequal families that became the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Korea's unique interpretations of certain genres also appeals to global audiences. For instance, zombie media such as \"Kingdom,\" \"Train to Busan\" and \"Sweet Home\" offer their own spin on a common trope that have hooked viewers. Other popular genres of Korean TV and film include romance, historical period pieces and variety shows.\n\nThe impact of Korea's pop culture boom\n\nThe popularity of Korean media has bolstered not just the country's economy, but its global image as a whole. For some, Korean pop culture has inspired them to learn more about the country. A steadily increasing number of American students are studying Korean, and South Korea is one of the most sought-out locations to study abroad.\n\nNot only is Korean entertainment enjoyed globally, but it has brought tourists to South Korea. The number of tourists in South Korea has spiked from five million in 2000 to 17.5 million in 2019. Recognizing foreigners' interest in pop culture, the Korean tourism industry promotes \"K-culture\" hotspots such as K-pop concerts and trendy shopping districts. In 2017, BTS were given the role of Honorary Tourism Ambassador of Seoul, the largest city in South Korea. However, you don't have to travel to Korea to see its cultural power in action.

But there was a need, a gap in literature, to examine K-pop fans and their labor more closely, specifically K-pop fans in Korea.\"\n\nAnd who better to fill the gap than a superfan?\n\nWhen she stumbled upon the job posting related to Korean culture and literature at ASU, she felt it was a perfect fit. \"I was very excited because I could see where I could contribute with research and my teaching, and I could help the (Korean) program grow.\"\n\nJeong's research largely looks at Korean film, popular culture, theater and performance. She is currently working on a book exploring how the labor of K-pop fans is not only shaping the industry's global popularity, but also K-pop's cultural and social impacts.\n\n\"The School of International Letters and Cultures prides itself on its breadth, from teaching languages and cultures to subjects as old as the Hebrew Bible, Caesar and the Quran, or as new as soccer, anime and the latest international films,\" said Mike Tueller, the school's director. \"Professor Jeong opens a new gateway into a fascinating culture, and I'm excited to have her here at ASU.\"\n\nOver the past decade, Hallyu, or the growing influence of Korean culture around the world, has become more evident in all forms of media. \"I noticed that after BTS's explosive popularity, there were a lot more students who were interested in studying Korean pop culture,\" Jeong said.\n\nIn 2023, Netflix announced it would invest $2.5 billion to create Korean films and shows for its platform. And in the same year, 19 of the top 20 selling albums were by K-pop groups, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.\n\nRecognizing the high educational value in offering students more opportunities to learn about diverse cultures and comparative viewpoints, Jeong introduced two new courses.\n\nThis spring, she launched KOR/SIC 415: Korean Popular Culture, which had an emphasis on K-pop. In the fall, KOR 394/SLC 394: Korean Film Directors, will focus on three prominent film directors.\n\nVideo courtesy The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences\n\n\"The class has been so incredibly informative and fun,\" said animation senior Cheryl Brangaccio, who fell in love with BTS in 2016.\n\nThe class, which will return in spring 2025, explored the history of Korean pop culture and its evolution from the 90s to today. Students also learned to examine the industry's new social impacts related to politics, gender, race and sexuality.\n\n\"I think anyone can find something to enjoy in the class, regardless of their view on what K-pop is and how their fans are. I haven't had so much fun in a humanities class until now, and had a chance to make new friends,\" Brangaccio said.\n\nNow, Jeong is excited for her fall course on Bong Joon-ho, Kim Jee-woon and Park Chan-wook.\n\n\"I view them as the pillars of new Korean cinema,\" Jeong said. \"Their craft is what helped develop Korean film into what it looks like today.\"\n\nHowever, the coursework is very male dominated because \"there are very little opportunities for women filmmakers in Korea to climb up the ladder,\" she explained. But Jeong is hopeful that the film industry will evolve to be more inclusive of women.\n\n\"I want students to see how the idea of Korean-ness is not some kind of fixed, unchanging idea, but rather it's always shifting, just like K-pop.

Courtesy of SBS\n\nBy Luna Sun\n\nKorean reality shows have long fascinated global audiences with their inventive content.\n\nThe latest to capture the hearts of Chinese viewers is \"My Sibling's Romance,\" which premiered in early March. The innovative dating program introduces a fresh twist to the reality dating show genre by featuring brother-sister pairs navigating the quest for love while observing their sibling's romantic endeavors.\n\nTwo months in, the fervor continues unabated on the Chinese internet, where Korean variety shows have garnered a dedicated fan base. Once again, Korean variety show producers have left Chinese fans in awe with their ability to breathe new life into familiar themes. And it is precisely the constant innovation and creativity that captivate Chinese fans.\n\nThe enduring popularity of Korean variety shows in China has also prompted a deeper inquiry into the cultural exchange between the two countries and the profound impact it holds on fostering mutual understanding and appreciation.\n\nJane Wan, a strategic manager at a marketing company in Shanghai, has been a fan of Korean reality shows since she was in middle school starting with the popular game show \"X-Man,\" which aired from 2003 to 2007.\n\nThese variety shows \"each have their own different charm,\" she said.\n\nTake Wan's favorite dating shows for example.\n\n\"'My Sibling's Romance' portrays heartwarming sibling bonds, while 'EXchange' delves into the intricacies of past relationships and new romances and 'Love Catcher' examines the dynamics of love and financial choices,\" she said.\n\nOver the years, she has watched a wide range of classic and new shows, including \"Running Man,\" \"Strong Heart,\" \"Ya Shim Man Man,\" \"Super Junior's Super TV,\" \"Home Alone,\" \"Saturday Night Live Korea\" and \"Let's Eat Dinner Together,\" among many others.\n\nShe is also a big fan of Na Young-seok, one of the most famous Korean television producers in China. His work, including \"2 Days & 1 Night,\" \"New Journey to the West,\" \"Three Meals a Day\" and \"Youn's Kitchen,\" among others, all enjoy immense popularity among Chinese fans.\n\nKorean television producer Na Young-seok gained immense popularity in China for the variety programs he was behind. Courtesy of CJ ENM\n\nJamie Chu, a 30-year-old working at a marketing firm in Beijing who also enjoys producer Na's travel and slow living shows such as \"Three Meals a Day,\" praised the emotional depth Korean variety shows bring.\n\n\"These variety shows allow me to observe different people's genuine reactions in various situations, offering a fascinating opportunity to observe the beauty of humanity,\" she said. \"They also amplify life's precious moments, leaving me feeling healed, moved or simply joyful, nostalgic and sometimes even enamored along with the guests.\"\n\nChu has been watching Korean variety shows for nearly two decades since the Korea variety show \"Love Letter\" was introduced to China about two decades ago, through which she started her long love for K-pop and Korean culture.\n\nAmong popular stars of Korean variety shows, she highlighted how singer-turned-entertainer Kim Jong-kook diligently maintains his fitness routine to uphold his image for variety shows.\n\n\"Each entertainer is very committed to creating a variety show personality much like molding a movie character. I find this level of dedication very captivating,\" Chu said.\n\nThe innovative game formats and filming techniques in Korean variety shows and how Korean producers \"are able to turn every aspect of life into entertainment shows\" attracted her and other fans alike.\n\n\"My all-time favorite Korean variety show used to be 'We Got Married.' I must have watched my favorite couple's episodes about 10 times and every winter, I find myself rewatching them,\"she said.\n\nAs an NCT Dream fan, she also watches \"7llin in the Dream\" and \"7llin in Our Youth,\" reality show starring the members of NCT Dream as a channel for getting a glimpse of her favorite idols' personalities outside of their stage performances, which provide her with a lot of companionship and comfort.\n\n\"For example, when I'm at work, taking a five-minute break to watch a compilation of clips while in the restroom stall can instantly recharge my energy and give me the motivation to face life head-on.\"\n\nThanks to her interest in Korean variety shows, Chu is also taking Korean lessons.\n\nDating show \"My Sibling's Romance\" has captivated Chinese audiences with its fresh format. Courtesy of JTBC and Wavve\n\nMany Chinese fans are captivated by the laid-back atmosphere and vibrant sense of humor prevalent in Korean variety shows. For them, Korean reality programs epitomize captivating themes, abundant laughter and unparalleled production values, both in terms of music and visuals.\n\nShi Xiangyu, a 28-year-old originally from Beijing, said her interest in Korean variety shows started around 2013 with \"Running Man,\" which was one of the most famous Korean reality shows in China, boosted by the Chinese remake version.\n\n\"'Running Man' and 'Infinite Challenge' have undoubtedly brought me a lot of joy as my introduction to Korean variety shows,\" she said.\n\n\"Along with the laughter, as these programs began to delve into the real-life experiences and personal journeys of their regular cast members, they have traversed different stages of life, simultaneously bridging the distance and becoming a habitual companion in my life.\"\n\n\"Witnessing the camaraderie among the cast members, their mutual care (for one another), has also brought me much encouragement and emotion.\"\n\nShe even made friends with fellow enthusiasts when \"Running Man\" held fan meetings in Shanghai and Beijing. \"It felt like we all shared the same appreciation for the show and were moved by the same moments. It was a simple, pure joy,\" she recalled.\n\nShe added that she used to spend nearly 10 hours watching Korean variety shows each week during her college years without missing a single episode of \"Running Man,\" but now with work, she still unwinds by watching popular Korean variety shows occasionally during dinner or on free nights when she doesn't need to work late.\n\nKorean variety shows also sparked her keen interest in Korean culinary culture and traveling to Korea, Shi said.\n\nThe popularity of these shows has led to numerous Chinese adaptations, including \"We Got Married,\" with its Chinese version \"We Are In Love\"; cooking variety program \"Please Take Care of My Refrigerator,\" also known as \"Chef & My Fridge\"; and \"Dad! Where Are We Going?\" -- the Korean reality show where celebrity fathers and their children go on trips together, which cater to local tastes while maintaining the original charm of their Korean counterparts.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_Man_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running Man (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Variety show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na_Yeong-seok", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Na Yeong-seok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chu (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_variety_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean variety show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_(South_Korean_singer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luna (South Korean singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Meals_a_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Meals a Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Man_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Man (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Junior's_Super_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Junior's Super TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Eat_Dinner_Together", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Let's Eat Dinner Together"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youn's_Kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youn's Kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCT_Dream", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCT Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Journey_to_the_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Journey to the West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culture of Korea"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JTBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK_Telecom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SK Telecom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/6ec19920cc5e459083d0e835db859973.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555097", "eventUri": "eng-9555097", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

May. 10, 2024 07:40. .\n\nSouth Korean businesses, despite the challenging geopolitical landscape, are demonstrating remarkable resilience and adaptability.\n\nSouth Korean and Chinese business leaders held a meeting at Walkerhill Hotel in Seoul last December for the first time in four years. Across the table were SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won, who leads the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Hyundai Motor Group Chair Chung Eui-sun, and Samsung Electronics President Park Seung-hee, who were accompanied by Chinese business moguls in energy, petrochemistry, and bio industries. All the business leaders engaged in discussion in a lighthearted mood as they were joined by former South Korean government officials such as former deputy prime minister and minister of finance Yoo Il-ho; former minister of health and welfare Rim Chae-min; and former chief FTA negotiator Choi Seok-young. Indeed, this provided a buffer zone during the talks between C-level corporate representatives from South Korea and China; and former high-ranking government leaders.\n\nIt was part of normal business practice for South Korean companies, which have both production hubs and consumers in China, to occasionally meet up to promote cooperation up until tensions started growing between China and the United States. Given how China works, they invested a great deal of time in building social networks not only with their business partners but also with China's central and local government authorities. However, after a set of new U.S. sanctions on China turned things around back in 2018, South Korean companies found it harder to visit China when they encountered some issues with business deals and production lines they should get right. They were only limited to low-profile, small-sized trips.\n\nIt was reported that South Korean and Chinese business leaders enjoyed a productive and fruitful time at a late-night drinking party as part of the gathering for the first time in four years. They all had a heart-to-heart chat over drinks for the first time in a long time, sharing their viewpoints on business issues and investment plans.\n\nWith Washington and China at odds with each other for quite a long time, South Korean companies are seeing the consequences of their sour relations. As U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has continuously argued for export controls of chip equipment to China, it is not U.S. equipment firms but South Korean makers that lost a considerable portion of the Chinese market. To be specific, the amount of import costs China spent on South Korean chip equipment dropped by 20.3 percent as of last year compared to the year earlier; the corresponding figure for U.S. chip equipment only decreased by 3.1 percent during the same period. By contrast, China recorded an increase in imports from the Netherlands and Japan by 150.6 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.\n\nWith the damage done unknowingly to South Korean businesses, the Semiconductor Industry Association, a group of U.S. chip companies, jointly opposed the U.S. government's sanctions on China last July, arguing that the semiconductor sector needs to maintain its access to Chinese clients. In March, Apple CEO Tim Cook, concerned about the marked drop in sales in the Chinese market, flew to China to talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Additionally, he opened the door at Apple's newest store in Shanghai on its opening day.\n\nCompared to their U.S. competitors, South Korean businesses seem to have less room for maneuvering, sandwiched between Washington and Beijing, even while the market they have painstakingly built around is closing its door with their hands tied. They desperately wait for Seoul to facilitate diplomatic communication channels. This all explains the high expectations for the upcoming summit talk among South Korea, China, and Japan, which will likely occur by the end of this month. Given that the three governments will also have a ministerial meeting regarding economic affairs and commerce for the first time in four years since December 2019, Seoul is highly expected to take a \"frenemy\" approach over the talks. Just as Washington takes an offensive posture at the forefront but gives a leg up to businesses behind the scenes, Seoul needs to ensure that South Korean companies get a chance at least to take a relieving breath in the upcoming talks.", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea",

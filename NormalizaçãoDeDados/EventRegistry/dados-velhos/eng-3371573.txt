Robert Scheer/IndyStar\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nFrieden Johnson, in a petite, jewel-colored dress and purple Birkenstocks, peered up at Tim, in matching purple with a gem-encrusted yarmulke, with a look of absolute awe and love.\n\nThe couple's officiant, the Very Vocal Viking, asked them to repeat vows after him.\n\n\"I promise to love you, with all my heart, for all my days, you scruffy Nerf Herder,\" they recited. \"I promise to protect you with my Patronus, and help you hide from He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named and help you make fun of muggles.\"\n\nThe ceremony on the field of Lucas Oil Stadium took place Thursday, the first day of Gen Con's 50th anniversary. By the time their vows were done, the Very Vocal Viking, also known as Troy Maynard, had evoked references from Zelda, \"The Princess Bride,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Dr. Who,\" \"Harry Potter,\" \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Incredible Hulk.\"\n\n\"By the power vested in me by Gen Con LLC and the spirit of gaming infused in this most holy of gaming spaces, I now pronounce you partners in life and love,\" Maynard said. \"May no power in the 'verse ever separate you.\"\n\nTim leaned over and kissed his bride. The two have been legally married for two years, but didn't have a formal ceremony because, \"I was super pregnant,\" Frieden said, laughing.\n\nShe surprised Tim with the plans to re-marry, though not technically a legally binding ceremony, at Gen Con.\n\n\"We never had a wedding, so I thought it would be a fun surprise,\" she said. \"He found out about this about 11 minutes ago.\"\n\nTim only knew he had to dress up. \"I was very surprised,\" he said, but thought it was the perfect setting. \"We love being here.\"\n\nThe two won't be the only ceremony Maynard, who lives in Bloomington, officiates at Gen Con. He's doing two to three vow renewals and weddings daily. The 10-minute ceremony is mostly the same, though he'll alter the vows or add something depending on a couple's religious preferences.\n\n\"It's whatever they want it to be,\" he said. \"The majority of the people met here at Gen Con or they just love coming to Gen Con.\"\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Amy Bartner at (317) 444-6752.

(Just as the \"wave\" ironically contrasts with non-sports stereotypes associated with gamers).\n\nConcert recap: Green Day show sends good vibes to nearly everyone\n\nExplore Indy: 14 amazingly nerdy places in the Circle City\n\nQuiz time: As Gen Con turns 50, how much do you know about it?\n\nFlansburgh and his TMBG co-founder, vocalist-keyboard player John Linnell, are only 15 years behind Gen Con in terms of longevity. The band's trademark approach of matching quirky lyrics to surf music, garage rock and baroque pop connected with the estimated audience of 6,000 -- but it took a few songs for everyone to get comfortable.\n\n\"It's so weird playing a place this big,\" said Flansburgh, who also referred to Bankers Life Fieldhouse as \"corporate dome.\"\n\nAbout seven songs into the show, band and audience loosened up during a rendition of \"The Guitar,\" a 1992 song that includes altered DNA of \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight.\" After Flansburgh encouraged people seated on the sides to stand up and come closer, a lengthy conga line snaked its way across the arena floor.\n\nLinnell and Flansburgh admitted to knowing little about Gen Con, the convention that's bringing more than 60,000 card-game, board-game and role-playing enthusiasts to Indianapolis through Sunday.\n\n\"We're so old we remember when dungeons and dragons were separate genres,\" Linnell said, making a valiant stab at a timely and topical joke.\n\nIt's safe to say there's a Venn-diagram intersection between what gamers enjoy and what Linnell and Flansburgh write songs about.\n\n\"We don't want to get political, so we just stick to the facts,\" Flansburgh said when introducing one of a handful of songs devoted to science.\n\nCrowd members heard \"Why Does the Sun Shine? (The Sun Is a Mass of Incandescent Gas),\" \"Particle Man\" and \"Robot Parade.\"\n\nThe lyrics of \"Meet the Elements\" inform that \"plants, bugs, birds, fish, bacteria and men are mostly carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.\"\n\nHey, it's #TheyMightBeGiants playing \"Don't Let's Start\" in an NBA arena! #GenCon50pic.twitter.com/WKElK4Arxt -- Dave Lindquist (@317lindquist)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nMusically, guitarist Dan Miller provided expert accompaniment to two-time Grammy Award winners Linnell and Flansburgh. They introduced Miller to the audience about a dozen times during the show, and he deserved the attention.\n\nLyrically, Linnell has a knack for zeroing in on the existential amid the laughs.\n\nOn the gleefully negative \"When Will You Die,\" he sang, \"On that promised morning we will wake and greet the dawn, knowing that your wicked life is over and that we will carry on.\"\n\nAnd \"Don't Let's Start,\" the duo's breakthrough single from 30 years ago, continues to sear the mind: \"No one in the world ever gets what they want and that is beautiful. Everybody dies frustrated and sad and that is beautiful.\"\n\nDespite Flansburgh's pledge regarding politics, he did refer to President Trump as a \"horrible person\" (one night after Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong accused Trump of being a \"white supremacist\" at Klipsch Music Center) when introducing TMBG's 1990 homage to the 11th U.S. president, \"James K. Polk.\"\n\nDownload the IndyStar Things To Do App\n\nCall IndyStar reporter David Lindquist at (317) 444-6404.

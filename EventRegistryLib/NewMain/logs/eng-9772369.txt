with the Real Madrid star closing in on taking over French side SM Caen.\n\nMbappe left French club football this summer when his Paris Saint-Germain contract expired last month.\n\nThe French superstar completed a free transfer to Real Madrid and was unveiled in front of 80,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabeu earlier this month.\n\nMbappe is expected to retain an interest in French domestic football with reports the striker is poised to complete a \u00a317m (\u20ac20m) deal to buy French second division side SM Caen.\n\nFrench newspaper Le Parisien reported that talks have been ongoing for several weeks, with an agreement expected to be concluded 'in the coming hours'.\n\nKylian Mbappe is reportedly in talks to buy a second division French club for around \u00a317million\n\nThe deal would reportedly see Mbappe buy out the American investment fund Oaktree Capital, which bought an 80 per cent stake in the club in 2020.\n\nMbappe would become the club's majority shareholder, with current supervisory board chairman Pierre Antoine Capton retaining his 20 per cent stake.\n\nOaktree Capital are expected to focus their efforts on Inter Milan after taking control of the club in May.\n\nShould Mbappe complete the deal, he would become the owner of the second tier French side at just 25.\n\nCaen scout David Lasry revealed in a BBC documentary that the club had come close to signing Mbappe when the forward was just 13.\n\nMbappe's father had reportedly confirmed they had agreed for their son to join the club, who are based in Normandy.\n\nThe deal, however, collapsed when Caen were relegated from Ligue 1 to the second tier in 2012.\n\nMbappe would instead join Monaco's academy, with the forward later breaking into the first-team set-up before joining PSG.\n\nMbappe is expected to become the owner of Caen with talks reportedly nearing a conclusion\n\nThe new Real Madrid signing had nearly joined Caen as a teenager back in 2012\n\nLe Parisien reported that Mbappe and his family have retained a good relationship with the Caen leading to a deal being pursued.\n\nMbappe and his mother Fayza Lamari reportedly plan to appoint Ziad Hammoud as president of the club when the takeover is completed.\n\nHammoud was previously the director of strategy and investments at the BeIN Media Group, and now oversees Mbappe's image company.\n\nReports in French claim Mbappe plans to maintain the club's identity, with a focus on developing young players.\n\nCaen finished fifth in Ligue 2 last season, with the club having last featured in the top flight of French football back in the 2018-19 campaign.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF",

The French football star has become the majority owner of Stade Malherbe Caen, a club in Ligue 2. This surprising move comes right after his big transfer from Paris Saint-Germain to Real Madrid. Mbappe, who is 25 years old, spent \u20ac20 million to buy an 80 percent stake in the Normandy-based club from American investors Oaktree.\n\nMbappe's story with Caen has a nostalgic twist. As a teenager, he almost joined the club but ended up at AS Monaco's academy instead. Now, more than ten years later, he is taking control of the team he once thought about joining. This makes him one of the youngest owners of a professional club in Europe. He will co-own Caen with Pierre-Antoine Capton, president of the club's supervisory board.\n\nEven though Mbappe will continue playing in Spain, he plans to manage Caen \"with moderation.\" He wants to keep the club's identity and be careful with his decisions. He aims to avoid the mistakes many new owners make. Since he will be busy with Real Madrid, he won't be in Normandy often. But his influence and ideas will still shape the club. Ziad Hammoud, the CEO of Mbappe's image company and a former strategy director at beIN Media Group, will become the club's president. This shows that Mbappe wants experienced leadership for Caen.\n\nMbappe's decision to invest in Caen is about more than money. He wants to help a club he has liked for years. His involvement could bring more attention and resources to the team, which might improve their performance and future.\n\nThe connection between Mbappe and Caen goes back to his youth. The club followed him closely when he was a young talent. They even offered him a trainee contract and a professional deal. But when Caen got relegated from Ligue 1 in the 2011/12 season, the deal fell through. Mbappe chose Monaco instead, where he started his professional career. Now, he is back with Caen in a different role, hoping to lead the club to success.\n\nThis takeover comes at an interesting time. Mbappe just left PSG, where he became the club's all-time top scorer, to join Real Madrid. His move to La Liga was one of the biggest stories of the summer. Now, his purchase of Caen adds another exciting chapter to his career.\n\nMbappe's move into club ownership at such a young age is unusual. It shows his ambition and forward-thinking. While his playing career is still going strong, he is already planning for his future. Being both a player and an owner makes him different from many of his peers.\n\nMoving from player to owner is tough, but Mbappe seems ready. He brings fresh ideas and a lot of experience from his playing days. He wants to keep Caen's spirit alive and make careful improvements.\n\nIn the end, Kylian Mbappe's purchase of Caen is a big new step in his career. It shows his strong connection to French football and his wish to make a lasting impact. As he continues to shine with Real Madrid, his work with Caen will be watched closely.

This development is particularly intriguing given Mbappe's history with the club.\n\nBack in 2013, a young Mbappe was on trial with Caen. At the time, he was a promising talent on the verge of breaking into professional football. However, Caen were struggling financially due to their recent relegation, and they couldn't afford to sign him.\n\nAs a result, Mbappe ended up joining AS Monaco, where he began his journey to becoming one of the world's top footballers.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and Mbappe has now acquired the majority of the shares in the very club that once missed out on his talents.\n\nThe deal, reported by French media, was closed at under \u20ac20 million to acquire 80% of the club.\n\nThe purchase was facilitated by Coalition Capital, an investment fund that manages all the Mbappe family's investments.\n\nAt just 25 years old, Mbappe will become the youngest owner in football history, taking over from Oaktree, an American investment firm.\n\nThe Mbappe family's plan to invest in a football club has been in the works for several months. Their goal is to see Caen, located in Normandy, promoted to Ligue 1 as soon as possible.\n\nAn interesting aspect of this acquisition is that it will be managed through KM7, a company run by Mbappe's mother, Fayza Lamari.\n\nThis move aligns with Mbappe's broader ambitions, which extend beyond his success on the field. He aims to make significant strides in football management and ownership, demonstrating his vision for a long-term impact on the sport.\n\nThis purchase marks a significant step for Mbappe, who has always been vocal about his aspirations to influence football beyond his playing career.\n\nBy investing in Stade Malherbe Caen, he is not only securing a financial stake in the game but also contributing to the growth and development of a club that once played a pivotal role in his early career.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Caen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Malherbe_Caen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Malherbe Caen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Le Parisien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6AcDh2RQ0ZGsw_3HzHakyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/madrid_universal_articles_561/6b04a97519de6fe7e681469020137124", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772369", "eventUri": "eng-9772369", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The signing of the French footballer made headlines all over the world. The football star is again making headlines after he became the youngest club owner in football. The 2018 World Cup winner, purchased a majority stake in Ligue 2 side Caen for around 20 Million Euros. Although it is common for footballers to invest in other clubs after they retire from the sport, Mbappe has started making considerable investments while playing.\n\nWhen Kylian Mbappe was a young prodigy and was up and coming as a footballer, Caen wanted to sign Mbappe and almost did. Due to Caen being relegated from Ligue 1, Mbappe then had to look for a different club. Now Mbappe as a owner will take over Caen and try and get them back to the highest division in France, Ligue 1. Mbappe will be the co-owner of the club along with Pierre-Antin Capon who will have his shares in the club worth 5 Million Euros and Mbappe will have for around 20 Million Euros.\n\nFans are yet to see Kylian Mbappe play in the Real Madrid jersey. As of right now Mbappe is set to miss the pre-season tour of Real Madrid that is taking place in the United States. Fans will get the first glimpse of Mbappe playing for Real Madrid on 15th August when Real Madrid will take on Atalanta in the UEFA Super Cup final which will be the first competitive fixture for the club during the new season. Mbappe has also taken a significant pay-cut when he joined Madrid as he will be earning around 15 Million Euros. Apart from this he will also be getting a signing bonus of 100 Million Euros which he will get through out his contract period.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Caen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/30/1453048-untitled-design-2024-07-30t124457.118.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772369", "eventUri": "eng-9772369", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 1414, "textEnd": 1425}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 24}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Star hints he will 'surely play' in UEFA Super Cup - CBSSports.com", "body": "The UEFA Cup kicks off the season for Europe's biggest competitions on August 14 Getty Images\n\nKylian Mbappe is now a Real Madrid player after years of speculation linking him with a move from Paris Saint-Germain to the Spanish giants. The France national team captain will be lining up as Los Blancos' new No. 9 for this coming season but the big question is already when we will first see him on the field in brilliant white. Because of an extended run at UEFA Euro 2024, Mbappe's first appearance for Carlo Ancelotti's side will be delayed but his first outing with the European and Spanish champions is still a few weeks away.\n\nSo, when could that be?\n\nWill we see Mbappe on Real's U.S. tour?\n\nThe simple answer is no. Mbappe has been introduced to the Real fans at Santiago Bernabeu but the Frenchman is not part of the squad for this summer's U.S. tour which got underway this weekend. Los Blancos will face Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea but the 25-year-old has not traveled so do not expect any change on that. Mbappe and France went all the way to the Euro 2024 semifinals after a long season and he is not even due back for the start of his preseason until 7 August along with fellow French teammates Aurelien Tchouameni, Ferland Mendy and Eduardo Camavinga. Real, Mbappe and Ancelotti came to the decision together with the ex-PSG attacker also nursing an injured nose post-Euro which requires recovery time.\n\nSo, it will be a competitive debut?\n\nYes, although the UEFA Super Cup to be. Even if there is a trophy available for the winner and it does pit the UEFA Champions League and Europa League titleholders against each other, it is often not considered a fully competitive fixture -- as is the case with many domestic Super Cup iterations. Real face Atalanta in Warsaw one full week after Mbappe's return to preseason training, so not only could his Real debut come in Poland, but it could also be marked with a first piece of continental club silverware of his career. Additionally, a Real win could see them become record six-time winners as they currently share that record with Barcelona and Milan. It is also when Mbappe himself expects to feature: \"I am in contact with the doctors and they will tell me when I return from my holiday. We have already spoken with (Real fitness chief) Antonio Pintus to design a preseason program. It is going to be a long season, we need special preparation. I spoke with the doctors and we will see what we will do and I will surely play in the Super Cup, but it depends on the coach. I am going to work to be ready.\"\n\nWhat about in La Liga?\n\nFour days after the UEFA Super Cup, Real start the domestic Spanish season away at Mallorca and that could also be a debut opportunity for Mbappe. Assuming he does feature in Warsaw, this could well be his full competitive debut, but the expectation is that he will at least feature in Poland against Atalanta so it could already be a question of when the Frenchman is ready to get 90 minutes under his belt by this point.\n\nAnd the UCL?\n\nThis one is not totally clear yet -- aside from the potential date. Real do not yet know what their new-look Champions League title defense group stage will look like given that this is the first season of the new UCL format. Qualification finishes at the end of August so Los Blancos' draw will only be made once that is all complete.\n\nCould he break any records?\n\nOne piece of European silverware from one appearance would pretty much sum up why Mbappe decided that now was the moment to swap PSG for Real. However, he is too old now to set landmarks such as being the youngest debutant or anything like his early years in France. Instead, the former AS Monaco man will have to target prolific achievements instead. For the record, Mbappe's PSG bow came in a 5-1 thrashing of FC Metz in Ligue 1 back in 2017 with a goal in that rout and he also found the net against Celtic in his UCL debut with Les Parisiens just a few days later.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_johnson@cbssports.com", "name": "Jonathan Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Super Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Camavinga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Camavinga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warsaw"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD_Mallorca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RCD Mallorca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Metz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Metz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS_Monaco_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AS Monaco FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/29/eee70de1-b238-4b6f-9540-15ce3c189b22/thumbnail/1200x675/7b8813b603870136a2da038f7f10ab52/untitled-design-2024-07-29t132503-758.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9772369", "eventUri": "eng-9772369", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1165, "textEnd": 1173}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 71, "textEnd": 80}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

targeting legend status", "body": "Kylian Mbappe has enjoyed huge success in his career so far, and it seems unlikely that this will change anytime soon.\n\nThe French star is undoubtedly one of the world's best, with Real Madrid's new Galactico recording some remarkable feats already at the age of just 25.\n\nSince bursting onto the scene as a 16-year-old to become Monaco's youngest ever player, Mbappe has continually proven himself on football's biggest stages.\n\nHaving completed a mouth-watering move to serial-winners Madrid, the rapid attacker now appears destined to add to his impressive 17 major honours.\n\nA world champion with his national side in 2018, and boasting the 2017 Golden Boy award among his long list of individual accolades, the Champions League title and Ballon d'Or are two notable absentees from Mbappe's trophy cabinet.\n\nWith Los Blancos known European specialists and a history of producing winners of football's ultimate individual award, the Frenchman will fancy his chances of capturing both before too long.\n\nHere is a full breakdown of his career record so far...\n\nIt didn't take long for Monaco to hand Mbappe his senior debut, bringing him on in a Ligue 1 match against Caen in December 2015 to make him the club's youngest ever first team player at 16 years, 347 days, a record previously held by Thierry Henry.\n\nIn just his second season in men's football, he helped Monaco to a first French title in 17 years, as his 15 league goals helped them to finish on top spot, eight points clear of routine victors PSG.\n\nHis eye-catching performances in the 2016/17 campaign also saw him named Ligue 1 Young Player of the Season.\n\nAnd it wasn't just in domestic football that he shone that year, as Monaco made a surprise run to the Champions League semi-finals, with Mbappe bagging six goals en route.\n\nHaving taken France and Europe by storm, it was not long before the teenager was attracting the interest of huge clubs, and he soon had a decision to make.\n\nUltimately, Mbappe opted for a return to his hometown by joining PSG on an initial loan deal in August 2017, with the Parisians obliged to sign him permanently for a fee of \u00a3163million the following year.\n\nArriving at PSG in the same transfer window as Brazilian superstar Neymar, who joined for a world-record fee, Mbappe was expected to help secure the club a long-awaited first Champions League title.\n\nDespite picking up where he left off at Monaco with another Ligue 1 title in 2018, the forward struggled to make his mark in Europe.\n\nIn his first two seasons in the French capital, Mbappe was unable to help PSG beyond the Champions League's last 16.\n\nHe came closest to delivering European glory for his club in 2020, reaching the final before suffering a heart-breaking 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich.\n\nDespite a lack of European success, the Frenchman's spell at the club was a fruitful one domestically, winning six Ligue 1 titles in seven seasons, and topping the league's scoring charts in as many.\n\nHe ended his time in Paris as the club's all-time record goalscorer, with 256 goals in 308 appearances and securing 15 major honours during this period.\n\nAnd he received recognition for his impressive achievements, being named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year a record five times.\n\nAfter years of being linked with a move to Real Madrid, Mbappe's dream move was finally confirmed in June 2024, joining Los Blancos on a free transfer following the expiration of his PSG contract.\n\nMbappe has had a huge impact on the international stage since making his international debut against Luxembourg in 2017, aged 18.\n\nAnd over a year later, whilst still a teenager, he cemented his status as one of the biggest names in world football as he helped France to their second World Cup title with victory in Russia in 2018.\n\nMbappe scored four goals as his county went all the way, including a goal in their 4-2 final win over Croatia, becoming the second teenager, after Brazil legend Pele, to score in a World Cup final.\n\nHis exploits that summer also saw him receive the tournament's Best Young Player award.\n\nAnd the 25-year-old clearly feels most at home on international football's biggest stage, as he was once again Les Blues' talisman at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nMbappe scored eight goals, including a hat-trick in the final, as France narrowly missed out on glory against Argentina, losing on penalties.\n\nDespite suffering heartache, he secured the Golden Boot, and was the first player to score a treble in a final since England's Geoff Hurst in 1966.\n\nAnd while similar success has eluded him in the European Championship, with France's semi-final run at Euro 2024 his best tournament finish, he has plenty of time left to improve on this.\n\nHaving been named France captain in 2023, and already ranking third in Les Blues' all-time goalscoring charts, Mbappe will be hoping he can lead his country to more silverware in years to come.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_riley@talksport.com", "name": "Martha Riley",

We rank the 10 biggest signings of the transfer window to date.\n\nNot only will his recent switch from France to Spain give him plenty of more benefits in terms of brand deals and off-field opportunities, but the car which he has personally chosen - a BMW i7 M70 - certainly comes with its complications.\n\nMbappe Unable to Drive Gifted Car The Frenchman has chosen BMW i7 M70\n\nPlaying for one of the - if not the - biggest clubs in the world has its obvious perks, but those added extras, as mentioned earlier, extend to off-the-field.\n\nBy virtue of Real Madrid's three-year sponsorship deal with BMW, each player is given a brand new electric vehicle free of charge. Even manager Carlo Ancelotti and club president Florentino Perez are gifted with a new motor at the start of every season.\n\nPer Marca, the dazzling Frenchman will receive a BMW i7 M70 thanks to signing on the dotted line in a deal that seemed inevitable. As luxurious as the car is, there's just one burning problem, however, and that is the fact that Mbappe does not have a driving license.\n\nThe car itself boasts two engines - one on the rear axle with 489 horsepower and another on the front with 258 horsepower, which allows it to reach speeds of 250 km/h and go from 0 to 100 in a mind-blowing 3.7 seconds. It retails for north of \u00a3164,000.\n\nMbappe, who turned 25 in November 2023, is eligible to drive given the legal age - in both France and now in Spain - is 18, meaning he could have passed his test six years ago.\n\nThat said, the footballing superstar's inability to drive has not acted as a deterrent to him splashing the cash on an array of super cars - ranging from a Ferrari 488 Pista to a Mercedes-Benz V Class, according to GOAL.\n\nKylian Mbappe - Senior Career Statistics\n\nClub\n\nGames\n\nGoals\n\nAssists\n\nYellow/Red Cards\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n308\n\n256\n\n108\n\n43/3\n\nFrance\n\n84\n\n48\n\n35\n\n8/0\n\nMonaco\n\n60\n\n27\n\n16\n\n3/0\n\nMbappe's Likely Real Madrid Debut Not part of the club's pre-season squad\n\nWith the move now official, the majority of the Real Madrid faithful are waiting patiently to see their new No.9 in action donning the fabled white of the iconic club following years and years of ever-growing speculation.\n\nFans turned out in their numbers at a packed-out Santiago Bernabeu to welcome the club's newest Galactico earlier this month. Though, he is not part of their pre-season squad, which travelled to the United States.\n\nRelated When Kylian Mbappe Will Make His Real Madrid Debut\n\nThe French superstar was announced in front of a sell-out Santiago Bernabeu and now excitement builds for his first appearance in the famous shirt.\n\nStill recovering from his involvement in France's Euro 2024 campaign, which ended in a 2-1 semi-final defeat, Mbappe is poised to link up with his new club colleagues on 7 August as they gear up for the 2024/25 season.\n\nParis-born Mbappe could make his competitive debut for the Spaniards just a week later, however, in their UEFA Super Cup clash with Atalanta, who won the Europa League last campaign with a 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nAll statistics per Transfermarkt -

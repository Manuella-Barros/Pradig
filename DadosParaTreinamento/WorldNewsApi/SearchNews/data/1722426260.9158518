{"id": 243324934, "title": "New claim of real reason Peterhead and Fraserburgh lost rail services &#8211; and it wasn&#8217;t Dr Beeching", "text": "It\u2019s become fashionable to blame Dr Richard Beeching for the devastation wrought to Scotland\u2019s railways in the 1960s. His name is inextricably linked with the word \u201caxe\u201d after he published his infamous report which sparked a major series of route closures and cuts across the Highlands and the north east as part of the restructuring of the nationalised system. These included the hammer falling on services from Aberdeen to communities such as Fraserburgh and Peterhead, for which the death knell sounded in 1965. Yet, a new book by transport expert, David Spaven, has laid bare that it wasn\u2019t Beeching who lost faith in the way trains operated in the region. It was the general public. Use it or lose it \u2013 a lesson from a long-lost railway And, while there are calls to revive the Buchan line, the statistics offer a cautionary tale of how more people liked the idea of trains on their doorstep than actually using them. The Formartine & Buchan Railway originally opened to the Blue Toon in 1862, striking off from the Aberdeen-Inverness line at Dyce, before heading north to Ellon and Maud, where it turned abruptly eastwards. The 16-mile \u201cbranch\u201d from Maud to Fraserburgh started operations in 1865 and these were significant links across the area for the next century. Yet they were struggling to cope with increasing car usage and alternative bus services by that stage. They could have fitted in a taxi In Scotland\u2019s Lost Branch Lines, Mr Spaven has explained how near-empty trains made expensive journeys to and from Aberdeen every day, especially during the winter. And, although there was a public outcry when the Beeching Report was initially released in 1963, it did nothing to halt the once-popular lines being scrapped. Mr Spaven said: \u201cThe front page of the Press & Journal on March 28 1963 was full of reactions to the Beeching Report, with one of the more melodramatic of the many headlines being: New Highland Clearances are Feared. \u201cFraserburgh \u2013 with its trains to Aberdeen being significantly faster than the bus \u2013 had much more to lose than Peterhead with its circuitous rail route. \u2018These cuts will harm us\u2019 \u201cUnder an editorial page headline Broch Provost \u2013 Doom If\u2026, Fraserburgh\u2019s provost Alex Noble commented: \u2018We did not expect cuts on this scale. \u201cWe are one of the highest areas of unemployment in the country and this will mean that more men will be out of work unless the railways in their wisdom have alternative work for the men who will be out of a job.\u201d However, British Rail\u2019s Heads of Information provides a detailed statement of the numbers of passengers using the Peterhead trains \u2018on representative days\u2019. With just three trains on weekdays from Maud to Peterhead (connecting out of services from Aberdeen to Fraserburgh) and four in the opposite direction \u2013 supplemented by a summer Saturday train in each direction \u2013 it was little surprise that numbers were low. And if you factored in the circuitous rail route compared to bus or car journeys, and the need to change trains at Maud, it is little wonder this service became unprofitable. The numbers simply didn\u2019t stack up Mr Spaven said: \u201cDuring the winter, a total of 30 passengers travelled daily in each direction on Mondays to Fridays, and 40 on Saturdays. \u201cIn the summer these figures increased to 50 on Mondays to Fridays and to 60/80 on Saturdays. But the busiest train \u2013 the 3.20pm from Peterhead to Maud on summer Mondays to Fridays \u2013 averaged only 25 passengers, which was not much more than half a single-decker bus load. \u201cAnd the three quietest trains had three or four passengers: just a taxi load.\u201d In these circumstances, the bosses and the unions, for once, were in agreement. And, three months after the publication of the report, a statutory British Rail public notice announced specific closure proposals for the lines to Fraserburgh, Peterhead and St Combs (and no fewer than 23 other stations served by these routes). This led to a warning from the Peterhead Provost, Robert Forman, about the consequences of the Beeching scythe casting a blight on the region. He said: \u201cIt is the easiest thing under the sun to close down the railways, but it takes a really big man to find a way of maintaining them.\u201d And yet, despite such misgivings, there were only 11 objections to the proposal. Mr Spaven told me: \u201cIt is not fashionable to say so, but, in some ways, Beeching has had an unfair press. \u201cHis promotion of fast inter-city services, \u2018merry-go-round\u2019 coal trains from colliery to power station and the pioneering Freightliner (container-carrying) concept took the railway in the right direction, all proving their worth in subsequent decades. His name is synonymous with the axe \u201cBut it was the closures \u2013 not intangible concepts, but threats to the life of places where people lived, worked or holidayed \u2013 which defined Beeching\u2019s image in the public mind. \u201cOf the 40 or so routes slated by Beeching for passenger closure in Scotland, only nine were reprieved (including Inverness to Kyle and Inverness to Wick and Thurso).\u201d These included the former Highland Main Line from Aviemore to Forres, via Grantown-on-Spey and Dava Summit; the Speyside Line, the Moray \u201cCoast Line\u201d and the Keith-Dufftown-Elgin \u201cGlen Line\u201d in the north east. And it spelled the end for the double-track Strathmore Route, where Glasgow-Aberdeen expresses traversed the fastest stretch of railway anywhere in Scotland. The oil boom arrived too late We shouldn\u2019t forget this happened only a few years before the discovery of the Forties Field in the North Sea in 1970 and the subsequent explosion in the oil and gas sector. That would have opened up new markets and probably been the catalyst for an upsurge in passenger numbers and enhanced quality of services and infrastructure. But it was too late. Once the routes were gone, they were gone. Scotland\u2019s Lost Branch Lines is published by Birlinn.

When they arrived, they found a 14-year-old female deceased with multiple stab wounds to the chest and neck.\n\nThat victim was later identified as Maria Loraine Honzell. She had been babysitting for a neighbor with two children who lived in the same apartment complex. When the neighbor returned home about 11:20 p.m. she found Maria deceased in the primary bedroom. The children, aged 6 and 8, were home at the time of the murder but were not harmed. They were found sleeping in bed when the neighbor returned home.\n\nAutopsy results showed that Maria sustained multiple stab wounds to the chest and one prominent stab wound to the neck area.\n\nDespite what is described as a thorough investigation, a suspect was not identified. During the decades advancements in DNA technology progressed and several items of evidence were submitted to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation for further scientific analysis. A male DNA profile was developed from a bloodstain on Maria's clothing but no match was found through a search using the Combined DNA Index System.\n\nDecades later, in 2019, investigators reached out to Parabon NanoLabs to conduct genetic genealogy DNA analysis involving public commercial DNA databases. The blood on the blue jumpsuit Maria was wearing the night she was murdered was submitted for genetic genealogy, which combines traditional genealogy research methods with DNA testing to infer relationships between individuals and determine their ancestry.\n\nAccording to Colorado Springs police, \"In the investigation of the homicide of Maria Honzell, Parabon submitted the genetic data profile created from the unknown crime scene DNA sample collected from the jumpsuit to a public genetic genealogy database for comparison in hopes of finding individuals who share significant amounts of DNA with the unknown subject. These genetic matches served as clues to inform traditional genealogy research: first, family trees of the matches were constructed back to the set of possible common ancestors using online genealogy databases, newspaper archives, public family trees, obituaries, and other public records, after which descendance research was employed to enumerate the possible identities of the unknown subject.\"\n\nDuring the extensive investigation, a person of interest was identified as William Charles Kernan, Jr. He also went by \"Bill.\" He died in 2010. Confirmation DNA was not able to be collected because Kernan had been cremated and had no living biological relatives. At the time, Kernan had been a student at a local college and had known the woman for whom Maria was babysitting on the night she was murdered. Investigators also said that Kernan had been to the apartment complex on prior occasions.\n\nAfter reviewing the case, the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office \"is confident the person responsible for the murder of Maria Honzell is William C.

Kernan, who died in 2010, was identified as the person responsible in the death of Honzell, who was 14 when she died on Feb. 7, 1977.\n\n\"Because (Kernan) died in 2010, the investigation into the murder of Maria Honzell will be closed out as exceptionally cleared,\" Caitlin Ford, a spokesperson with the Colorado Springs Police Department, said at a news conference.\n\nAccording to previous coverage by The Gazette, on the night of Feb. 7, 1977, Colorado Springs mother of two Janey Kusleika arrived home to find her babysitter, Honzell, dead with multiple stab wounds in her apartment bedroom along North Nevada Avenue. The two boys Honzell was babysitting, the children of Kusleika, were asleep and unharmed at the time police were called at around 11:20 p.m.\n\nReports state Kusleika and Honzell were neighbors and lived in the same apartment complex along the 5400 block of Nevada Avenue.\n\nKusleika told authorities she had spoken to Honzell on the phone just a few hours earlier, and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary at the time of the conversation.\n\nColorado Springs Cold Case podcast\n\nOne of the boys told police he had gone to sleep at around 8 p.m. but was awoken sometime later by commotion inside the apartment. He told investigators he saw a teenage boy in an apparent struggle with Honzell, holding her mouth shut.\n\nThe boy said he heard yelling and \"stop it\" before the two entered Kusleika's bedroom. He described the suspect as being approximately 17 years old, 6 feet tall with acne, and wearing a \"fluffy\" coat and jeans, previous reports state.\n\nAn autopsy report conducted in the days following Honzell's death determined she had died as a result of multiple stab wounds to the chest and a substantial wound to her throat. A homicide investigation was immediately launched by the department.\n\nAside from the boy's witness statement, leads in the case were sparse and the investigation went cold for decades until the department's DNA breakthrough.\n\nFord said while Kernan was named in initial investigation efforts, he wasn't considered a suspect around the time of Honzell's death.\n\nWhile the case remained cold for decades, DNA technology advanced. Although the Colorado Bureau of Investigation found no direct match from the male DNA profile discovered on the clothing Honzell wore the night she died, the department's cold case unit continued its search for answers.\n\nNews 25 cold cases in Colorado Springs Halle Thornton\n\nIn 2019, the police department contacted technology company Parabon NanoLabs to conduct a genetic genealogy analysis of the unknown male DNA sample discovered on Honzell's clothing.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"As time passed and technology progressed, it became clear that this case had the potential to move forward using genetic genealogy,\" said Tracey Thompson, a detective with CSPD's cold case unit.\n\nAccording to department officials, Parabon was able to develop and submit a genetic data profile of the unknown male DNA sample to the public database as a way to find individuals who \"share significant amounts of DNA with the unknown subject,\" officials said.\n\nFive years later, investigators found their match, and Kernan was identified. It was determined he was a student at a local college at the time of Honzell's death, and was an acquaintance of Kusleika -- the woman Honzell was babysitting for.\n\nPrior to the Honzell investigation, the department has successfully used genetic genealogy in solving three other cold cases, according to Thompson.\n\nAccording to Kernan's obituary, he was 61 at the time of his death in Cheyenne Wells, located on the Eastern plains near the Kansas border. Kernan was survived by a multitude of family members. He died of natural causes, officials said.\n\nNews 15 infamous cold cases in Colorado Halle Thornton\n\nWith no clear signs of a break-in reported from the scene at the time of the initial investigation, the motive behind Honzell's attack and why Kernan arrived at the apartment remain unclear.\n\nFamily members of Honzell in attendance Wednesday were emotional as members of the department among other law enforcement officials discussed the closing of Honzell's case.\n\nDavid Honzell, Maria's brother, addressed the room Wednesday morning, expressed gratitude for the department's work and shared the family's wishes for privacy .\n\n\"I've been on the phone at least once a week for the past five years calling, looking for updates,\" David Honzell said.\n\n\"Short and sweet, I appreciate you respecting our privacy. I would like to thank the whole department.\"\n\n\"This is a long time coming,\" CSPD Chief Adrian Vasquez said .\n\n\"Maria was a vibrant and beautiful 14-year-old girl who deserved so much more life. I am very grateful that you trusted us (CSPD) and we were able to solve this case,\" Vasquez said.\n\nThroughout the four decades CSPD detectives strived for justice in Honzell's homicide, Thompson estimates more than 15 detectives spent time on it -- not including patrol officers, investigators with the CBI and lab technicians who spent time piecing together evidence and developing forensic connections that went into identifying Kernan.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

A woman returned home to her apartment on North Nevada Avenue, in what is now University Village, to find her babysitter, just 14 at the time, dead in the master bedroom. The woman's two children, ages 6 and 8, were home at the time of the attack but were thankfully unharmed and asleep when their mother discovered Honzell's body.\n\nPolice responded and found Honzell, dressed in a blue jumpsuit, dead of multiple stab wounds to her neck and chest, and her death was ultimately ruled a homicide. At the time, CSPD conducted a thorough investigation, including interviews, reports, and the collection of evidence, including a blood sample from Honzell's clothing that did not belong to her.\n\nAs technology progressed, CSPD said a profile was built from the blood sample, confirming that it belonged to a man, though no match was found for the DNA, despite being tested against several potential suspects and being submitted to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).\n\n\"It can be difficult because, you know, you want to provide information. You want to give [the family] good news,\" said Tracey Thompson, a Cold Case Detective with CSPD. \"And when you're talking to them and constantly telling them, 'I'm sorry, I don't have anything right now.' Breaks your heart.\"\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: 45 years later, this Colorado Springs cold case remains unsolved\n\nWith no match to the DNA sample and no other identifying information on a potential suspect, Honzell's case went cold for decades.\n\n42 years later, in 2019, Honzell's case ignited with a spark of hope. CSPD reached out to Parabon NanoLabs to conduct genetic genealogy DNA analysis involving public commercial DNA databases. Genetic genealogy, as it is applied to cold cases, is the use of DNA samples in building a web of possible relatives and ancestors, in order to narrow down an unknown victim or offender.\n\nCSPD said the genetic genealogy matches that resulted from that inquiry led investigators to comb through family trees of possible ancestors, using online genealogy databases, newspaper archives, public family trees, obituaries, and other public records. Finally, a person of interest was identified: William Charles Kernan, Jr., who had been a student of a local college, and was an acquaintance of the woman Honzell was babysitting for on the night of her murder.\n\nUnfortunately, CSPD said it could not confirm a match between the crime scene DNA and the person of interest because Kernan had passed away in 2010 of natural causes, and he had been cremated. Kernan also had no living biological relatives. However, after a review of the case by the 4th Judicial DA's Office, including the genetic genealogy research, the DA's office said it is confident that Kernan is the person responsible for Honzell's murder.\n\nWhile a weight is lifted, the confirmation can be bittersweet, not just for the family, but for the investigators and officials involved in the case.\n\n\"In a sense, it can be disappointing,\" said 4th Judicial DA Michael Allen. \"That's what we do for our work here, is to bring people into the courtroom and make them relive the horror that they've visited on some other person. So in that respect, it is somewhat disappointing. But justice can take many forms.\"\n\nFor a family that had been left with nothing but questions for almost 50 years, that justice came in the form of answers.\n\n\"They've come through for us,\" said David Honzell, Maria's brother. \"I hope for other families it can be the same.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetic genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_profiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA profiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold Case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_DNA_Index_System", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combined DNA Index System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabon_NanoLabs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parabon NanoLabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_database", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cremation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Forensic_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Forensic Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/kxrm_colorado_springs_articles_460/f15c95f48021e56e051fcf39f30eefce", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551619", "eventUri": "eng-9551619", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Honzell was found on the night of February 7, 1977, at the Suncrest Apartments off of North Nevada Avenue.\n\nHonzell was found dead from multiple stab wounds in the apartment of a woman who had employed her to babysit. The woman came home after 11:00 pm to find Honzell dead and her two children asleep in their bedrooms. At the time of the murder, CSPD could not find a suspect based on the available evidence.\n\nAs the years progressed and DNA technology advanced, CSPD revisited the case. Evidence that had been preserved for decades was sent to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation for further analysis. CBI was able to produce a male DNA profile based on blood stains found on Honzell's clothing, however, it did not match any potential suspect DNA profiles and the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).\n\nThe case took a step in the right direction in 2019 when CSPD asked Parabon NanoLabs to use a variety of DNA and geological databases to find a match. Following the research William (Bill) Charles Kernan Jr. was identified as a suspect of interest. No DNA was recovered from Kernan as his body was cremated and has no living biological relatives.\n\nDespite this, Kernan was identified as a local college student and was a known acquaintance of the mother Honzell had been babysitting for, and through the cold case investigation had been to the apartment complex at previous times.\n\nAfter reviewing all the evidence the Fourth Judicial District Attorney's Office, says it is confident that William C Kernan Jr murdered Maria Honzell and will be closing the case.\n\nAccording to Tracey Thompson, a detective with the Colorado Springs Police Department Cold Case Department, the case of Maria Honzell has been open for 47 years. Thompson said this case was able to move forward thanks to the development of genetic genealogy technology.\n\nThompson was adamant that all cold cases with the Colorado Springs Police Department are open and the department continues to ask the public to come forward with any information.\n\n____\n\nNews Tips What should KOAA5 cover?

The woman said she had spoken with Honzell by phone that evening and there was no indication of a problem. The woman's children were unharmed. Read more about the case at colorado.gov.\n\nColorado Springs police on Wednesday announced that a cold case murder of teenager Maria Honzell more than 47 years ago was finally solved.\n\nThanks to the use of genetic genealogy, William C. Kernan, who died in 2010, was identified as the person responsible in the death of Honzell, who was 14 when she died on Feb. 7, 1977.\n\n\"Because (Kernan) died in 2010, the investigation into the murder of Maria Honzell will be closed out as exceptionally cleared,\" Caitlin Ford, a spokesperson with the Colorado Springs Police Department, said at a news conference.\n\nAccording to previous coverage by The Gazette, on the night of Feb. 7, 1977, Colorado Springs mother of two Janey Kusleika arrived home to find her babysitter, Honzell, dead with multiple stab wounds in her apartment bedroom along North Nevada Avenue. The two boys Honzell was babysitting, the children of Kusleika, were asleep and unharmed at the time police were called at around 11:20 p.m.\n\nReports state Kusleika and Honzell were neighbors and lived in the same apartment complex along the 5400 block of Nevada Avenue.\n\nKusleika told authorities she had spoken to Honzell on the phone just a few hours earlier, and that nothing seemed out of the ordinary at the time of the conversation.\n\nColorado Springs Cold Case podcast\n\nOne of the boys told police he had gone to sleep at around 8 p.m. but was awoken sometime later by commotion inside the apartment. He told investigators he saw a teenage boy in an apparent struggle with Honzell, holding her mouth shut.\n\nThe boy said he heard yelling and \"stop it\" before the two entered Kusleika's bedroom. He described the suspect as being approximately 17 years old, 6 feet tall with acne, and wearing a \"fluffy\" coat and jeans, previous reports state.\n\nAn autopsy report conducted in the days following Honzell's death determined she had died as a result of multiple stab wounds to the chest and a substantial wound to her throat. A homicide investigation was immediately launched by the department.\n\nAside from the boy's witness statement, leads in the case were sparse and the investigation went cold for decades until the department's DNA breakthrough.\n\nFord said while Kernan was named in initial investigation efforts, he wasn't considered a suspect around the time of Honzell's death.\n\nWhile the case remained cold for decades, DNA technology advanced. Although the Colorado Bureau of Investigation found no direct match from the male DNA profile discovered on the clothing Honzell wore the night she died, the department's cold case unit continued its search for answers.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIn 2019, the police department contacted technology company Parabon NanoLabs to conduct a genetic genealogy analysis of the unknown male DNA sample discovered on Honzell's clothing.\n\n\"As time passed and technology progressed, it became clear that this case had the potential to move forward using genetic genealogy,\" said Tracey Thompson, a detective with CSPD's cold case unit.\n\nAccording to department officials, Parabon was able to develop and submit a genetic data profile of the unknown male DNA sample to the public database as a way to find individuals who \"share significant amounts of DNA with the unknown subject,\" officials said.\n\nFive years later, investigators found their match, and Kernan was identified. It was determined he was a student at a local college at the time of Honzell's death, and was an acquaintance of Kusleika -- the woman Honzell was babysitting for.\n\nPrior to the Honzell investigation, the department has successfully used genetic genealogy in solving three other cold cases, according to Thompson.\n\nAccording to Kernan's obituary, he was 61 at the time of his death in Cheyenne Wells, located on the Eastern plains near the Kansas border. Kernan was survived by a multitude of family members. He died of natural causes, officials said.\n\nWith no clear signs of a break-in reported from the scene at the time of the initial investigation, the motive behind Honzell's attack and why Kernan arrived at the apartment remain unclear.\n\nFamily members of Honzell in attendance Wednesday were emotional as members of the department among other law enforcement officials discussed the closing of Honzell's case.\n\nDavid Honzell, Maria's brother, addressed the room Wednesday morning, expressed gratitude for the department's work and shared the family's wishes for privacy .\n\n\"I've been on the phone at least once a week for the past five years calling, looking for updates,\" David Honzell said.\n\n\"Short and sweet, I appreciate you respecting our privacy. I would like to thank the whole department.\"\n\n\"This is a long time coming,\" CSPD Chief Adrian Vasquez said .\n\n\"Maria was a vibrant and beautiful 14-year-old girl who deserved so much more life. I am very grateful that you trusted us (CSPD) and we were able to solve this case,\" Vasquez said.\n\nThroughout the four decades CSPD detectives strived for justice in Honzell's homicide, Thompson estimates more than 15 detectives spent time on it -- not including patrol officers, investigators with the CBI and lab technicians who spent time piecing together evidence and developing forensic connections that went into identifying Kernan.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

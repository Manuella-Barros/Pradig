He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes, according to a sentencing memo.\n\nCNN reached out to Montgomery's attorneys, Caroline Smith and James Brooks, for comment.\n\nAuthorities concluded that Harmony was killed in December 2019 in Manchester. Her remains have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported.\n\nMontgomery murdered Harmony on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \"transportation and consolidation of her body over three months\" before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020, prosecutors said in the sentencing memo.\n\n\"Despite the defendant's concession at trial that he disposed of Harmony's body, her remains have not been found, and as a result, she has been deprived of a proper burial,\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nSorey reported Harmony missing in 2021, saying she hadn't seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Police said Harmony was last seen in October 2019.\n\nA 101-page report by New Hampshire's Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony's time bouncing between her mother's care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \"with such force that he altered the profile of her face.\"\n\nThe Department of Children and Families previously said the report \"illustrates the grave responsibility of balancing the child's safety and best interest and a parents' legal rights to have custody of their child.\"\n\nProsecutors said in the sentencing memo Montgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her.\n\n\"The defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something 'different' and acknowledged out loud that he believed he 'really hurt her this time,'\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nIt's possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \"cruelty and depravity\" that warrants more than just the minimum sentence.\n\nIn the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nMontgomery then embarked on a \"strategy of blaming others for Harmony's injuries and death,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nProsecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story.\n\nKayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March.\n\nProsecutors said Montgomery has displayed a lack of remorse for killing his daughter, writing that one witness said Montgomery \"admitted to her that he hated Harmony to his core.\"\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act. Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery's \"extensive\" criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.\n\nCNN's Nicki Brown, Nic F. Anderson and Zenebou Sylla contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_tampering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witness tampering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMUR-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WMUR-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FaceTime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/8482a01f00497e31c725b2ec663671b2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-07", "textStart": 1074, "textEnd": 1090}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-04", "textStart": 1215, "textEnd": 1228}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 2343, "textEnd": 2353}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 856, "textEnd": 869}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 1632, "textEnd": 1644}], "sentiment": -0.592156862745098, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes, according to a sentencing memo.\n\nCNN reached out to Montgomery's attorneys, Caroline Smith and James Brooks, for comment.\n\nAuthorities concluded that Harmony was killed in December 2019 in Manchester. Her remains have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported.\n\nMontgomery murdered Harmony on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \"transportation and consolidation of her body over three months\" before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020, prosecutors said in the sentencing memo.\n\n\"Despite the defendant's concession at trial that he disposed of Harmony's body, her remains have not been found, and as a result, she has been deprived of a proper burial,\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nSorey reported Harmony missing in 2021, saying she hadn't seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Police said Harmony was last seen in October 2019.\n\nA 101-page report by New Hampshire's Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony's time bouncing between her mother's care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \"with such force that he altered the profile of her face.\"\n\nThe Department of Children and Families previously said the report \"illustrates the grave responsibility of balancing the child's safety and best interest and a parents' legal rights to have custody of their child.\"\n\nProsecutors said in the sentencing memo Montgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her.\n\n\"The defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something 'different' and acknowledged out loud that he believed he 'really hurt her this time,'\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nIt's possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \"cruelty and depravity\" that warrants more than just the minimum sentence.\n\nIn the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nMontgomery then embarked on a \"strategy of blaming others for Harmony's injuries and death,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nProsecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story.\n\nKayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March.\n\nProsecutors said Montgomery has displayed a lack of remorse for killing his daughter, writing that one witness said Montgomery \"admitted to her that he hated Harmony to his core.\"\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act. Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery's \"extensive\" criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A judge has ordered him to attend his sentencing, scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday in Hillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester.\n\nAdam Montgomery's attorneys earlier acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he \"purposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed\" her corpse and falsified physical evidence, but said he didn't kill his daughter. The jury also convicted him of assaulting Harmony in 2019 and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife and stepmother of his daughter, Kayla Montgomery.\n\nInvestigators believe Harmony Montgomery was slain in December 2019, though she wasn't reported missing for almost two years. Kayla Montgomery testified that the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent and a workplace freezer before Adam Montgomery disposed of it.\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, Crystal Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year's Eve 2021.\n\nPhotos of the girl were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.\n\nKayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child's disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. She testified that that her husband killed Harmony Montgomery on Dec. 7, 2019, while the family lived in their car after being evicted from their home.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony Montgomery in the face and head because he was angry that she was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nThe couple noticed the girl was dead hours later when the car broke down, at which time Adam Montgomery put her body in a duffel bag, Kayla Montgomery had testified.\n\nFor the next three months, she testified, Adam Montgomery moved the body from container to container and place to place. According to his wife, the locations included the trunk of a friend's car, a cooler in the hallway of his mother-in-law's apartment building, the ceiling vent of a homeless shelter and a workplace freezer.\n\nAuthorities have said previously that the trial does not end the search for the girl.\n\nAdam Montgomery is already serving a sentence of up to 60 years in prison after being convicted on separate weapons charges in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillsborough County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hillsborough County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffel_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duffel bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intermodal container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2023/06/Adam-Montgomery-Court-copy.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-07", "textStart": 2497, "textEnd": 2509}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 1578, "textEnd": 1591}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 2001, "textEnd": 2011}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A New Hampshire man convicted of killing his 5-year-old daughter and moving her corpse around for months before disposing of it was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 56 years in prison on murder and other changes as relatives of the child called him a monster.\n\nThat sentence will be added on to the minimum 32 1/2-year sentence Adam Montgomery, 34, began last year on unrelated gun charges, effectively amounting to a life sentence following his actions in the death of Harmony Montgomery. Police believe she was killed nearly two years before she was reported missing in 2021. Her body was never found.\n\nA prosecutor offered to lessen the sentence for the second-degree murder conviction and other charges if Montgomery \"tells us right now\" the location of his daughter's remains. Montgomery, who has maintained his innocence in the death of his daughter, did not speak in the Manchester courtroom. His attorney later called the offer a \"stunt\" and said Montgomery's silence should not be interpreted as a lack of remorse.\n\nPeople who knew Harmony Montgomery spoke about the happy, kind child they once knew.\n\n\"She had a life worth living, unlike your own,\" Crystal Sorey, Harmony's mother, read from a statement addressing Adam Montgomery, her hands shaking. \"And it bothered you to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me.\"\n\nSorey added, \"I will forever look for her until the end of my days. But I hope that every day and every night here on this earth, you hear nothing but my baby's giggle.\"\n\nThe parents who adopted Harmony's brother, now 7, spoke on his behalf. \"I'm really sad she's an angel. I miss her,\" they quoted him as saying.\n\nMontgomery did not attend his trial in February. He was ordered by the judge to be in court Thursday after his lawyer asked for him to be excused. Montgomery also had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree assault and witness tampering. He had admitted to abuse of acorpse and falsifying evidence.\n\nJudge Amy Messer noted that Montgomery had an extensive criminal record that dates back to 2008 and that he had extensive opportunities to change his life.\n\n\"Your extreme indifference to the value of human life is seen in so many of your actions,\" she said.\n\nMesser said the only way to keep Montgomery from hurting others is to keep him off the streets. \"To the extent you seek to rehabilitate yourself, that will have to happen behind the prison walls,\" she said.\n\nAn email seeking comment on the sentence and asking about a possible appeal was sent to Montgomery's lawyer, Caroline Smith.\n\nHis estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, had testified that her family, including her two young sons with Adam Montgomery, had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. She said on Dec. 7, Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nAfter that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony Montgomery and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl's body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a homeless center ceiling vent and the walk-in freezer at her husband's workplace.\n\nDuring Adam Montgomery's trial, his lawyers suggested that Kayla continued to lie to protect herself. They said their client did not kill Harmony, and that Kayla Montgomery was the last person to see the child alive.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that she didn't come forward about the child's death because she was afraid of her husband. She said Adam Montgomery suspected that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021.\n\nKayla Montgomery was recently granted parole. She is expected to be released from prison soon after serving an 18-month sentence. She pleaded guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child's disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\n\"I will forever have a place in my heart for you,\" Kayla Montgomery said in a statement read in court on her behalf. But she talked about how their relationship spiraled out of control after Harmony died. \"The last couple of nights after you got arrested for the first time, I was sleeping with a knife because I did not know what you were going to do to me,\" she wrote, adding, \"I'm so angry and hurt by you.\"\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year's Eve 2021. Adam and Kayla Montgomery told police that Adam had taken his daughter to live with Sorey in Massachusetts.\n\nHarmony Montgomery's case has exposed weaknesses in child protection systems and provoked calls to prioritize the well-being of children over parents in custody matters. Harmony was moved between the homes of her mother and her foster parents multiple times before Adam Montgomery received custody in 2019 and moved to New Hampshire.\n\nAuthorities plan to keep searching for the girl's remains, believed to be along a route Adam Montgomery drove in a rental truck into Massachusetts in March 2020. Agati said Thursday that police last went out for a search a couple of weeks ago, but they were not successful.", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_tampering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witness tampering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methadone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "summary_large_image", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 2799, "textEnd": 2805}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 4811, "textEnd": 4821}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 5526, "textEnd": 5536}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes, according to a sentencing memo.\n\nCNN reached out to Montgomery's attorneys, Caroline Smith and James Brooks, for comment.\n\nAuthorities concluded that Harmony was killed in December 2019 in Manchester. Her remains have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported.\n\nMontgomery murdered Harmony on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \"transportation and consolidation of her body over three months\" before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020, prosecutors said in the sentencing memo.\n\n\"Despite the defendant's concession at trial that he disposed of Harmony's body, her remains have not been found, and as a result, she has been deprived of a proper burial,\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nSorey reported Harmony missing in 2021, saying she hadn't seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Police said Harmony was last seen in October 2019.\n\nA 101-page report by New Hampshire's Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony's time bouncing between her mother's care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \"with such force that he altered the profile of her face.\"\n\nHarmony Montgomery was reported missing in 2021, but authorities determined she was killed in 2019. Jim Davis/Pool/The Boston Globe/AP\n\nThe Department of Children and Families previously said the report \"illustrates the grave responsibility of balancing the child's safety and best interest and a parents' legal rights to have custody of their child.\"\n\nProsecutors said in the sentencing memo Montgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her.\n\n\"The defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something 'different' and acknowledged out loud that he believed he 'really hurt her this time,'\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nIt's possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \"cruelty and depravity\" that warrants more than just the minimum sentence.\n\nIn the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nMontgomery then embarked on a \"strategy of blaming others for Harmony's injuries and death,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nProsecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story.\n\nKayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March.\n\nProsecutors said Montgomery has displayed a lack of remorse for killing his daughter, writing that one witness said Montgomery \"admitted to her that he hated Harmony to his core.\"\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act. Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery's \"extensive\" criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.\n\nCNN's Nicki Brown, Nic F.

He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes, according to a sentencing memo.\n\nCNN reached out to Montgomery's attorneys, Caroline Smith and James Brooks, for comment.\n\nAuthorities concluded that Harmony was killed in December 2019 in Manchester. Her remains have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported.\n\nMontgomery murdered Harmony on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \"transportation and consolidation of her body over three months\" before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020, prosecutors said in the sentencing memo.\n\n\"Despite the defendant's concession at trial that he disposed of Harmony's body, her remains have not been found, and as a result, she has been deprived of a proper burial,\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nSorey reported Harmony missing in 2021, saying she hadn't seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Police said Harmony was last seen in October 2019.\n\nA 101-page report by New Hampshire's Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony's time bouncing between her mother's care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \"with such force that he altered the profile of her face.\"\n\nThe Department of Children and Families previously said the report \"illustrates the grave responsibility of balancing the child's safety and best interest and a parents' legal rights to have custody of their child.\"\n\nProsecutors said in the sentencing memo Montgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her.\n\n\"The defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something 'different' and acknowledged out loud that he believed he 'really hurt her this time,'\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nIt's possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \"cruelty and depravity\" that warrants more than just the minimum sentence.\n\nIn the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nMontgomery then embarked on a \"strategy of blaming others for Harmony's injuries and death,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nProsecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story.\n\nKayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March.\n\nProsecutors said Montgomery has displayed a lack of remorse for killing his daughter, writing that one witness said Montgomery \"admitted to her that he hated Harmony to his core.\"\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act. Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery's \"extensive\" criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Harmony's remains have not been found.\n\nHe will be sentenced at 1 p.m. on Thursday in Merrimack County Superior Court in Concord. New Hampshire prosecutors have recommended a sentence of 56 years to life in prison.\n\nAdam Montgomery, who was already sentenced to decades behind bars in August 2023 on gun charges, claimed he did not kill his daughter. However, a jury found him guilty in February of second-degree murder, assault, abuse of a corpse charges, and falsifying physical evidence.\n\nPolice said Harmony was killed by her father in December 2019.\n\nProsecutors said Adam Montgomery treated his daughter like a thing he'd broken and needed to throw away, but his lawyer said he wasn't guilty of her death even though he made terrible decisions to hide and move her body.\n\nAuthorities said he beat his daughter to death. Police said he repeatedly punched Harmony in the head and disposed of her body.\n\nHarmony was 5 years old when she was last seen in early December 2019. But authorities didn't know she was missing until the fall of 2021.\n\nIn November 2021, Harmony's biological mother reported to police that she hadn't seen her daughter in person for quite some time. A Massachusetts judge granted Harmony's father sole custody.\n\nHer remains have never been found but police have biological evidence she was murdered.\n\nKayla Montgomery, who is Adam Montgomery's estranged wife, told police that on Dec. 7, 2019, Adam Montgomery was driving in Manchester, New Hampshire, when he turned and punched Harmony in the face and head three or four times because she was having accidents in the car and not telling him when she needed to go to the bathroom.\n\nKayla Montgomery stated that after the final blow, Adam Montgomery said he reportedly felt something or heard something when he hit Harmony.\n\n\"I think I really hurt her this time. I think I did something,\" Adam Montgomery reportedly said.\n\nHarmony reportedly began making moaning noises, which went on for about five minutes and then stopped, according to court documents.\n\nPolice say at no time did anyone stop to get Harmony medical attention.\n\nKayla and Adam Montgomery eventually discovered that Harmony was dead, according to court documents.\n\nAccording to court documents, Kayla Montgomery told police Harmony's body was moved to various locations over the course of the next several months, including a cooler, the ceiling of a shelter, a walk-in cooler at a restaurant Adam Montgomery worked at, and refrigerators.\n\nKayla Montgomery reportedly told police that in the spring of 2020 Adam Montgomery rented a U-Haul and made a trip to an unknown destination to dispose of Harmony's body.\n\nAccording to court documents, Kayla Montgomery stated she did not know the location of where Adam Montgomery allegedly dumped the body.\n\nAdam Montgomery reportedly had a history of abusing Harmony. Investigators said while they were talking to Harmony's uncle, he revealed that Adam Montgomery had told him he caused an eye injury to her in 2019.\n\nAdam Montgomery allegedly said, \"I bashed her around the house.\"\n\nCourt documents also say Adam Montgomery ordered her to \"scrub the toilet with her toothbrush.\"\n\n\"He hated Harmony to his core,\" Assistant New Hampshire Attorney General Christopher Knowles said during the trial. \"And the evidence is gonna show that he did everything to destroy harmony after he beat her, to hide his crime tied evidence of what he'd done.\"\n\nThe defense told a different story. Defense Attorney James Brooks said Kayla Montgomery had been lying all along.\n\nWhile on the stand, Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband beat her in the months after his daughter's death, threatening her not to talk to the police.\n\nShe served time for perjury and said she only lied to a grand jury in 2022 because she feared for her safety. She was released on parole in March.\n\nAmong those who took the stand were Harmony's foster mother, who took in Harmony when she was a baby.\n\n\"She was a loving child. Very sweet,\" foster mother Michelle Raftery said. \"Very happy. She was super social. She loved to be with people. We used to joke around with her, she left a sparkle wherever she went because wherever she went, she left people happy, and you knew that you met her.\"\n\nHarmony Montgomery's biological mother, Crystal Sorey, also testified during the trial. She got emotional when prosecutors asked her about the last time she saw her daughter.\n\nAdam Montgomery and Sorey were not in a relationship when their daughter was born in 2014. Harmony Montgomery lived on and off with foster families and her mother until Sorey lost custody in 2018. Montgomery was awarded custody in early 2019, and Sorey testified she last saw her daughter during a FaceTime call around Easter of that year.\n\nIn March, a judge has ruled that Harmony is legally dead and her mother can become administrator of her estate.\n\nSorey is taking the first steps in preparation of a planned wrongful death lawsuit against the state regarding Harmony Montgomery.", "source": {"uri": "bakersfieldnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBAK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ariana_st_pierre@bakersfieldnow.com", "name": "Ariana St Pierre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrimack_County,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrimack County, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Merrimack County, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Knowles_(poet)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Knowles (poet)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://bakersfieldnow.com/resources/media/668918a6-27a1-4a19-823d-88c766074a3c-large16x9_AP24038539932881.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-07", "textStart": 1740, "textEnd": 1752}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 873, "textEnd": 886, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- A New Hampshire man convicted of killing his 5-year-old daughter and moving her corpse around for months before disposing of it was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 56 years in prison on murder and other changes.\n\nThat sentence will be added on to the minimum 32 1/2-year sentence Adam Montgomery, 34, began last year on unrelated gun charges, making it unlikely that he will ever get out of prison following his actions in the death of Harmony Montgomery. Police believe she was killed nearly two years before she was reported missing in 2021. Her body was never found.\n\nMontgomery did not attend the trial in February. He was ordered by the judge to be in court Thursday after his lawyer asked for him to be excused, saying Montgomery has maintained his innocence on charges of second-degree murder, second-degree assault and witness tampering. He had admitted to abuse of a corpse and falsifying evidence.\n\nHis estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, had testified that her family, including her two young sons with Adam Montgomery, had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. She said on Dec. 7, Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nAfter that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony Montgomery and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl's body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a homeless center ceiling vent and the walk-in freezer at her husband's workplace.\n\nDuring Adam Montgomery's trial, his lawyers suggested that Kayla continued to lie to protect herself. They said their client did not kill Harmony, and that Kayla Montgomery was the last person to see the child alive.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that she didn't come forward about the child's death because she was afraid of her husband. She said Adam Montgomery suspected that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021.\n\nKayla Montgomery was recently granted parole. She is expected to be released from prison soon after serving an 18-month sentence. She pleaded guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child's disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl.

(AP) -- A New Hampshire man convicted of killing his 5-year-old daughter and moving her corpse around for months before disposing of it was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 56 years in prison on murder and other changes.\n\nThat sentence will be added on to the minimum 32 1/2-year sentence Adam Montgomery, 34, began last year on unrelated gun charges, making it unlikely that he will ever get out of prison following his actions in the death of Harmony Montgomery. Police believe she was killed nearly two years before she was reported missing in 2021. Her body was never found.\n\nMontgomery did not attend the trial in February. He was ordered by the judge to be in court Thursday after his lawyer asked for him to be excused, saying Montgomery has maintained his innocence on charges of second-degree murder, second-degree assault and witness tampering. He had admitted to abuse of a corpse and falsifying evidence.\n\nHis estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, had testified that her family, including her two young sons with Adam Montgomery, had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. She said on Dec. 7, Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nAfter that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony Montgomery and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl's body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a homeless center ceiling vent and the walk-in freezer at her husband's workplace.\n\nDuring Adam Montgomery's trial, his lawyers suggested that Kayla continued to lie to protect herself. They said their client did not kill Harmony, and that Kayla Montgomery was the last person to see the child alive.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that she didn't come forward about the child's death because she was afraid of her husband. She said Adam Montgomery suspected that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021.\n\nKayla Montgomery was recently granted parole. She is expected to be released from prison soon after serving an 18-month sentence. She pleaded guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child's disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, Crystal Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year's Eve 2021.\n\nHarmony Montgomery's case has exposed weaknesses in child protection systems and provoked calls to prioritize the well-being of children over parents in custody matters.

He was also found guilty of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors have asked that Montgomery be sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for all of the crimes, according to a sentencing memo. The prosecutors said he has displayed a lack of remorse for killing his daughter, writing that one witness said he \"admitted to her that he hated Harmony to his core.\"\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act. Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nCNN reached out to Montgomery's attorneys, Caroline Smith and James Brooks, for comment.\n\nAuthorities concluded that Harmony was killed in December 2019 in Manchester. Her remains have not been found, though a judge declared her legally dead in March at the request of her mother, Crystal Sorey, CNN affiliate WMUR reported.\n\nMontgomery murdered Harmony on December 7, 2019, and then engaged in the \"transportation and consolidation of her body over three months\" before disposing of her corpse on March 4, 2020, prosecutors said in the sentencing memo.\n\n\"Despite the defendant's concession at trial that he disposed of Harmony's body, her remains have not been found, and as a result, she has been deprived of a proper burial,\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nA 101-page report by the Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate detailed Harmony's time bouncing between her mother's care and foster care before a judge decided to award custody to Montgomery in 2019.\n\nHarmony was born in June 2014 and was blind in one eye and had other medical concerns, according to the report.\n\nThat summer, a Department of Children and Families office received reports of neglect while the baby was living with her mother, who was struggling with substance abuse, according to the report. Her father was incarcerated at the time of her birth and \"not involved in Harmony's life,\" the report said.\n\nHarmony was legally removed from her mother's care and placed in a foster home, the report said, and she cycled between her mother's care and the care of the Department of Children and Families over several years.\n\nMontgomery had inconsistent contact and supervised visits with his daughter over the next couple of years, but in October 2018 he asked for Harmony to be placed in his care, according to the report.\n\nIn February 2019, a judge awarded him full custody and ruled a home study about Montgomery under the Interstate Compact of the Placement of Children (ICPS) - an agreement between all states governing the placement of children across borders - did not apply for constitutional reasons because he had been found to be a fit parent.\n\nMontgomery then took his daughter to New Hampshire roughly a week after the hearing and the Department of Children and Families involvement ended, the report said.\n\nSorey reported Harmony missing in November 2021, saying she hadn't seen her daughter since a FaceTime call in the spring of 2019. Manchester Police then announced a search for her whereabouts, leading to Montgomery's arrest in early 2022.\n\nThe judge's decision to place Harmony with her father has come under intense scrutiny. New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu wrote a scathing letter to the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court about the decision. In response, the Massachusetts Office of Child Advocate wrote the 101-page report on her case and found state officials prioritized Harmony's parents' rights over her well-being.\n\n\"By not putting her and her needs first, our system ultimately failed her,\" OCA director Maria Mossaides said. \"We owe it to her to make the changes necessary to allow our system to do better in the future.\"\n\nIn the prosecution's sentencing memo, prosecutors said some of the charges stemmed from an episode in 2019, in which Montgomery struck Harmony \"with such force that he altered the profile of her face.\"\n\nMontgomery attacked Harmony several times on December 7 after she had a bathroom accident, ultimately killing her, the memo states.\n\n\"The defendant struck Harmony numerous times while driving, stopping at lights several times to continue the attack. He only stopped striking Harmony when he felt something 'different' and acknowledged out loud that he believed he 'really hurt her this time,'\" the sentencing memo reads.\n\nIt's possible that Montgomery could have spared Harmony some pain, or even saved her, by getting her help after the attacks, prosecutors said. The fact that he chose not to, they argued, displayed a level of \"cruelty and depravity\" that warrants more than just the minimum sentence.\n\nIn the two years after murdering Harmony, prosecutors said Montgomery told others, including law enforcement officers, that his daughter was alive and well with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nMontgomery then embarked on a \"strategy of blaming others for Harmony's injuries and death,\" the sentencing memo states.\n\nProsecutors said he made up a lie about what happened to Harmony and beat her stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, ordering her to stick to the story.\n\nKayla Montgomery pleaded guilty in 2022 to lying to a grand jury about her whereabouts the last time her stepdaughter was seen, according to a parole hearing and court records. She testified against her estranged husband in February and was granted parole in March.\n\nIn the sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that Montgomery's \"extensive\" criminal history, which includes threatening a teenager with a knife and shooting a person in the face during a robbery, should be considered in his sentencing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(AP) - A New Hampshire man convicted of killing his 5-year-old daughter and moving her corpse around for months before disposing of it was sentenced Thursday to a minimum of 56 years in prison on murder and other changes.\n\nThat sentence will be added on to the minimum 32 1/2-year sentence Adam Montgomery, 34, began last year on unrelated gun charges, making it unlikely that he will ever get out of prison following his actions in the death of Harmony Montgomery. Police believe she was killed nearly two years before she was reported missing in 2021. Her body was never found.\n\nMontgomery did not attend the trial in February. He was ordered by the judge to be in court Thursday after his lawyer asked for him to be excused, saying Montgomery has maintained his innocence on charges of second-degree murder, second-degree assault and witness tampering. He had admitted to abuse of a corpse and falsifying evidence.\n\nHis estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, had testified that her family, including her two young sons with Adam Montgomery, had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. She said on Dec. 7, Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nAfter that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony Montgomery and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl\u00b4s body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a homeless center ceiling vent and the walk-in freezer at her husband\u00b4s workplace.\n\nDuring Adam Montgomery\u00b4s trial, his lawyers suggested that Kayla continued to lie to protect herself. They said their client did not kill Harmony, and that Kayla Montgomery was the last person to see the child alive.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that she didn\u00b4t come forward about the child\u00b4s death because she was afraid of her husband. She said Adam Montgomery suspected that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021.\n\nKayla Montgomery was recently granted parole. She is expected to be released from prison soon after serving an 18-month sentence. She pleaded guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child\u00b4s disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, Crystal Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year\u00b4s Eve 2021.\n\nHarmony Montgomery\u00b4s case has exposed weaknesses in child protection systems and provoked calls to prioritize the well-being of children over parents in custody matters. Harmony was moved between the homes of her mother and her foster parents multiple times before Adam Montgomery received custody in 2019 and moved to New Hampshire.\n\nAuthorities plan to keep searching for the girl's remains, believed to be along a route Adam Montgomery drove in a rental truck into Massachusetts in March 2020.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_tampering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witness tampering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methadone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 1142, "textEnd": 1148}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 2763, "textEnd": 2773}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 3372, "textEnd": 3382}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Judge Amy Messer, who oversaw his murder trial, carried out the sentencing. Prosecutors Christopher Knowles and New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Ben Agati were also in court.\n\nAdam Montgomery was accused of beating and killing Harmony on Dec. 7, 2019, while the family was living in their Chrysler Sebring. Harmony had several bathroom accidents in the car and Montgomery yelled and hit her in the head, according to prosecutors.\n\nMontgomery admitted to two of the lesser charges in the case on Feb. 7: falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse. Montgomery did not appear in court during his trial, nor was he present when the jury delivered the verdict. He was Messer ordered Adam Montgomery to appear at his sentencing.\n\nAgati asked Messer how the minimum prison sentence could apply to Adam Montgomery after the \"horror story\" of what happened to Harmony. He then reiterated what happened to Harmony and the abuse she suffered, and how the minimum sentence applies to someone who still has not told investigators where Harmony's body is.\n\nBefore he was sentenced, Messer said Adam Montgomery showed recklessness that \"in this context is not something to be an accident. It's extreme indifference to the value of human life.\"\n\nMesser sentenced Adam Montgomery to serve 45 years to life for the conviction of second-degree murder, which runs concurrently with the other charges of second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse, all in connection with the death in 2019 and disappearance in 2020 of his 5-year-old daughter, Harmony.\n\n\"The decision today lies with the court regardless of what the state says,\" Agati said before Adam Montgomery was sentenced. \"If the defendant will tell us right now where he hid the body so that her family and Manchester police can recover her remains within the next seven days, the state will reconsider its sentence to 35 years.\"\n\nAfter Adam Montgomery and his lawyers did not answer, Agati retorted that what he said was not a stunt and that Adam Montgomery's response was a \"heartless, selfish and unapologetic murderer of his own child.\"\n\nAgati brought up Harmony Montgomery's biological mother Crystal Sorey to read her statement aloud \"to the monster who murdered my baby.\"\n\n\"She would be thriving right now, not stuffed inside a CMC bag right now,\" Sorey said in tears. \"... She wasn't a coward like you, and I will be grateful for that ... She lit up a room when she walked in and you couldn't stand it. She was a great big sister and I know she loved your sons too, no matter what picture you paint of her.\"\n\n\"You may have taken her physically away from me, but she is always, always with me,\" she said. \"... Harmony will live on through me and you can do nothing about it.\"\n\n\"You're just plain evil,\" Sorey concluded.\n\nIn a statement submitted by Kayla Montgomery, Harmony's step-mother, but read by a court official, she said she still loves him and hopes to see him again one day.\n\nHusbands Blair Miller and Johnathon Bobbitt-Miller, who adopted Harmony's brother Jamison, both gave their statement too.\n\n\"He would look in the shadows in his closet and ask 'Is that Harmony there?'\" Miller said, his voice croaked. \"... Jamison constantly asks us 'Who took my sister away?' Adam, you introduced murder into his life ... your honor, we ask that you impose the maximum sentence.\"\n\n\"My God, how do we process and tell [Jamison] these details of what happened to his big sister?\" Bobbitt-Miller said through tears. \"... Adam he would plead with you to tell him where she is.\"\n\n\"I hope she's eating M&M's in heaven, I hope her glasses are not broken and I miss her,\" Bobbitt-Miller said, reading Jamison's words.\n\nDuring each statement and Agati's requests, Adam Montgomery sat quietly in a white T-shirt, bearded and frequently licking his lips.\n\nSmith said her client did not need to show remorse because he maintains his innocence despite being found guilty.\n\nIn a statement released after the sentencing, New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said Harmony's memory and legacy remain our focus.\"\n\n\"The murder of an innocent child leaves a lasting scar on New Hampshire and our hearts go out to Harmony's family and all those who knew and loved her,\" Formella said. \"I want to thank our dedicated trial team and all of our law enforcement partners for their work on this case, especially the dedicated law enforcement professionals with the Manchester Police Department. Their tireless efforts led to the justice Harmony received in the sentence handed down today. While no sentence can bring back the life that was taken, we will honor Harmony's memory by working to ensure that we are doing all we can to protect New Hampshire's children and bring any person that would harm a child to justice.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse after the verdict was delivered on Feb. 22, Soreyessentially disowned Adam Montgomery from her daughter. Wearing a hoodie that read \"Harmony Renee,\" she told reporters her daughter is \"not a Montgomery.\"\n\n\"It's not over ... She's still out there so that's what I think about every day,\" Sorey said after the verdict was delivered. \"I hope that what he did plays over in his mind every single waking moment that he lives on this earth and I hope he never falls asleep without seeing her beautiful face.\"\n\nLess than a month later, Sorey asked Judge Beth Kissinger to have the state of New Hampshire declare Harmony Montgomery legally dead. The next day on March 12, Kissinger granted Sorey's request, WBZ News reported.\n\nHarmony was living with her mother when she was born in 2014, but shortly after Harmony was placed in a foster home. By 2018, Harmony was in Adam Montgomery's custody and she lived with him and his wife Kayla Montgomery. Adam Montgomery is believed to have taken a U-Haul van over around the Boston area and prosecutors think he dumped her body around the Revere/Saugus area.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com",

(WFLA) -- Adam Montgomery, the father of 5-year-old Harmony Montgomery, is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday after he was convicted of killing her about two years before she was reported missing by her mother in 2021.\n\nHarmony Montgomery's body has never been found.\n\nProsecutors are asking for Montgomery to be sentenced to 56 years to life, according to NBC Boston. He was not present at his trial. His sentencing is expected to begin at 1 p.m.\n\nHarmony Montgomery was in foster care while Adam Montgomery was in prison for armed robbery and armed assault. After his release, he was eventually granted custody in February 2019, following years of supervised visits.\n\nIn 2022, News Channel 8 spoke with Harmony Montgomery's uncle, Kevin Montgomery, who moved to New Port Richey in 2020.\n\n\"We loved her, a lot of us that loved her didn't have rights,\" Kevin Montgomery said. \"We didn't have rights to make the parental decisions.\"\n\nCourt documents say Kevin Montgomery contacted the New Hampshire Division for Children, Youth and Families in July 2019 after he observed Harmony with a black eye. He also told investigators he saw Harmony being \"forced to stand in the corner for hours\" and her father \"ordered her to scrub the toilet with her toothbrush.\"\n\nMontgomery was last seen in October 2019 while in the custody of her father, Adam Montgomery. Crystal Sorey, Harmony's mother, lost custody of her daughter in 2018 while struggling with substance abuse issues.\n\nIn December 2021, Manchester Police announced they had received a report of Harmony's disappearance, spurring a multi-state missing person investigation. Less than a week later, police arrested Adam Montgomery on charges related to failing to have Harmony in his custody.

Police believe Harmony was killed some two years before she was reported missing in 2021, and her body is still undiscovered.\n\nMontgomery was also convicted on charges of tampering with witnesses, falsifying physical evidence, abuse of a corpse, and second degree assault.\n\nIn the memo, prosecutors say Montgomery has never shown remorse for Harmony's death and that the murder was not a quick or impulsive act.\n\nThe state said at trial that Montgomery beat Harmony to death before he \"folded\" her body into a duffle bag and \"treated it with extreme temperatures and chemicals,\" according to the memo.

A jury found him guilty of second-degree murder earlier this year.\n\nThe 34-year-old is currently serving a minimum sentence of 32.5 years in prison on unrelated gun charges.\n\nAdam Montgomery ordered to be in court\n\nMontgomery was present on the first day of jury selection in February. But after that day, he never attended proceedings during his two-week trial.\n\nLast month, a judge ruled that Montgomery will be required to attend his sentencing. He appeared in court for the sentencing on Thursday.\n\nNew Hampshire state law says that in second-degree murder cases, \"The defendant shall personally appear in court when the victim or victim's next of kin addresses the judge, unless excused by the court.\"\n\nAdam Montgomery refuses to say where Harmony's body is\n\nProsecutors say Montgomery killed Harmony then moved her body around in the trunk of his car, in the ceiling vent of a homeless shelter, and in the walk-in freezer at the restaurant where he worked. Montgomery eventually disposed of his daughter's body in March 2020.\n\n\"There is nothing minimal about the crimes that he is being convicted for today,\" said the prosecutor at Montgomery's sentencing. He offered to reduce the request to 35 years to life, instead of 45 to life, if Montgomery revealed where Harmony's body could be found but Montgomery said nothing. \"He has just yet shown you again in this courtroom and for anybody else that he is heartless, immoral, selfish and an unapologetic murderer of his own child.\"\n\nVictim impact statements given\n\nThe first victim impact statement came from Crystal Sorey, Harmony's birth mother. \"She had a life worth living, unlike your own, and it bothered you to her core that she was nothing like you and everything like me,\" said Sorey, who addressed Montgomery as \"the monster who murdered my baby.\"\n\nSorey said her daughter lit up a room and was a proud big sister to her younger siblings. \"Did she cry for me? Did she scream? Did she beg you to stop? I'll never know because like I said, you're too much of a coward to tell the truth and do one good thing for Harmony,\" said Sorey.\n\n\"I hope that every day and every night you're on this earth, you hear nothing but my baby's giggle. I doubt you ever heard it in this life,\" said Sorey. \"All she knew with you was misery and fear. I hope you hear her sweet voice telling you to stop hitting her over and over, or how she looked the very last time you saw her, broken and bruised.\" Sorey vowed to keep looking for Harmony for the rest of her life.\n\nThe second victim impact statement was from Sorey's sister, who said Montgomery was in prison when Harmony was born. \"I was talking you down from how scared you were because you wanted to be the best dad and I believed in you and reminded you how good you were with my daughter, that you would be the best dad and not to worry. I couldn't even believe how wrong I actually was.\" She called Montgomery a monster and a coward and accused him of never loving his daughter, \"because if you did, she'd still be here today.\"\n\nA statement was also read by a victim advocate from Kayla Montgomery, Montgomery's estranged wife. Kayla Montgomery was a star witness for the prosecution, who testified how he killed Harmony and hid her body for months. Kayla Montgomery also testified she was scared of him and that's why she lied on his behalf to protect him.\n\nIn her statement, Kayla Montgomery said she and Montgomery were happy to have custody of Harmony but then everything changed when they fell deeper into addiction and their lives fell apart.\n\n\"You are not the person I married, not the person who loved me and who never hurt me,\" Kayla Montgomery said in her statement.\n\nBlair and Johnathan Miller, the adoptive fathers of Harmony's 7-year-old brother Jamison, spoke next. Johnathan Miller initially said the judge was limiting them from addressing the court, saying that making Jamison speak would retraumatize him. The judge eventually let both men speak on their son's behalf.\n\nBlair Miller said Jamison and Harmony were in and out of foster care together before he adopted him in 2019. He said when he and his husband first adopted Jamison, he would always tell them about his sister and her glasses and blonde hair and how she always looked out for him.\n\nBlair Miller said Jamison has suffered since learning his sister was dead and keeps asking \"Who took my sister away?\"\n\n\"Adam, you took away his best friend, his sister,\" said Blair Miller, addressing Montgomery. \"You introduced murder into his life and forever created a void that can never be filled.\" He said he and his husband have told Jamison that Harmony is an angel now.\n\nJohnathan Miller said Adam introduced a nightmare into his son's life. Through tears, he recounted Jamison's reaction to when he was told Harmony was dead. \"He's a very active kid and that day, he just stopped and he held us and he said, 'No, I need my big sister. Why? Why did this happen?'\" He said Jamison keeps asking what happened to her.\n\n\"How do we tell our 7-year-old that you murdered his sister? His protector, his best friend, and you showed no remorse. I wish they could be happy together today,\" said Johnathan Miller. He then read words from Jamison himself.\n\n\"I'm really sad she's an angel. I miss her. She was my best friend. I hope she can see me playing basketball, being silly with my brothers and I wish I could bring Harmony to my school to meet my friends and my teacher,\" read Johnathan Miller.\n\nThe final victim impact statement was from Harmony's foster mother. Michelle Raftery said Harmony filled her family's life with joy and laughter when she lived with them. She described Harmony as a kind and compassionate girl who loved Minnie Mouse and playing dress-up and was always willing to share. \"We lost a daughter and my children lost their sister,\" said Raftery.\n\nRaftery said since learning what happened to Harmony, she's had trouble sleeping and concentrating. \"We had to explain to our children things that we never wanted them to hear and explain why a father, who was supposed to love and protect her, was being arrested for murder,\" said Raftery.\n\nKey takeaways from Stormy Daniels' testimony in Trump trial\n\nWhat we learned from Stormy Daniels' testimony in Trump trial\n\nViolence erupts amid Kendrick Lamar and Drake feud", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_selection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury selection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insomnia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hKY495Bd0zmeOEOaqBfFcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cbs_news_articles_189/06e0145936a4e4b2b0b73a05bb05a3da", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 1352, "textEnd": 1362}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The defendant did nothing for Harmony after that attack. He did not attempt to treat her injuries or change her soiled clothes. He placed a blanket over her and went back to sleep.\"\n\nAlthough Investigators believe Harmony was slain in December 2019, she wasn't reported missing for almost two years. Kayla Montgomery, the girl's stepmother, testified that the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, Crystal Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to Manchester, New Hampshire Police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year's Eve 2021.\n\nPhotos of the girl were widely circulated on social media.

And it bothered you to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me.\"\n\nProsecutors are asking for 56 years to life.

State awaited a response from Adam Montgomery, but he did not respond.\n\n1:38 p.m.\n\nIn a dramatic moment, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ben Agati says that if Adam Montgomery were to say right now in court where he disposed of Harmony's remains such that police could find her within seven days, the state would recommend a lower sentence of 35 years to life, with the sentences on the other charges being served concurrently, rather than consecutively.\n\nThere was a long silent pause when Adam Montgomery said nothing.\n\n\"Since that offer has been rejected, your honor, that is yet another reason why the minimum should not apply,\" Agati said.\n\nThe public is seated.

Adam Montgomery is facing two additional trials, so a deal could be worked out related to those.\n\n10:39 a.m.\n\nNews 9 Investigates has learned that Adam Montgomery has arrived at the courthouse ahead of the sentencing hearing scheduled for 1 p.m. Until now, it was unclear whether he would show up for the hearing after he declined to appear for most of his murder trial.

I know he'll never give up her location, but I know I'll never give up. So I'll find her,\" Sorey said.\n\nAdam Montgomery was not in the courtroom for his trial, but a judge has ordered him to appear for sentencing.

The sentence would be served consecutively with the sentences that he's serving for unrelated gun charges.\n\nA New Hampshire jury found Montgomery, 34, guilty in February of second degree murder, second degree assault, falsifying physical evidence, abuse of a corpse and tampering with a witness and informants over the death of his five-year-old child.\n\nMontgomery has maintained his innocence.\n\nThe state has asked for no less than 56 years to life for Harmony's killing. But in court on Wednesday, prosecutors offered a reduced sentence -- a minimum of 35 years to life -- in exchange for Montgomery divulge \"where to recover\" her remains in the next seven days.\n\nBut the convicted murderer did not reply.\n\nHis silence was interpreted as a rejection. \"He has just shown you again in this courtroom that he is heartless, immoral and an unapologetic murderer of his own child,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nMontgomery's defense attorney Caroline Smith called the offer a \"stunt.\"\n\nShe argued that Montgomery's silence in response to the offer cannot be equated to a lack of remorse. \"Mr Montgomery does not have to express remorse here where he has maintained his innocence,\" arguing it violates his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nMs Smith said that the defendant can't offer an \"appropriate\" sentence since he has maintained his innocence and argued he would be \"worthy of rehabilitation.\"\n\nBefore making the offer, the state had argued that the gruesome nature of the crimes -- and the subsequent cover-up -- should eliminate the possibility of a minimum sentencing.\n\n\"How can the minimum [sentencing] ever apply...when she died in the car while he ate his food?\" The prosecutor added, \"How could the minimum ever apply when he could tell investigators where her body is right now...so she can be laid to rest?\"\n\n\"There is nothing minimal about the crimes that he's being convicted for today,\" the state said.\n\nLoved ones provided emotional victim impact statements to the court.\n\nCrystal Sorey, Harmony Montgomery's mother, was shaking and crying as she spoke. She called Adam Montgomery a \"monster,\" a \"coward,\" and \"just plain evil.\" She had a life worth living \"unlike your own.\"\n\n\"It bothered her to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me,\" the grieving mother said.\n\n\"Did she cry for me? Did she scream? Did she beg you to stop?\" Ms Sorey asked of her daughter's brutal death. \"I'll never know.\"\n\nShe promised to \"look for her til the end of my days.\"\n\nMs Sorey's sister also gave a victim impact statement, addressing Adam Montgomery the \"most vile person on the planet.\" She said he was a \"monster\" that pretended to be a father but actually \"traumatized\" his daughter.\n\nA victim impact statement for Montgomery's estranged wife, Kayla, was read in court on her behalf by a victim advocate.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" her statement began, explaining she needed \"closure.\"\n\nAlthough Kayla began by admitting that she will \"always have a place in her heart\" for Adam, she later accused him of \"physically and emotionally abusing\" her. She revealed that after she had been arrested, she started \"sleeping with a knife\" out of fear of what he might do to her.\n\nMost of her statement revolved around their romantic relationship and that she plans to fight to regain custody of their children.\n\nBlair Miller, the adopted father of Harmony's brother Jamison, also spoke to the court on behalf of his child.\n\n\"Jamison would constantly ask us, 'Where's Harmony?'\" Mr Miller said. \"Who took my sister away?\" He said, \"These are no questions for a little boy to be asking.\"\n\nThen addressing Montgomery, Blair said, \"Adam, you took away his best friend. You introduced murder into his life.\" He asked for the maximum sentence.\n\nIf there was a little girl with blonde hair, he would go up to the girl and ask if she was Harmony, Jonathon Bobbitt-Miller, Mr Miller's husband and Jamison's father, said.\n\n\"I hope I get to see her again,\" seven-year-old Jamsion said, according to a statement read by Mr Bobbitt-Miller. \"I love my sister. I miss her. I hope she's eating M&Ms in heaven. I hope her glasses are safe and not broken.\"\n\nThe convicted murderer had been ordered to appear in person for the sentencing on Wednesday after he refused to show up in court for the three-week-long murder trial.\n\nThe conviction came nearly five years after his daughter was killed -- although her body went undiscovered for two years. Authorities believe she died in November or December 2019.\n\nDuring Montgomery's trial, his defense attorney insisted that while Montgomery \"did horrible things\" to hide Harmony's body, he did not kill her.\n\nThe testimony of Kayla Montgomery, Adam's estranged wife, directly contradicted this claim, as she revealed harrowing details about the little girl's death.\n\nShe described how one day in the car, he became \"really angry from Harmony peeing in the car, and he repetitively kept punching her on the way to Burger King.\"\n\nThe attack killed her.\n\nKayla revealed that after realizing she was dead, her father tried to hide her remains in several places.\n\nShe testified that the five-year-old's corpse was first stored in a cooler at Kayla's mother's home before being relocated to a ceiling vent at a shelter the family had lived in, before Adam Montgomery started bringing the remains to work with him daily.\n\nThe horror didn't end there, however.\n\nKayla told the court began his efforts to dispose of his daughter's body in March 2021. She said her estranged husband contemplated using a handsaw, lime and even a NutriBullet to destroy Harmony's rotting remains.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether he actually executed his plan to use a Nutribullet, Kayla recalled seeing him with a \"large\" bag of limes in the bathroom.\n\n\"He said that he wanted to get rid of the body soon because he was scared of anything that could happen to him and the kids,\" she told the court.\n\nShe testified that Montgomery had asked Kayla to help him with his efforts to destroy his daughter's remains, but she refused.\n\nThe child's remains have never been found.\n\nMontgomery has already been serving a 32-year-sentence on unrelated charges.\n\nIn addition to the 45 years to life for murder, a judge ordered that Montgomery serve consecutive sentences in New Hampshire state prison for the other charges.\n\nHe was ordered to serve four to eight years for second degree assault, 12 months for abuse of a corpse, as well as three-and-a-half to seven years for both falsifying physical evidence and tampering with a witness and informants over the death of his five-year-old child.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-incrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-incrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/b2b66c33140bf479403a89131e7fe5f6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4922, "textEnd": 4935}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAdam Montgomery was sentenced to 45 years behind bars for second-degree murder after rejecting a lesser sentence in exchange for revealing where the remains of his daughter Harmony Montgomery are located.\n\nHe was charged with consecutive sentences.\n\nA New Hampshire jury found Montgomery, 34, guilty of second degree murder, second-degree assault, falsifying physical evidence, abuse of a corpse and tampering with a witness and informants over the death of his five-year-old child.\n\nMontgomery has maintained his innocence.\n\nThe state has asked for no less than 56 years to life for Harmony's killing. But in court on Wednesday, prosecutors offered a reduced sentence -- a minimum of 35 years to life -- in exchange for Montgomery divulge \"where to recover\" her remains in the next seven days.\n\nBut the convicted murderer did not reply.\n\nHis silence was interpreted as a rejection. \"He has just shown you again in this courtroom that he is heartless, immoral and an unapologetic murderer of his own child,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nMontgomery's defense attorney Caroline Smith called the offer a \"stunt.\"\n\nShe argued that Montgomery's silence in response to the offer cannot be equated to a lack of remorse. \"Mr Montgomery does not have to express remorse here where he has maintained his innocence,\" arguing it violates his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nMs Smith said that the defendant can't offer an \"appropriate\" sentence since he has maintained his innocence and argued he would be \"worthy of rehabilitation.\"\n\nBefore making the offer, the state had argued that the gruesome nature of the crimes -- and the subsequent cover-up -- should eliminate the possibility of a minimum sentencing.\n\n\"How can the minimum [sentencing] ever apply...when she died in the car while he ate his food?\" The prosecutor added, \"How could the minimum ever apply when he could tell investigators where her body is right now...so she can be laid to rest?\"\n\n\"There is nothing minimal about the crimes that he's being convicted for today,\" the state said.\n\nLoved ones provided emotional victim impact statements to the court.\n\nCrystal Sorey, Harmony Montgomery's mother, was shaking and crying as she spoke. She called Adam Montgomery a \"monster,\" a \"coward,\" and \"just plain evil.\" She had a life worth living \"unlike your own.\"\n\n\"It bothered her to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me,\" the grieving mother said.\n\n\"Did she cry for me? Did she scream? Did she beg you to stop?\" Ms Sorey asked of her daughter's brutal death. \"I'll never know.\"\n\nShe promised to \"look for her til the end of my days.\"\n\nMs Sorey's sister also gave a victim impact statement, addressing Adam Montgomery the \"most vile person on the planet.\" She said he was a \"monster\" that pretended to be a father but actually \"traumatized\" his daughter.\n\nA victim impact statement for Montgomery's estranged wife, Kayla, was read in court on her behalf by a victim advocate.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" her statement began, explaining she needed \"closure.\"\n\nAlthough Kayla began by admitting that she will \"always have a place in her heart\" for Adam, she later accused him of \"physically and emotionally abusing\" her. She revealed that after she had been arrested, she started \"sleeping with a knife\" out of fear of what he might do to her.\n\nMost of her statement revolved around their romantic relationship and that she plans to fight to regain custody of their children.\n\nBlair Miller, the adopted father of Harmony's brother Jamison, also spoke to the court on behalf of his child.\n\n\"Jamison would constantly ask us, 'Where's Harmony?'\" Mr Miller said. \"Who took my sister away?\" He said, \"These are no questions for a little boy to be asking.\"\n\nThen addressing Montgomery, Blair said, \"Adam, you took away his best friend. You introduced murder into his life.\" He asked for the maximum sentence.\n\nIf there was a little girl with blonde hair, he would go up to the girl and ask if she was Harmony, Jonathon Bobbitt-Miller, Mr Miller's husband and Jamison's father, said.\n\n\"I hope I get to see her again,\" seven-year-old Jamsion said, according to a statement read by Mr Bobbitt-Miller. \"I love my sister. I miss her. I hope she's eating M&Ms in heaven. I hope her glasses are safe and not broken.\"\n\nThe convicted murderer had been ordered to appear in person for the sentencing on Wednesday after he refused to show up in court for the three-week-long murder trial.\n\nThe conviction came nearly five years after his daughter was killed -- although her body went undiscovered for two years. Authorities believe she died in November or December 2019.\n\nDuring Montgomery's trial, his defense attorney insisted that while Montgomery \"did horrible things\" to hide Harmony's body, he did not kill her.\n\nThe testimony of Kayla Montgomery, Adam's estranged wife, directly contradicted this claim, as she revealed harrowing details about the little girl's death.\n\nShe described how one day in the car, he became \"really angry from Harmony peeing in the car, and he repetitively kept punching her on the way to Burger King.\"\n\nThe attack killed her.\n\nKayla revealed that after realizing she was dead, her father tried to hide her remains in several places.\n\nShe testified that the five-year-old's corpse was first stored in a cooler at Kayla's mother's home before being relocated to a ceiling vent at a shelter the family had lived in, before Adam Montgomery started bringing the remains to work with him daily.\n\nThe horror didn't end there, however.\n\nKayla told the court began his efforts to dispose of his daughter's body in March 2021. She said her estranged husband contemplated using a handsaw, lime and even a NutriBullet to destroy Harmony's rotting remains.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether he actually executed his plan to use a Nutribullet, Kayla recalled seeing him with a \"large\" bag of limes in the bathroom.\n\n\"He said that he wanted to get rid of the body soon because he was scared of anything that could happen to him and the kids,\" she told the court.\n\nShe testified that Montgomery had asked Kayla to help him with his efforts to destroy his daughter's remains, but she refused.\n\nThe child's remains have never been found.\n\nMontgomery has already been serving a 32-year-sentence on unrelated charges.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_defense_lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal defense lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-incrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-incrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Informant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehabilitation (penology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/02/09/19/0da68afb12ee4e8c9e0623b922f67116.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4747, "textEnd": 4760}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

(WHDH) - Adam Montgomery was sentenced to 45 years to life in prison Thursday for the murder of his five-year-old daughter, Harmony Montgomery.\n\nRoughly three months after a jury found him guilty, Montgomery also received lesser sentences for lesser charges in the case.\n\nBefore his sentencing near 3 p.m., several people delivered victim impact statements.\n\n\"Did she cry for me?\" asked Harmony's biological mother, Crystal Sorey, during her statement. \"Did she scream? Did she beg you to stop? I'll never know.\"\n\nHarmony was reported missing in 2021. In court, prosecutors said they believed she died nearly two years earlier, in December 2019, after Adam beat her while in his car following a bathroom accident.\n\nMontgomery was charged with second-degree murder second-degree assault, witness tampering, falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse. A jury found him guilty in February of this year.\n\nMontgomery's estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery testified in his trial, saying Harmony's body was hidden before Adam eventually disposed of it.\n\nKayla was Harmony's stepmother. She pleaded guilty to a perjury charge in connection with the investigation into Harmony's murder and testified against Adam as part of her plea deal. Sorey also testified in Adam's murder trial.\n\nThough Adam's attorneys said he did not kill Harmony, his attorneys at one point acknowledged their client's guilt on charges that he \"purposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed\" Harmony's corpse and falsified physical evidence.\n\nHarmony's body has never been found.\n\nSorey was seen arriving at Hillsborough County Superior Court in Manchester near 12:45 p.m. Thursday. She stopped to speak with Manchester Chief of Police Allen Aldenberg before entering the building.\n\nAhead of Thursday's hearing, prosecutors asked that Montgomery receive a sentence of 56 years to life in prison for his crimes, according to court documents.\n\nSpeaking in court, the prosecution said it would amend its recommendation to the minimum of 35 years to life if Adam told authorities where he hid Harmony's body and if authorities were able to recover the body within the next seven days.\n\nAfter silence, the prosecutor told the judge \"that is yet another reason why the minimum should not apply.\"\n\nSoon taking the microphone, Sorey recalled Harmony, saying she loved her brother and loved Adam's sons.\n\n\"Did she cry for me?\" Sorey asked. \"Did she scream? Did she beg you to stop? I'll never know.\"\n\n\"You may have taken her physically from me, but she is always, always with me,\" Sorey said.\n\nShe vowed to keep looking for Harmony, saying \"with or without you, we will find my daughter.\"\n\nAdam's defense, after victim impact statements, said Adam maintains his innocence. Adam's defense called the prosecution's offer to reduce its recommendation in exchange for information \"a stunt\" and said the judge should not make an \"adverse inference of lack of remorse\" based on his silence.\n\n\"Adam Montgomery did not kill his daughter,\" Adam's attorney said. \"But when he discovered his daughter's death, he broke and he did inexplicable things. Even he can't explain his actions. But eventually, he pulled it together and he was able to say goodbye to his daughter.\"\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n45 to life for murder\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Jamison's adoptive fathers are hoping to give a full victim impact statement on the 7 year old's behalf.\n\nThe adoptive fathers of Harmony Montgomery's brother are fighting for a chance to offer a complete victim-impact statement at the sentencing of convicted killer Adam Montgomery, who they call a \"monster\" for brutally beating his young daughter to death in 2019.\n\nBlair Miller and Johnathon Bobbitt-Miller say the state is denying their son Jamison's right to have them speak on his behalf at Thursday afternoon's hearing.\n\nInstead, Miller said, the state wants them to read a statement from their 7-year-old son, who does not know the details of the murder.\n\n\"We will always fight for both Jamison and Harmony,\" Miller wrote in a statement. \"Harmony was silenced forever in New Hampshire. Now they want to silence Jamison by limiting our ability to speak on his behalf. A child victim should not be treated with such cruelty.\"\n\nThe state Department of Justice cited a statute saying statements need to be a \"reflection of the victim's words or other expressions of their feelings.\" The department offered to let Jamison share his thoughts either in writing or video to be read aloud during the hearing.\n\nThe department said the fathers also wish to offer their own statement, which isn't permitted by the statute.\n\n\"In accordance with their request, we are bringing the materials they wish to read to the Court's attention prior to the hearing, so the Court may determine how it will review their materials,\" the statement says.\n\nMiller says state law allows a victim to designate a representative to write or speak on the victim's behalf. The two testified in Massachusetts on the formation of a \"Harmony Commission\" to study and make recommendations related to the welfare and best interests of children in protection cases.\n\n\"The whole purpose of a statute like that is to have someone speak and represent a person not of an age able to speak or has a disability,\" said retired Juvenile Court Judge Carol Erskine, who finalized Jamison's adoption in November 2019. \"I'm just stunned by taking a position that they can't be in their court and tell Adam Montgomery just how the murder of Harmony impacted Jamison's life.\"\n\nThe couple says Jamison often speaks of Harmony and now says she is in heaven.\n\n\"Jamison is only 7 years old and only knows that Harmony has died. He has no idea of the circumstances of Harmony's death,\" Erskine said.\n\nLooking at 56 years\n\nProsecutors want Adam Montgomery sentenced to 56 years to life in prison for convictions of second-degree murder, second-degree assault, falsifying physical evidence, tampering with witnesses and abuse of a corpse.\n\nDuring the trial, Kayla Montgomery, Adam's wife and Harmony's stepmother, testified that Adam Montgomery repeatedly struck the little girl after a bathroom accident in the car they were living in on Dec. 7, 2019. The Montgomerys' two young sons also were in the car.\n\n\"The murder was not a quick, impulsive act,\" prosecutors wrote. \"Each time the defendant struck Harmony, he had an opportunity to stop.\"\n\nThe Millers have been outspoken on social media for years about the impact the murder has had on their family.\n\n\"As Jamison's 2 adopted Dads, we must be his voice,\" Bobbitt-Miller wrote on X. \"It's unbelievable a 'court rule' will not let us tell Adam the pain he has caused our son.\"\n\nJamison is Harmony's half-brother with the same mother, Crystal Sorey.\n\nSorey, who testified at trial, is expected to offer an impact statement Thursday.\n\nAdam Montgomery refused to attend the majority of his trial, but has been ordered by Judge Amy Messer to appear in person Thursday afternoon.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_phelps@unionleader.com", "name": "Jonathan Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victim_impact_statement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victim impact statement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juvenile court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heaven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/unionleader.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/37/837cfb3a-0d71-11ef-8357-cf951334964e/663bd2fa0648b.image.jpg?crop=1081%2C568%2C0%2C454&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-07", "textStart": 2938, "textEnd": 2950}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-11-", "textStart": 2112, "textEnd": 2125}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Here's everything we know", "body": "Although her life was short, documents show that Harmony Montgomery endured an extraordinarily difficult childhood. Her mother struggled with substance abuse issues, meaning Harmony bounced in and out of foster homes -- until she was put in the custody of her father in February 2019.\n\nDespite having a violent criminal history and spending only 40 hours across 20 supervised visits with his daughter from the time she was born to age four and a half, he was awarded custody.\n\nAround 10 months later, she was dead.\n\nShe slipped through the cracks of the systems in place across two states, with agencies missing crucial safety and background checks, begging the question of whether Harmony would still be alive today had those systems not failed her.\n\nTo add insult to injury, authorities didn't start looking for her body until two years after she died.\n\nIt wasn't until December 2021 that Montgomery was charged with second-degree assault. One year after that, in October 2022, he was charged with murder.\n\nDuring Montgomery's trial, his defence attorney insisted that while Montgomery \"did horrible things\" to hide Harmony's body, he did not kill her.\n\nAfter all this time, Montgomery has still maintained his innocence in the death of his daughter.\n\nBut the New Hampshire jury didn't buy it, finding the father guilty of second-degree murder in February.\n\nNow, on May 9, he is scheduled to appear in court for his sentencing.\n\nKayla, Adam's estranged wife, had already been sentenced to 18 months in prison on perjury charges for initially lying to law enforcement regarding Harmony's whereabouts.\n\nAlthough the defence team tried to paint Kayla as a \"liar,\" the prosecution argued that she was afraid of disclosing the truth because she was being abused and threatened by Adam Montgomery.\n\n\"Adam was getting really angry from Harmony peeing in the car, and he repetitively kept punching her on the way to Burger King,\" Kayla told jurors while sobbing.\n\nShe said when they stopped driving at red lights, Adam \"would go over the driver's seat in between the passenger seat, and he was just punching her repetitively in the head.\"\n\nHarmony's body was moved several times, Kayla told the court.\n\nThe five-year-old's corpse was first stored in a cooler at Kayla's mother's home. Then it was relocated to a ceiling vent at a shelter the family had lived in.\n\n\"He compressed and contorted her body into this bag,\" the prosecution said at his murder trial while showing a medium-sized tote bag.\n\nProsecutors said that when investigators scoped out the room two years later, they saw deep blood stains in the ceiling vent and smelled decomposition.\n\n\"And surrounding Harmony's blood, all that was left of her .... the defendant's fingerprints and palm prints, froze in there for a time,\" the prosecution said.\n\nNeighbours started to complain about the smell, prosecutors said during the trial. So, Montgomery then began bringing Harmony's remains to work with him every day; he then worked as a cook and dishwasher at the since-closed Portland Pie Company.\n\n\"[The bag] stood out to people, because he placed it in the freezer during his shifts,\" a prosecutor said. \"He brought it with him regularly to work and he stored it in a freezer where the company kept food and ingredients. People saw him bringing that in and out. They couldn't have imagined what that bag contained.\"\n\nHow Montgomery allegedly disposed of the body\n\nMontgomery started his efforts to destroy his daughter's body in March 2021, Kayla testified.\n\nAs Kayla's testimony continued, the details became even more gruesome.\n\nShe recalled Montgomery discussing using a handsaw, lime and even a NutriBullet to destroy Harmony's rotting remains.\n\nMontgomery spent hours inside the bathroom \"dethawing\" Harmony's frozen remains, cutting the clothes off the body, and running hot water on to what remained of the little girl, Kayla testified.\n\n\"He wanted to use a handsaw and a NutriBullet,\" Kayla told the court. \"He said that'd be good to use to help get rid of her ... I saw Harmony folded together the same way she was when we took her out of the car. She looked like she had barely any skin, just skin and bones and was very bruised. He had the hot water running ... in the tub.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether he actually went through with the Nutribullet plan. However, Kayla testified that he had a \"large\" bag of lime in the bathroom.\n\n\"He said that he wanted to get rid of the body soon because he was scared of anything that could happen to him and the kids,\" she told the court.\n\nMontgomery asked Kayla to help him with his efforts to destroy his daughter's remains, she testified, but she didn't go through with it.\n\nAt some point, she said, Montgomery placed the remains back in the tote bag and inside the freezer again.\n\nAdam was accused of second-degree assault for hitting his daughter in the face while Kayla was accused of theft by deception for fraudulently obtaining $1,500 in food stamp benefits meant for Harmony between December 2019 and June 2021, despite the fact that the little girl was not living with her.\n\nIn April 2022, both Montgomerys faced unrelated charges related to the theft of firearms.\n\nMonths later, in June, Kayla was arrested for perjury charges. She told a grand jury that she was working at the time when Harmony was last seen alive.\n\nSpeaking to authorities in June, court documents show that she accused her husband of murdering his daughter. The filing said that Kayla divulged to police that Adam had encouraged her to lie about Harmony's whereabouts, \"basically giving Kayla a 'cover story' and telling her that as long as she stuck to the cover story everything would be OK.\"\n\nIt wasn't until October of that year that Adam faced murder charges.\n\nOne month later, in November 2022, Kayla pleaded guilty to perjury charges.\n\nIn exchange, she agreed to testify at her estranged husband's murder trial.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_rissman@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Kelly Rissman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Begging the question"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_saw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hand saw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decomposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishwasher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dishwasher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_Nutrition_Assistance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/f84b04fda46f62b6b601696dd518fd91", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1373}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 283}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 4994, "textEnd": 5007}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

These are all the systems that failed her", "body": "The storm of unfortunate events that led to a Massachusetts court awarding custody of Harmony Montgomery to her father would eventually prove fatal.\n\nFor the first four years of her life, Harmony's childhood had been a lot like her little brother Jamison's. They were born two years apart to a mother who was actively struggling with substance abuse issues and constantly found themselves in and out of foster homes.\n\n\"The trauma that they had been through at a very young age ... All they really had was each other. Harmony was Jamison's only constant,\" Blair Miller, who adopted Jamison along with his husband Jonathon Bobbitt-Miller, tells The Independent.\n\nJamison officially became a Miller in November 2019 and a week later, the family gathered to celebrate the little boy's birthday at their Boston home. That same weekend, just over 50 miles away in Manchester, New Hampshire, Harmony was killed. She was five years old.\n\n\"All I can think of is, 'Gosh, we were celebrating Jamison's birthday when Harmony was being beaten in the back of a car,\" Mr Miller said.\n\nThe Millers had inquired about adopting Harmony, a rambunctious little girl with an infectious grin who was blind in her right eye, but were told that would not be possible. The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) informed the family that Harmony had been reunited with her biological father, Adam Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery was found guilty by a jury in late February of beating Harmony to death after she had a bathroom accident.\n\nA constellation of missed warning signs, systemic failures, inconsistent laws across two states, and vague policies resulted in Harmony being placed in the hands of her father, who had a violent criminal history and was in jail at the time she was born.\n\n\"It was one decision after another that put her on a path of lethality with her father,\" Carol Erskine, a Massachusetts child advocate, juvenile court judge, and author of an upcoming book about Harmony Montgomery told The Independent.\n\nFrom June 2014, when DCF opened the case, to February 2019, when her father was awarded custody of Harmony, the DCF case management team never completed an assessment of him, the Massachusetts Office of the Child Advocate (OCA) noted.\n\nJust 40 hours of visitation and an extensive criminal history\n\nPerhaps if a proper assessment of Adam Montgomery had been conducted, agencies would have noticed his lengthy criminal history, which includes everything from robbery to armed assault.\n\n\"There was just a list of dangerous crimes that made him a clear risk, in my opinion, to being able to parent their child,\" Ms Erskine said.\n\nThe former judge explained that when determining the placement of a child, a judge will only consider a criminal past if the crimes are \"relevant.\" For example, \"when there's a record of ongoing unabated violence, with weapons and crimes against individuals, then it becomes more relevant in terms of parenting.\"\n\nAnother red flag appears to have been ignored when deciding to award Harmony's father custody: the lack of time he had spent with her during her life.\n\n\"Mr Montgomery was in and out of Harmony's life since birth, not consistently visiting with her for more than four to six months at a time, with long periods of no contact,\" the Massachusetts OCA's 2022 report states. One gap between Montgomery's visits to Harmony spanned 11 months.\n\nThe OCA estimated that the child had spent 40 hours across 20 supervised visits with her father from the time she was born to age four and a half. The report also noted that there is no evidence that her father tried to \"understand or accommodate\" her visual impairment or the emotional trauma she already had endured in her young life.\n\nMs Erskine laid out a series of issues in court when Montgomery was awarded custody. The DCF attorney, while opposed to Adam being awarded custody of Harmony, did not pursue important lines of inquiry -- like his parental capacity, job stability, housing situation, or understanding of her visual impairment -- according to the Massachusetts report. Because DCF's case was \"extremely weak,\" the judge didn't hear substantial relevant evidence, Ms Erskine said.\n\nOn top of this, Harmony didn't have a court-appointed child advocate. \"If there had been an independent voice for Harmony, things might have been very different because the judge might have heard information that was not conveyed to the court by the lawyers,\" Ms Erskine added.\n\nRegardless of the dearth of information, the judge awarded Adam Montgomery full custody.\n\n\"This was a case that was open with the court for four years and eight months and the trial lasted somewhere between six and eight hours,\" Ms Erskine added. At the same time, Harmony's mother Crystal Sorey had a scheduling conflict in a different court regarding the care and protection of Jamison, Harmony's half-brother. Harmony's hearing therefore proceeded without her mother.\n\nHarmony was then sent to live with her father in New Hampshire.\n\nInterstate issues played big role in lack of safety checks\n\nMoving to another state opened the floodgates for more missed warning signs.\n\nMs Erskine said that \"the major problem\" in the case is that there are different interpretations by Massachusetts and New Hampshire of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) -- which is a law enacted across all 50 states that requires check-ins about the child's welfare.\n\nThe ICPC requires an investigation, including a criminal background check and a home study.\n\nThe Massachusetts juvenile court judge requested an expedited ICPC to analyse what placing Harmony in Adam Montgomery's care -- in another state -- would look like. However, the Massachusetts report said that the New Hampshire ICPC Compact Administrator had not acted on the ICPC request by the date of the February 2019 hearing.\n\nSo, \"Harmony was placed in the custody of Mr. Montgomery without a completed ICPC,\" the Massachusetts report states.\n\nCassandra Sanchez, a child advocate at the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate (OCA), explained that Massachusetts had sent an ICPC request to be completed by New Hampshire but some documents were missing.\n\n\"The sending state is the one that needs to follow up,\" she said. Ms Sanchez also worked at the Massachusetts OCA during the Montgomery case. She said it was \"surprising\" that the judge \"moved forward with placement of the child to a parent before that was completed.\" There was never a home study at Adam Montgomery's house.\n\nUltimately, the judge determined that the ICPC did not apply, and the DCF attorney -- the only attorney to argue that the ICPC applied to Harmony's case -- did not appeal that decision, the Massachusetts report states.\n\nWhen the ICPC didn't happen, it \"left Harmony alone in a home with a man who had a dangerous, violent criminal past,\" Ms Erskine said.\n\nThe beginning of the end for Harmony Montgomery\n\nIt only took months after Harmony moved in with her father for abuse allegations to surface.\n\nIn July 2019, Kevin Montgomery, Adam's uncle, reported that Harmony had been abused after seeing a black eye on the little girl -- and said that her father had admitted to causing it.\n\n\"I bashed her around this house,\" Kevin said Adam had told him. The uncle said he contacted DCYF and had also noticed that Adam had subjected his daughter to other forms of \"abusive discipline,\" like scrubbing a toilet with her toothbrush and being \"spanked hard on the butt\".\n\nMichael Montgomery, Adam's brother, also told investigators he \"had concerns that Adam was physically abusive\" to the child and was \"super short\" with her.\n\nNew Hampshire DCYF visited the home the same day as the call and determined the claim to be unfounded. However, as the New Hampshire report notes, the DCYF worker only saw the child for a fleeting moment: \"This assessment was conducted as Adam Montgomery and Harmony were entering their vehicle and departing.\"\n\nA few weeks later, in August, when the worker conducted a second, \"more detailed assessment,\" they noticed a red mark in her eye and faded bruising under her eyelid, the report says. Harmony, her father and his wife, Kayla Montgomery, all told the worker that the child had been accidentally hit with a toy lightsaber while playing with a sibling.\n\nAfter yet another assessment in October 2019, the worker rated the situation as \"high risk\" for future child welfare involvement.\n\nPolice have narrowed down the window when Harmony Montgomery would have died to between late November and early December 2019.\n\nAt the trial, the court heard graphic details of the little girl's death. According to the testimony of her stepmother, Harmony was beaten to death after she soiled herself but Montgomery and his estranged wife Kayla did not realize she was dead for hours. Kayla was the star witness at Adam's trial after reaching a plea deal on unrelated charges of perjury. She is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence and has not been charged with any offence against Harmony.\n\nThe little girl made \"weird moaning noises,\" according to Kayla, as she lay in the back of the car after the beating. Her severely bruised, tiny body was covered under a blanket and her face was dirty with blood from beatings in the days before.\n\nAdam and Kayla drove to a Burger King and then to a friend's apartment complex to buy drugs before they realized Harmony was not breathing, Kayla said. For the next two months, Adam Montgomery went to horrific lengths to reduce Harmony's remains before he disposed of what was left of her in March 2020.\n\nStill, two years on from her death, no authorities were even looking for Harmony.\n\nIn January 2020, the New Hampshire DCYF received yet another report about the Montgomery household; Adam Montgomery informed the agency that Harmony was not there, and instead was living with her mother in Massachusetts.\n\nDCYF proceeded to try to get in touch with Crystal Sorey to no avail. Both state reports say that she did not return their one call and voicemail attempting to contact her.\n\nAt this time, \"There was not a strict guideline in place at the time for [DCYF] to have to connect with the parents they made attempts,\" Ms Sanchez explained.\n\nThe Montgomery household received numerous child welfare reports from January through March 2021 - none of these complaints pertained to Harmony. When agents asked about Harmony's whereabouts, Adam Montgomery said that she was with her mother and he hadn't seen his daughter in a year, state reports say.\n\nStrangely, both state reports make no mention of the little girl from March 2020 -- when agents tried, unsuccessfully, to contact Ms Sorey -- until a year and a half later in September 2021. The gap underscores that seemingly no one had been trying to keep tabs on the little girl in that time frame, despite neither agency being able to confirm where she was staying.\n\nIt wasn't until September 2021, when someone close to Ms Sorey inquired to the New Hampshire child welfare agency about Harmony, that anything was done. That person said that the child's mother hadn't seen her daughter since Easter 2019 and hadn't been able to get in contact with Adam Montgomery to visit with her daughter.\n\nIt also wasn't until this time that New Hampshire's child welfare agency confirmed that Harmony had never been registered for school in the state. At that point, she would have been seven years old.\n\nSo, in December 2021, the search for the girl began, with agencies believing they were looking for a missing seven-year-old. On December 31, the same day that police publicized Harmony's disappearance, New Hampshire officers found the little girl's father living in his car. When asked about where his daughter was, he provided \"contradictory\" explanations, reports say.\n\nDays later, he was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, interference with custody and endangering the welfare of a child.\n\nIn October 2022, Adam Montgomery was charged with murder. More than four years later, Harmony's body has yet to be found.\n\nBlair Miller and his husband watched Montgomery's trial with \"an eye open\" and the other closed, he told The Independent before the jury reached a verdict on Thursday. Naturally, a child murder case was slated to have its share of grim details, but the information that emerged during the two-and-a-half weeks of proceedings proved disturbing beyond comprehension.\n\nDuring closing arguments, prosecutor Ben Agati's voice cracked with anger and outrage.\n\n\"The only parts of Harmony that are left will be with you in that deliberation room, on that pink toothbrush, and on that part of [bloodied] ceiling wall,\" Mr Agati told jurors before deliberations began on Wednesday, of the last objects known to contain Harmony's DNA. \"And the other parts of her body, her torso, her face, her eyes, that smile ... only the defendant, as we sit and stand here today, knows where they are. He can't afford to say where they are, because the evidence contained on them will show that he caused her death, so she won't get the burial that she deserves.\"\n\nAlthough Harmony's body was abused in unimaginable ways, her legacy lives on in her little brother. After he was adopted by the Millers, Jamison looked for Harmony in every blonde little girl he saw while out with his parents and siblings.\n\n\"We were talking to his mom about trying to figure out where exactly Harmony was because Jamison was so determined to want to keep that relationship. He would ask about her a lot. We'd be at a park and he'd say that's Harmony, off in the distance,\" Mr Miller said. \"As a dad, you want to help fix that situation.\"\n\nThe Millers would have gladly adopted Harmony. When they were told Jamison had a sister, they reached out to Montgomery via Facebook messages about being told that she was living with her biological father, but they never heard back.\n\n\"We had always said, 'If anything changes, we would want to keep them together,\" Mr Miller said. \"We feel a lot of guilt from that because we wish we could have done more. We wish we would have pushed harder. We were trying to keep a relationship between Jamison and his sister.\"\n\nJamison is not yet aware of the horrifying abuse his sister endured but understands that Harmony is no longer alive. His fathers welcome conversations about Harmony and have tried to fill in the gaps with age-appropriate information.\n\nOn Jamison's bedroom door, the Millers have placed a picture of him and Harmony. In the photo, they're both smiling. Harmony is wearing her round glasses and a shirt featuring Minnie Mouse, her favourite cartoon. Jamison is holding a stuffed animal tight in his hands. It's a frozen moment in time of the special bond they once shared, before Harmony's life was taken and Jamison's was irreparably changed.\n\n\"He's still very much talks about his relationship with Harmony and what she means to him,\" said Mr Miller. \"Just the other night, he was saying during his evening prayers ... 'I pray to God that he could just do one thing and that's to bring Harmony back to life.'\"\n\n'What has been done so there's not another Harmony?'\n\nThere have been some changes implemented to address the wide range of missteps that occurred in Harmony's case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Massachusetts OCA told The Independent that its child welfare agency decreased the caseloads of its staff attorneys. Similarly, the New Hampshire OCA said its child welfare agency workers now have a more manageable caseload that is \"closer to the [proposed] national standards,\" Ms Sanchez said.\n\nSince this case, New Hampshire has also put in place new policies for how children are evaluated after the child welfare agency receives a report. New Hampshire child welfare agents are now required to see children within a certain time frame and ensure they are \"directly laying eyes on the child and not seeing a child in passing\", Ms Sanchez said. Hopefully, this will avoid another fleeting moment where an agent spotted Harmony from afar while she got in a car. The agents are also required \"to sit down and meet with the child separate from the parent and potential perpetrator,\" she added.\n\nThere are also tighter definitions pertaining to the child-parent relationship.\n\nOn top of this, seemingly in order to address Adam Montgomery being awarded custody after seeing his daughter for just 40 hours, Massachusetts and New Hampshire have signed a memorandum of understanding requiring parents to prove that they have a pre-existing relationship with a child.\n\nIf the parent and child don't have a pre-existing relationship or it can't be proven, then the two states have agreed that the parent will undergo a home study process, Ms Sanchez explained.\n\nAfter Adam Montgomery told the New Hampshire child welfare agency that Harmony was living with her mother, the agency tried contacting Ms Sorey once -- without follow-up. Now, the agency is required to continue to try to get in touch with the parent until they connect and are able to validate the whereabouts of the child. If that parent says they don't have the child, the agents must then \"take steps to seek out where else that child may be,\" Ms Sanchez said.\n\nWhile some state policies have been addressed, Ms Erskine has her sights set on changing federal legislation. She hopes to alter the language of the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act to make a home study and follow-up mandatory in the cases in which a child is to be with a parent in another state.\n\nThe New Hampshire legislature announced in February that it had started the \"Harmony Commission.\" The House Speaker said that a \"committee on the Division for Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) is charged with considering all matters on due process and practices concerning DCYF\" and can \"make recommendations for future legislation.\" Ms Sanchez said the commission seems like it will explore \"parents' rights and their due process. And for us, that's the opposite of what we need to be looking at right now.\" She added, \"Children's needs need to be at the forefront.\"\n\n\"It comes back to ... what's going to happen? After this verdict, what are we going to do?\" Mr Miller told The Independent. \"I know people are outraged but how do we harness that into creating change so there's not another Harmony?\"\n\nAt the Miller household, Harmony is a central focus. The couple has met with lawmakers in Massachusetts and DC to discuss potential ways to avoid history repeating itself.\n\nEvery year, the Millers celebrate Harmony's June 8th birthday. It's a tradition that dates back to when she was reported missing.\n\nLast year, they held the celebration at the Potomac River in DC.\n\n\"Jamison said, 'Let's get some flowers and go put them in the river,\" Mr Miller recounted. \"He said, 'All rivers eventually lead to heaven.' He wanted the flowers to reach her.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_rissman@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Kelly

Police believe she was killed nearly two years before she was reported missing in 2021. Her body was never found.\n\nA prosecutor offered to lessen the sentence for the second-degree murder conviction and other charges if Montgomery \"tells us right now\" the location of his daughter's remains. Montgomery, who has maintained his innocence in the death of his daughter, did not speak in the Manchester courtroom. His attorney later called the offer a \"stunt\" and said Montgomery's silence should not be interpreted as a lack of remorse.\n\nPeople who knew Harmony Montgomery spoke about the happy, kind child they once knew.\n\n\"She had a life worth living, unlike your own,\" Crystal Sorey, Harmony's mother, read from a statement addressing Adam Montgomery, her hands shaking. \"And it bothered you to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me.\"\n\nSorey added, \"I will forever look for her until the end of my days. But I hope that every day and every night here on this earth, you hear nothing but my baby's giggle.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parents who adopted Harmony's brother, now 7, spoke on his behalf. \"I'm really sad she's an angel. I miss her,\" they quoted him as saying.\n\nMontgomery did not attend his trial in February. He was ordered by the judge to be in court Thursday after his lawyer asked for him to be excused. Montgomery also had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree assault and witness tampering. He had admitted to abuse of acorpse and falsifying evidence.\n\nJudge Amy Messer noted that Montgomery had an extensive criminal record that dates back to 2008 and that he had extensive opportunities to change his life.\n\n\"Your extreme indifference to the value of human life is seen in so many of your actions,\" she said.\n\nMesser said the only way to keep Montgomery from hurting others is to keep him off the streets. \"To the extent you seek to rehabilitate yourself, that will have to happen behind the prison walls,\" she said.\n\nAn email seeking comment on the sentence and asking about a possible appeal was sent to Montgomery's lawyer, Caroline Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, had testified that her family, including her two young sons with Adam Montgomery, had been evicted right before Thanksgiving in 2019 and were living in a car. She said on Dec. 7, Adam Montgomery punched Harmony Montgomery at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant because he was angry that the child was having bathroom accidents in the car.\n\nAfter that, she said she handed food to the children in the car without checking on Harmony Montgomery and that the couple later discovered she was dead after the car broke down. She testified that her husband put the body in a duffel bag. She described various places where the girl's body was hidden, including the trunk of a car, a cooler, a homeless center ceiling vent and the walk-in freezer at her husband's workplace.\n\nDuring Adam Montgomery's trial, his lawyers suggested that Kayla continued to lie to protect herself. They said their client did not kill Harmony, and that Kayla Montgomery was the last person to see the child alive.\n\nKayla Montgomery testified that she didn't come forward about the child's death because she was afraid of her husband. She said Adam Montgomery suspected that she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021.\n\nKayla Montgomery was recently granted parole. She is expected to be released from prison soon after serving an 18-month sentence. She pleaded guilty to perjury charges related to the investigation into the child's disappearance and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\n\"I will forever have a place in my heart for you,\" Kayla Montgomery said in a statement read in court on her behalf. But she talked about how their relationship spiraled out of control after Harmony died. \"The last couple of nights after you got arrested for the first time, I was sleeping with a knife because I did not know what you were going to do to me,\" she wrote, adding, \"I'm so angry and hurt by you.\"\n\nAdam Montgomery had custody of the girl. Her mother, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony Montgomery was during a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year's Eve 2021. Adam and Kayla Montgomery told police that Adam had taken his daughter to live with Sorey in Massachusetts.\n\nHarmony Montgomery's case has exposed weaknesses in child protection systems and provoked calls to prioritize the well-being of children over parents in custody matters. Harmony was moved between the homes of her mother and her foster parents multiple times before Adam Montgomery received custody in 2019 and moved to New Hampshire.\n\nAuthorities plan to keep searching for the girl's remains, believed to be along a route Adam Montgomery drove in a rental truck into Massachusetts in March 2020. Prosecutor Benjamin Agati said Thursday that police last went out for a search a couple of weeks ago, but they were not successful.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nfiled under: new hampshire Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "sunjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lewiston Sun Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Montgomery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montgomery, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_tampering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witness tampering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methadone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methadone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traffic light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foster care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/sunjournal-social.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547437", "eventUri": "eng-9547437", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-07", "textStart": 2824, "textEnd": 2830}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 4836, "textEnd": 4846}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 5551, "textEnd": 5561}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 452990413, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 67, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 67}}}

A few beats of pure silence passed.\n\n\"Since that offer has been rejected your honor, that is yet another reason why the minimum should not apply,\" Senior Assistant Attorney General Ben Agati said. \"What I just said was not a stunt, it was not a theatrical event. I stated, in closing arguments, that there are moments in life when we are tested; where our failure or our success lies in whether we do the right thing at that moment in time. And time and time again -- and about 30 seconds ago -- the defendant chose again to be heartless, and immoral, and selfish and unapologetic.\"\n\nOn Feb. 22, Adam Mongtomery was convicted of Harmony's murder -- following a trial that the defendant wholly declined to attend.\n\nNot attending to face the allegations was his right as a criminal defendant. That aspect of the high-profile case, however, prompted Granite State legislators to pass a law requiring people convicted of the most serious felonies to attend their sentencing hearings.\n\nOn Thursday, the condemned man sat through several victim impact statements that excoriated him as a \"monster\" and more during his sentencing hearing broadcast by Manchester-based ABC affiliate WMUR.\n\nHarmony's mother, Crystal Sorey, who lost and regained custody of her daughter due to substance abuse problems throughout the girl's too-short life, took the defendant to task for his previously-expressed desire to defend himself in court and \"refute\" the \"offensive\" allegations against him.\n\n\"She had a life worth living,\" Sorey said, bitterly, through ever-present tears. \"Unlike your own. And it bothered you to your core that she was nothing like you and everything like me. Beautiful inside and out. Funny. Smart. Sassy. Loving. And, most of all, kind. She wasn't a coward like you. And I'll be forever grateful for that. You're a coward who has to be in charge of everything and everyone around you. Insecure. And paranoid -- the list goes on. She was none of those things. She lit up a room when she walked in. She made a mark wherever she went. And you couldn't stand it.\"\n\nThe defendant also heard from his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" she said in a letter read aloud by a victim advocate. \"I don't know about you but I need some kind of closure. I'll forever have a place in my heart for you whether you believe me or not. You were my best friend, my husband, the person I chose to spend the rest of my life with ... by the time Thanksgiving came around in the year 2019, we were losing everything. My job, our place to live, and after living in a car for a few weeks, we lost that. At the same time, Harmony dies because of your anger and hitting her so many times.\"\n\nAdam Montgomery has consistently maintained his innocence. And, though he never attended his trial, or spoke up during the hearing, his defense attorney reiterated that position on Thursday -- while saying the prosecutor's offer was, in fact, a \"stunt\" intended to elicit a reaction and calling it inappropriate.\n\n\"I did not kill my daughter, Harmony,\" Montgomery said when being sentenced for the firearms charges in August 2023. \"I could have had a meaningful life, but I blew that opportunity through drugs. But I loved my daughter unconditionally and I did not kill her.\"\n\nInstead, the defense aimed to pin the girl's death on Kayla Montgomery. Jurors were not convinced by that line of argument.\n\nMore Law&Crime coverage: 'She alone knows how Harmony died': Adam Montgomery defense pins long-missing girl's death on estranged wife during opening statement, admits helping cover-up\n\nPolice believe Harmony was killed on Dec. 7, 2019 -- the product of her father's rage after a series of \"bathroom accidents\" inside the Chrysler Sebring the Montgomery family begrudgingly called home. The family had been evicted the day before Thanksgiving that year.\n\nThen, for years, nothing. The lack of knowledge as to her whereabouts made its way onto law enforcement's radar after Sorey raised the alarm in December 2021. By then it was far too late.\n\nWhile the girl's remains have never been recovered, the state's lead witness, Kayla Montgomery, provided what is believed to be the most likely story of her death and disappearance.\n\nAdam Montgomery's rage toward his daughter culminated on Dec. 7, 2019, Kayla Montgomery told investigators. On that day, \"Adam struck Harmony in the face/head on three separate occasions because she had a bathroom accident,\" an affidavit filed in the case says.\n\n\"I think I really hurt her this time,\" Adam Montgomery allegedly said after the attack, his wife recalled. \"I think I did something.\"\n\nAfter the violence, Kayla Montgomery told investigators, the family returned to the parking lot of the apartment complex where they had consistently been parking their Sebring since being evicted. Later, she said, they realized the girl was dead and Adam Montgomery placed her body into a red and black Under Armour duffel bag.\n\nAccording to Kayla Montgomery, her husband kept Harmony Montgomery's body in the duffel bag and moved it around for several months. In the immediate aftermath of her death, Kayla Montgomery told investigators that her husband occasionally kept his daughter's body outside in the snow to slow down the process of decomposition.\n\nFor months, Kayla Montgomery told investigators, her husband moved the girl's remains around -- even keeping her in the walk-in freezer of a restaurant where he worked as a dishwasher and a cook. Eventually, the estranged wife said, Adam Montgomery used lime to try and dissolve some of his daughter's frozen body while \"squishing\" her flesh -- and how she helped cut away the child's clothes to make her body fit inside a tote bag bearing the logo of a Catholic hospital.\n\nThe girl's father, a career criminal, was ultimately convicted on one charge of murder in the second degree. He was also found guilty of related crimes including one count each of assault in the second degree, witness tampering, abuse of a corpse, and falsifying evidence.\n\nThe prosecution had offered a sentence of 35 years to life for the murder conviction, to allow other convictions to run concurrently -- or at the same time -- and still others to be suspended if only the killer had disclosed the location where the tote bag ended up.\n\nStaring on, unmoved by the offer, he did not.\n\nAdam Montgomery was sentenced to 45 years to life in prison for murder, three-and-a-half years to seven years apiece for falsifying evidence and tampering with witnesses, and four to eight years for assault in the second degree over an attack on Kayla Montgomery, as well a 12-month suspended sentence for abuse of a corpse. His total sentence is 56 years to life in prison.\n\nAnd this time, unlike so many times, he had to show up and be present.\n\n\"You took a human life and you did so in the most callous and heartless of ways,\" Judge Amy Messer told the defendant. \"You robbed a 5-year-old girl, your own daughter, of the life that she was to lead. You stole from your sons a sister. You took a daughter from her mother.\"", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

{"id": 237088674, "title": "Edo PDP asks Shaibu to resign over support for APC", "text": "The Edo State Peoples Democratic Party has lambasted ex-deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, for describing the party\u2019s governorship candidate, Asue Ighodalo, as an outsider. The PDP said it was contradictory for Shaibu to remain in the PDP and be demarketing the party\u2019s governorship candidate, urging him to rather resign his membership. Shaibu, a PDP member, declared on Sunday that he would be supporting the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Monday Okpebholo, in the September 21 governorship election in the state. He said while Okpebholo was a homeboy, who understood the challenges in the state, the PDP candidate, Ighodalo, was an outsider and a product of godfatherism. \u201cWe don\u2019t want an outsider. We have experimented with an outsider and it is not working, so this time, we want a homeboy. We have only two homeboys in the major political parties; one is in the Labour Party and one is in the All Progressives Congress. \u201cI chose to follow the homeboy in the APC. The man they are parading in the PDP is an outsider and we have also agreed that no more godfatherism in Edo. The man the PDP is parading is the godson of Obaseki and there is no way a godson can be governor of Edo State again,\u201d Shaibu had said. But reacting on Monday, the Deputy Director General of the media arm of the Edo PDP Governorship Campaign Council, Rev. Olu Martin, described Shaibu\u2019s reason for supporting the APC candidate as baseless. \u201cBecause the candidate didn\u2019t grow up in Edo, doesn\u2019t make him a stranger in his own state. \u201cI thought Shaibu would tell us that the candidate he wants to support has the capacity, intelligent, knack for excellence and smartnees, which are the hallmarks of a great leader,\u201d Martin said in a voice note sent to journalists on Monday. Martin added that it was contradictory for Shaibu to remain in the PDP and be working against the candidate of the party. \u201cThe honourable thing he should have done is to resign from the PDP like others and support the APC candidate. His argument is that of weak people,\u201d he said. Shaibu contested but lost the PDP governorship ticket to Ighodalo, who has the backing of Governor Godwin Obaseki.", "summary": "<p>The Edo State Peoples Democratic Party has lambasted ex-deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, for describing the party\u2019s governorship candidate, Asue Ighodalo, as an outsider.

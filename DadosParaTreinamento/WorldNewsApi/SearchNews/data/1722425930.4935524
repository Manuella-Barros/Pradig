{"id": 243243730, "title": "Dua Lipa review, Glastonbury 2024: More than mere pop spectacle", "text": "Dua Lipa saw it coming. The fireworks and flags and pulsing purple lights, the teenagers on tiptoes scowling at strange adults as they fling their arms in the air like money. When she was a girl, the 28-year-old born to Albania-Kosovan parents, tells us midway into her debut Glastonbury headline show, she wrote it down \u2013 \u201cI will headline Glastonbury\u201d \u2013 manifesting the sleeper hits and critical acclaim and now-routine awards and No 1s that made this moment inevitable. \u201cI was really specific,\u201d she adds after a shy laugh. \u201cI said I wanted to headline the Pyramid stage on a Friday night, because then I knew I could party for the next two days.\u201d Her voice cracks as she describes the magic \u2013 \u201cthe power\u201d \u2013 of commanding this seemingly infinite crowd. \u201cLittle me would just be beside herself right now.\u201d The growing Dua Lipa empire - now encompassing an acting career, a book club, a burgeoning media platform and a podcast featuring giants of high and low culture - shows no signs of slowing, particularly now she has bought back the rights to her music catalogue. Yet behind the cultural dominance, Dua Lipa is as enigmatic as she is ubiquitous. Her arrestingly vague persona (along, perhaps, with her admirable support for geopolitical causes) has stopped her transcending bankable fame to become a true nation\u2019s sweetheart. Which may be just how she likes it. More than a straight pop spectacle, Lipa intersperses tonight\u2019s set with nods to underground culture. As a martial drum solo opens the show, leather-clad dancers fling themselves across a pair of metal bridges, like a SWAT team sent undercover into Seventies New York\u2019s meatpacking district. In a chain-lined leather dress of her own, Lipa zips to center stage as if propelled by the roller-skates favoured on her last arena tour, barrelling into a party-starting \u201cTraining Season\u201d. Though the performance is tightly drilled \u2013 even the confetti deployment seems studied \u2013 passion rings through in moments of cheeky theatricality. Midway into the second verse, she flings back her head with revulsion at the inept exes she has made her muse. It is no contradiction that many such boyfriends are no doubt in this field screaming along: the gospel of Dua holds that, while guys often suck, that is often fine, and kind of funny. Her mastery is in pairing these tales of woe and self-redemption with music that sounds like accidentally having the best night of your life at the worst club in your hometown. Her celebration of alternative culture is most readily apparent on \u201cOne Kiss\u201d \u2013 given a house breakdown worthy of Glastonbury\u2019s wonderfully lurid queer nightlife haunt, NYC Downlow \u2013 and \u201cPretty Please\u201d, revitalised with deliciously dirty funk swing and a breakdancing interlude that squeezes homages to her house, disco and rave roots into two breathtaking minutes of helter-shelter beat switches. Between all this she finds time to introduce a comically low-key guest appearance: not one of her celeb buddies but an unassuming Kevin Parker \u2013 better known as the Australian psych-rock darling Tame Impala \u2013 who looks every bit the slacker boyfriend brought home to disappointed parents after their beloved daughter\u2019s gap year. In honour of his contributions to her latest album, Radical Optimism, Parker mooches out in a T-shirt and jeans for an endearingly clumsy duet of his song \u201cThe Less I Know the Better\u201d. Aside from the electrifying opener, new album cuts such as \u201cThese Walls\u201c and \u201cFalling Forever\u201d feel like stodgy, almost defensive inclusions \u2013 even closer \u201cHoudini\u201c can\u2019t help but feel anticlimactic after a sensational one-two of \u201cPhysical\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Start Now\u201d. I can believe, even hope, that Dua Lipa will endure to headline Glastonbury again, but it is harder to imagine these songs surviving as setlist musts. \u201cGuys, you\u2019re making my dreams come true,\u201d she declares during \u201cBe the One\u201d, a cliche that, despite the dips in momentum, makes clear that Lipa understood the assignment: Glastonbury is not just another show, just another festival \u2013 it is the moment we have been waiting for, all day, all year, perhaps all our lives. The best headline sets turn this into a reality, even among the sceptical. Dua Lipa does something almost as special: by bearing out her childhood premonition, she makes us witnesses to her own sweetest fantasy.", "summary": "<p>Though the performance is tightly drilled \u2013 even the confetti deployment seems studied \u2013 passion rings through in moments of cheeky theatricality</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/glastonbury/dua-lipa-review-glastonbury-2024-b2568403.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/28/23/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gMVMJDGc-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:30:50", "author": "Jazz Monroe", "authors": ["Jazz Monroe"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.276}

The Gloucestershire-based Connors family, who were imprisoned in 2012, tricked homeless men and people with addiction issues into living with them - with the promise of work, money and accommodation in exchange. William Connors, 64, his wife Mary, 60, their sons, John, 41, and James, 32 - as well as son-in-law Miles Connors, 35 - were convicted of conspiracy to require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour. Mark Ovenden, who was picked up by the family outside a food bank when he was homeless, recalled how the workers at the site were all living in a 'cramped horse box' in a candid ENDEVR Documentary, titled Inside the Modern British Slave Business on YouTube. Mark said: 'It would have been about eight living in a horse box which had kind of wooden bunks built into the side of it, kind of like the concentration camps, the long tunnel-like barracks and it looked exactly like that inside.' Enslaved labourer, Mark Ovenden, of jailed millionaire travellers the Connors revealed the terrifying conditions they faced- earning just \u00a35 a day and scavenging in bins for food Meanwhile the workers would have their heads shaved, their own clothes and belongings taken off them and be hosed down with cold water. 'When I was first picked up my house keys and my mobile phone disappeared,' Mark added. 'There was one outside tap for the workers to use cold water only, and this is approaching winter. Most of them hadn't showered or cleaned themselves for a couple of months at least.' Another one of the Connor family's former slaves, John, who hid his identity for fear of reprisal, revealed he was held by the Connors for 13 years in 'concentration camp'-like conditions. John explained: 'I went to somewhere which was almost like an open concentration camp where you were literally made to work and be punished on a regular basis, I couldn't see any means of getting away or escaping.' Police began investigating the family in 2008 after the remains of former worker Christopher Nichols were found near their caravan site. Christopher was a father of two from Bristol who disappeared in 2002, aged 37. He told his family that he had found a new job working as a handyman for a lady in Gloucester. John said: 'Billy [William] Connors' actions could be quite extreme. Chris, he'd been beaten with a metal toolbar which really hurt him badly, I heard the cries, we were all told to stay in our trailers.' Christopher worked as the Connors' main salesman but if he didn't get them any work he was subjected to violence. He did try to escape the Connors' clutches and ran out into the road one night - where he was hit by a car. William Connors, 64, was jailed in December 2012 for forcing vulnerable and homeless men to work as slave labourers at his caravan park in Staverton, Gloucestershire The men were living in filthy cramped conditions on the Connors caravan site, and their belongings were taken off them Police found the men in clothes that were covered in faeces, they had no teeth, shaved heads, some had scurvy and they had cat faeces on their bedsheets (pictured) Mark revealed the workers at the site were all living in a 'cramped horse box' (pictured) in a candid ENDEVR Documentary Inside the Modern British Slave Business on YouTube However Christopher's hospital stay was abruptly cut short when Billy Connors and his other slave John paid him a visit. 'Chris looked absolutely terrified, but when we seen him he looked very poorly,' John explained. 'He was very bruised, not well at all. 'The object of the visit was to get him from there and take him back to site where he would be put back to work. I couldn't believe that was really taking place. I was convinced that my boss was a psychopath, totally inhuman.' However when Christopher got back to the site, he was too unwell to work after the accident left him incontinent. Four months later, he disappeared. 'We were just told that he'd gone, that he'd moved on,' John said. 'One minute he was there the next minute he was gone.' After a neighbour found the remains of Christopher in a woods near the caravan site, police set up undercover surveillance of the Connors site. The surveillance revealed workers were living in cramped, filthy conditions and were often beaten, while the Connors lived the high life in plush accommodation and jetted off on luxury holidays. Detective Superintendent David Sellwood said: 'We saw workers leaving one or another of Billy's sites going on to work on driveways, they worked in all weathers, that winter was a particularly cold winter with snow on the ground, they'd clear the snow and they'd carry on block paving and digging. 'They worked from dawn till dusk, Billy and Breeda drove their workers around the clock 19 hours a day, six days a week, for as little as \u00a35 a day or no pay at all. The men were given so little to eat they were reduced to scavenging for food in dust bins.' In contrast, the Connors drove around in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van - and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds. Police began investigating the family in 2008 after the remains of a former worker Christopher Nichols (pictured) were found near their caravan site More than 8,000 hours of footage captured the men carrying out humiliating tasks including emptying buckets the family used as toilets, as well being subjected to brutal beatings (pictured) In December 2012, William was jailed for six \u2013and-a-half years. The victims - believed to be 37 in total - were paid as little as \u00a35 per day and those who received state hand-outs had the money confiscated by the family Williams wife Mary, also known as Brida -pictured - received a sentence of two years and three months Several houses - including one with a hot tub and accompanying flat screen television - were registered in the names of other relatives. The family bought two caravan parks in Gloucestershire for \u00a3545,000 more than a decade ago and had \u00a3576,000 in bank accounts seized by the police. The Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in Staverton, Gloucestershire, in Enderby Leicestershire and in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance operation. More than 8,000 hours of footage captured the men carrying out humiliating tasks including emptying buckets the family used as toilets, as well being subjected to brutal beatings. The victims - believed to be 37 in total - were paid as little as \u00a35 per day and those who received state hand-outs had the money confiscated by the family. When police raided the site they found out even more shocking details about the conditions and abuse the workers were subjected to. The enslaved workers revealed they were told if they tried to escape they would be tracked down and killed. Mark explained: 'I was definitely kept a prisoner. There weren't any locked gates or bars or anything like that but I was it was made very, very clear that if I was to go out, if I was to try to leave - then the consequences would be pretty grave. 'Escape was not an option, you know that wherever you go you're going to be found, I'm some 120- 130 miles from home, I didn't have any money in my pocket, I didn't have any reason to suspect that the authorities would take me seriously if I went to them. The Connors went on lavish holidays, drove around in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford Ranger and a Mercedes van - and had built up a mounting property portfolio potentially worth millions of pounds Detective Superintendent David Sellwood said they saw the slaves working in freezing weather and scavenging in bins for food 'So where was I going to go? Leave here and have to walk any number of miles in any direction, I'm going to be fairly easy to pick up again.' However against the odds, in July 2011 two workers went to the police while canvassing for work. In police interview footage one of the men, who remains anonymous, said: 'I went out canvassing all day and I didn't get one customer. He punched me in the eye as hard as he could, he put me in the boot of the car, it was dark. They said if you try leave we are going to f***ing murder you.' In September 2011, 200 police officers descended on the Connors' site at Green Acres and they uncovered the true horror of the operation. They found the men in clothes that were covered in faeces, who had no teeth, with shaved heads. Some had scurvy and others had cat faeces on their bedsheets. The family initially denied any wrongdoing but were each convicted, by a unanimous jury, of conspiracy to require a person to carry out forced or compulsory labour. Between them they were given 18 years behind bars, though the five family members have now all been released. In December 2012, William was jailed for six \u2013and-a-half years while his wife Mary, also known as Brida, received a sentence of two years and three months. John was jailed for four years and James got three years' detention in a young offender institution. Son-in-law Miles received a three-year prison sentence. Christopher Quinlan, prosecuting, said that the family gained in the region of \u00a35 million from their crimes. Detective Inspector David Sellwood said at the time that it was a relief to have the case wrapped up after four years and ten months of hard work. Speaking outside court, he said: 'There were times when we thought we might get nothing so today's result is phenomenal. 'Getting a conviction was one thing but making them pay back was another. 'Now, 18 months after we started looking into the money situation, they have been ordered to pay back \u00a32.25 million. 'They have already signed over around half a million pounds in bank accounts, so that is money that can be recovered quite quickly. 'This is not going to be something that stops. They owe \u00a35 million, so if we see them driving around in flashy cars or purchasing luxury homes we will go after them. 'I am really happy with the amount they have been ordered to pay back today though - it sends out a message to criminals that we will get proceeds of crime back. 'This really will have a damning effect on the Connors family.'

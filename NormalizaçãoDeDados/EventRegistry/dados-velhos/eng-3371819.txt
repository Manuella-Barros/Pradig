For the first time, such a conflict involves a third country -- the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nAnd the potential for dangerous clashes elsewhere on the rugged mountainous border remains real, analysts say. Indian and Chinese patrols jostled each other and exchanged blows Tuesday morning by a lake in the Ladakh region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to local reports.\n\n\"It would be very complacent to rule out escalation,\" said Shashank Joshi, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London. \"It's the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\"\n\nThe standoff also reflects an expanding geopolitical contest between Asia's most populous nations. As China fortifies islands in the South China Sea and exerts its influence through ambitious infrastructure projects throughout the continent, its dominance of Asian affairs is growing, as is its unwillingness to brook rivals. India is seen by some as the last counterbalance.\n\n\"The most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China, and there is no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow India's strategic space by penetrating India's own neighborhood. This is what we see happening,\" former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said recently at an event in New Delhi.\n\nThe incident began in mid-June, when a crew from the People's Liberation Army, the PLA, entered a remote plateau -- populated largely by Bhutanese shepherds -- with earth-moving and other equipment and \"attempted to build a road,\" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThey were confronted by a Royal Bhutan Army patrol; Indian soldiers pitched tents there two days later. India and Bhutan -- a country of just under 800,000 -- have long had a special relationship that includes military support and $578 million in aid to Bhutan.\n\nIndia says the road would have moved Chinese troops closer to India's strategically important Siliguri Corridor, known as the Chicken's Neck, the narrow stretch of land that separates India's northeast from the rest of the country.\n\nChina asserted that more than 270 Indian border troops, carrying weapons and driving two bulldozers, \"flagrantly crossed the boundary\" and advanced about 100 yards into Chinese territory.\n\nThe roots of the distrust between the two nations go back to India's decision to shelter the Dalai Lama in 1959, when the spiritual leader fled Tibet during an uprising there, and to China's invasion during a brief border war in 1962.\n\nThere was a marked deterioration in relations after India signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2005 and ties deepened between the two large democracies.\n\nIn 2014, Narendra Modi came into office as the most pro-China Indian prime minister since 1962, wanting not only to emulate China's economic progress, but also to attract Chinese investment, analysts say.\n\nBut he found Chinese President Xi Jinping to be an unreliable partner, as China blocked India's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group and blocked efforts at the United Nations to declare Pakistani militant Masood Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations.\n\nWhen China's sweeping Belt and Road development initiative added an economic corridor through parts of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, a region that India claims, the tensions rose sharply. Modi snubbed a major summit in Beijing that launched the Belt and Road plan this year.\n\nMeanwhile, India alarmed China by allowing the Dalai Lama this year to visit an important Buddhist monastery in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, a region Beijing claims is part of Tibet.\n\n\"India has tolerated and supported Tibetan separatists, allowing the Tibetan independence groups to set up an 'exile government' in India,\" said Long Xingchun, director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University in Nanchong.\n\nTwo months in, a few hundred Chinese and Indian troops remain hunkered down on the plateau -- and the threat of violence looms.\n\nXu Guangyu, a retired PLA major general, said China has been preparing to evict Indian troops if New Delhi does not back down but hoped that China's objective could be realized without bloodshed.\n\n\"We won't be the first to fire. We are very clear about this line, and this shows China's sincerity,\" he said. \"But it's not up to China to decide. Whether there is to be war depends on the Indians. However, if they fire the first shot, they would lose control and the initiative.\"\n\nIn recent days, Chinese media has kept up its overheated rhetoric, culminating in the release by a state-run news agency of a bizarre video mocking India as a bad neighbor -- with an actor wearing a turban, fake beard speaking in a put-on Indian accent. Indian netizens immediately denounced the video as racist. Perhaps more troubling, the Global Times reported that the government was setting up blood collection centers and moving its blood supplies closer to the area in Tibet.\n\nIndia has undertaken a variety of preparedness measures with its eye on Chinese escalation, Joshi said, including advancing the operational alert status of several units by two months, which involves moving two of its mountain divisions toward the region and allowing troops to begin acclimatizing to higher altitudes.\n\n\"Clearly, there are a whole set of measures they've taken as discreetly as possible to shield themselves from snap Chinese offenses,\" Joshi said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri":

For the first time, such a conflict involves a third country - the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nAnd the potential for dangerous clashes elsewhere on the rugged mountainous border remains real, analysts say. Indian and Chinese patrols jostled each other and exchanged blows Tuesday morning by a lake in the Ladakh region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to local reports.\n\n\"It would be very complacent to rule out escalation,\" said Shashank Joshi, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London. \"It's the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\"\n\nThe standoff also reflects an expanding geopolitical contest between Asia's most populous nations. As China fortifies islands in the South China Sea and exerts its influence through ambitious infrastructure projects throughout the continent, its dominance of Asian affairs is growing, as is its unwillingness to brook rivals. India is seen by some as the last counterbalance.\n\n\"The most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China, and there is no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow India's strategic space by penetrating India's own neighborhood. This is what we see happening,\" former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said recently at an event in New Delhi.\n\nThe incident began in mid-June, when a crew from the People's Liberation Army, the PLA, entered a remote plateau - populated largely by Bhutanese shepherds - with earth-moving and other equipment and \"attempted to build a road,\" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThey were confronted by a Royal Bhutan Army patrol; Indian soldiers pitched tents there two days later. India and Bhutan - a country of just under 800,000 - have long had a special relationship that includes military support and $578 million in aid to Bhutan.\n\nIndia says the road would have moved Chinese troops closer to India's strategically important Siliguri Corridor, known as the Chicken's Neck, the narrow stretch of land that separates India's northeast from the rest of the country.\n\nChina asserted that more than 270 Indian border troops, carrying weapons and driving two bulldozers, \"flagrantly crossed the boundary\" and advanced about 100 yards into Chinese territory.\n\nThe roots of the distrust between the two nations go back to India's decision to shelter the Dalai Lama in 1959, when the spiritual leader fled Tibet during an uprising there, and to China's invasion during a brief border war in 1962.\n\nThere was a marked deterioration in relations after India signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2005 and ties deepened between the two large democracies.\n\nIn 2014, Narendra Modi came into office as the most pro-China Indian prime minister since 1962, wanting not only to emulate China's economic progress, but also to attract Chinese investment, analysts say.\n\nBut he found Chinese President Xi Jinping to be an unreliable partner, as China blocked India's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group and blocked efforts to declare Pakistani militant Masood Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations.\n\nWhen China's sweeping Belt and Road development initiative added an economic corridor through parts of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, a region that India claims, the tensions rose sharply. Modi snubbed a major summit in Beijing that launched the Belt and Road plan this year.\n\nMeanwhile, India alarmed China by allowing the Dalai Lama to visit an important Buddhist monastery in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh this year, a region Beijing claims is part of Tibet.\n\n\"India has tolerated and supported Tibetan separatists, allowing the Tibetan independence groups to set up an 'exile government' in India,\" said Long Xingchun, director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University in Nanchong.\n\nTwo months in, a few hundred Chinese and Indian troops remain hunkered down on the plateau - and the threat of violence remains real.\n\nXu Guangyu, a retired PLA major general, said China has been preparing to evict Indian troops if New Delhi does not back down but hoped that China's objective could be realized without bloodshed.\n\n\"We won't be the first to fire. We are very clear about this line, and this shows China's sincerity,\" he said. \"But it's not up to China to decide. Whether there is to be war depends on the Indians. However, if they fire the first shot, they would lose control and the initiative.\"\n\nIndia has undertaken a variety of preparedness measures with its eye on Chinese escalation, Joshi said, including advancing the operational alert status of several units by two months, which involves moving two of its mountain divisions toward the region and allowing troops to begin acclimatizing to higher altitudes.\n\n\"Clearly, there are a whole set of measures they've taken as discreetly as possible to shield themselves from snap Chinese offenses,\" Joshi said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories":

Indian and Chinese patrols jostled each other and exchanged blows on Tuesday morning (Aug 15) by a lake in the Ladakh region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to local reports.\n\n\"It would be very complacent to rule out escalation,\" said analyst Shashank Joshi from the Royal United Services Institute in London. \"It's the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\"\n\nThe standoff also reflects an expanding geopolitical contest between Asia's most populous nations. As China fortifies islands in the South China Sea and exerts its influence through ambitious infrastructure projects throughout the continent, its dominance of Asian affairs is growing, as is its unwillingness to brook rivals.\n\nIndia is seen by some as the last counterbalance.\n\n\"The most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China, and there is no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow India's strategic space by penetrating India's own neighbourhood. This is what we see happening,\" former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said recently at an event in New Delhi.\n\nThe incident began in mid-June when a crew from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered a remote plateau - populated largely by Bhutanese shepherds - with earth-moving and other equipment, and \"attempted to build a road,\" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThey were confronted by a Royal Bhutan Army patrol; Indian soldiers pitched tents there two days later.\n\nIndia and Bhutan - a country of just under 800,000 - have long had a special relationship that includes military support and US$578 million (S$790 million) in aid to Bhutan.\n\nIndia says the road would have moved Chinese troops closer to India's strategically important Siliguri Corridor, known as the Chicken's Neck, the narrow stretch of land that separates India's north-east from the rest of the country.\n\nChina asserted that more than 270 Indian border troops, carrying weapons and driving two bulldozers, \"flagrantly crossed the boundary\" and advanced more than 90m into Chinese territory.\n\nThe roots of the distrust between the two nations go back to India's decision to shelter the Dalai Lama in 1959, when the spiritual leader fled Tibet during an uprising there, and to China's invasion during a brief border war in 1962.\n\nThere was a marked deterioration in relations after India signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2005 and ties deepened between the two large democracies.\n\nIn 2014, Narendra Modi came into office as the most pro-China Indian prime minister since 1962, wanting not only to emulate China's economic progress, but also to attract Chinese investment, analysts say.\n\nBut he found Chinese President Xi Jinping to be an unreliable partner, as China blocked India's application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group and blocked efforts at the United Nations to declare Pakistani militant Masood Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations.\n\nWhen China's sweeping Belt and Road development initiative added an economic corridor through parts of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, a region that India claims, the tensions rose sharply. Modi snubbed a major summit in Beijing that launched the Belt and Road plan this year.\n\nMeanwhile, India alarmed China by allowing the Dalai Lama this year to visit an important Buddhist monastery in India's north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, a region Beijing claims is part of Tibet.\n\n\"India has tolerated and supported Tibetan separatists, allowing the Tibetan independence groups to set up an 'exile government' in India,\" said Long Xingchun, director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University in Nanchong.\n\nTwo months in, a few hundred Chinese and Indian troops remain hunkered down on the plateau - and the threat of violence looms.\n\nXu Guangyu, a retired PLA major general, said China has been preparing to evict Indian troops if New Delhi does not back down but hoped that China's objective could be realised without bloodshed.\n\n\"We won't be the first to fire. We are very clear about this line, and this shows China's sincerity,\" he said. \"But it's not up to China to decide. Whether there is to be war depends on the Indians. However, if they fire the first shot, they would lose control and the initiative.\"\n\nIn recent days, Chinese media has kept up its overheated rhetoric, culminating in the release by a state-run news agency of a bizarre video mocking India as a bad neighbour - with an actor wearing a turban, fake beard speaking in a put-on Indian accent.\n\nIndian netizens immediately denounced the video as racist. Perhaps more troubling, the Global Times reported that the government was setting up blood collection centres and moving its blood supplies closer to the area in Tibet.\n\nIndia has undertaken a variety of preparedness measures with its eye on Chinese escalation, said Joshi, the analyst from the Royal United Services Institute. These include advancing the operational alert status of several units by two months, which involves moving two of its mountain divisions toward the region and allowing troops to begin acclimatising to higher altitudes.\n\n\"Clearly, there are a whole set of measures they've taken as discreetly as possible to shield themselves from snap Chinese offenses,\" he said.", "date": "2017-08-18",

We will continue to engage with China to find mutually acceptable solution. Peace and tranquillity in border areas are important pre-requisites for smooth development of bilateral relations.\" However, he quipped, \"I am not an astrologer, so cannot predict\", when asked by when the Dokalam standoff will be resolved.\n\nAsked if China has shared hydrological data with India in the backdrop of floods in Assam, Kumar said there is an existing expert-level mechanism, established in 2006, and there are two MoUs under which China is expected to share hydrological data on rivers Satluj and Brahmaputra with India during the flood season of May 15 to June 15.\n\n\"For this year, we have not received hydrological data from the Chinese side,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, he added that it was \"premature\" to link it with the floods in Assam.\n\nHe also noted that in view of floods in Bihar, India was closely coordinating with Nepal, both at Centre and state- level.\n\nAsked about the reported comments of the Japanese Ambassador on Dokalam face off and if India welcomes it, Kumar gave a very guarded reaction, saying the remarks speak for themselves.\n\nThe Japanese ambassador was quoted in media as saying that no country should use unilateral forces to alter the status of Dokalam.\n\n\"We recognise Dokalam is a disputed area between Bhutan and China and two countries are engaged in border talks...

It's the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\"\n\nFurther, former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said recently at an event in New Delhi, \"The most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China, and there is no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow India's strategic space by penetrating India's own neighborhood. This is what we see happening.\"\n\nTies between the neighbors have already soured over China's military assistance to India's arch rival Pakistan and its expanding presence in smaller nations in South Asia which India long regarded as its area of influence.\n\nChina has, in turn, criticized the Modi government's public embrace of the Dalai Lama and its decision to let the Tibetan spiritual leader, whom it calls a \"dangerous splittist,\" to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh which China claims as its own.\n\nLast week, India's defence minister Arun Jaitley told the parliament that the country's armed forces are \"prepared to take on any eventuality\" of the stand-off.\n\nEarlier in the conflict, China caused more anxiety in India after it retaliated by closing a mountain pass that Indian pilgrims use to reach Mount Kailash, a sacred Hindu and Buddhist site in Tibet.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id":

For the last several weeks, China has been warning of helping insurgents in India, invading border areas in Uttaranchal and Kashmir, and a war breaking out soon. It is clear China cannot afford a war over Doklam. That's why India has not responded to China's belligerence in equal measure.\n\nHowever, there is one war which can break out and India cannot afford it -- a trade war with China. Recently, India imposed anti-dumping duties on 93 Chinese products. China is not going to tolerate this measure and is likely to respond. State-owned Chinese media has urged Chinese firms to reconsider the risks of investing in India and warned New Delhi to be prepared for the \"possible consequences for its ill-considered action\".\n\nAn article in state-owned Global Times said that China could easily retaliate with restrictions on Indian products, but added that it \"doesn't make much economic sense\" for the country. But it warned that a trade war between China and India seemed to be looming after the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Chinese products.\n\nWhy India cannot afford to fight a trade war with China at this juncture? Consider the following:\n\nIndia's trade deficit with China rose to $46.56 billion last year. China's exports to India totaled $58.33 billion, registering a meager increase of 0.2% compared to $58.25 billion in 2015. India's exports to China dropped 12% from 2015 to $11.76 billion.\n\nIndia exports less to China (mainly raw materials) and imports more (mainly electronics and other manufactured goods which are in high demand). India's pharma sector has critical dependence on Chinese imports used in drugs manufacturing.\n\nChina's exports to India account for only 2 per cent of its total exports. So even if Indians boycott all the goods imported form China, it will not make as big an impact on China as to bring it to its knees before India.\n\nOf course, China needs new markets for its manufactured goods, and India is one of those new markets where its electronic goods, especially smartphones, have found a large market. But China can find markets in other Asian countries and even in Africa. It is also trying to create a market for its good in Europe. It is in no way dependent on India.\n\nChina is India's largest trading partner, but the trade is heavily skewed in favour of China. A trade war when Indian manufacturing ability is limited is not going to favour India. India's imports from China are crucial at this stage.\n\nIndia today imports telecom gear worth over Rs 70,000 crore annually, much of it from Chinese firms like Huawei and ZTE. Chinese companies dominate the telecom sector in India. In handsets, they control 51% of India's $8 billion plus smartphone market with brands like Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus.\n\nPower is another sector where India has come to be dependent on Chinese imports. In the 12th Plan alone, almost 30% of the generating capacity was imported from China. In the rapidly growing solar energy sector, between April 2016 and January 2017, solar equipment from China had a share of 87% in a market pegged at $1.9 billion. According to consultancy firm Grant Thornton, in 2017, when inbound deals dipped, the Chinese shifted gears and accounted for 31% of the inbound deal value as against 27% from the US.\n\nThe popular impression is that China is dumping consumer goods into India. But the fact is that India depends on China for capital goods too. Reduction in import of cheaper capital goods will push up production costs.\n\nIndia can fight trade wars with China only when it has removed the big skew in its trade with China, which can take a decade of manufacturing growth.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 269, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "wgt": 100, "id": 828, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302682", "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "305286", "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314119", "label": {"eng": "Xiaomi Tech"}}]}

The home ministry has also spelt out locations where foreign investment is not welcome such as those close to the border and vital installations.\n\nAccording to the data provided by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, China invested USD 1.64 billion (Rs 10,094 crore) from April 2000 to March 2017. Chinese companies have invested mostly in telecom, power, engineering and infrastructure sectors. Several Chinese companies have also shown an interest in setting up industrial parks in India.\n\nThe standoff between troops of India and China at Dokalam area started after Bhutan, which has close diplomatic and military ties with India, protested to Beijing about People's Liberation Army troops building a road in the strategic location close to the chicken neck tri-junction. Doka La is the Indian name for the region which Bhutan recognises as Dokalam, while China claims it as part of its Donglang region.\n\nReports said there was tension between the Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir and in Barahuti in Uttarakhand in the recent past. India and China share a 3,488-km-long border from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: China Doklam Standoff", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 149, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian", "wgt": 100, "id": 299, "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Asian"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "wgt": 100, "id": 642, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lad\u0101kh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladakh", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lad\u0101kh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53390"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65436"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302736", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303871", "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305325", "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319077", "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian Army"}, "type": "loc", "id": "326389"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013Pakistan_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "358045", "label": {"eng": "China\u2013Pakistan relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "384931", "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangong_Tso", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pangong Tso"}, "type": "loc", "id": "452097"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Actual_Control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "621522", "label": {"eng": "Line of Actual Control"}}]}

It all stems from an event that took place in the middle of June when a construction crew with the China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) entered the isolated Doklam plateau.\n\nAccording to India's Ministry of External Affairs, the Chinese entered the area with earth-moving construction vehicles and other equipment. They then \"attempted to build a road\" in the secluded region that is mostly populated by Bhutanese shepherds and is claimed as part of the small Asian Kingdom. However, the PLA crew were confronted by a patrol from the Royal Bhutan Army. Two days later, Indian soldiers showed up to the area and set up shop. Since then hundreds of India soldiers have been in a standoff with the Chinese.\n\nIndia and Bhutan have long been allies, with India providing them with military support. According to an analysis that IndiaSpend did on data from the country's foreign ministry, Bhutan has been the largest recipient of Indian foreign aid in terms of amount and share for the past 17 years. India also values the small country of only about 800,000 people due to their growing hydroelectric power potential and key strategic location.\n\nSince the standoff started the two sides have given different accounts, as mistrust between China and India deepens to the lowest it has been in decades. India argued that the road would have put China's troops to close to the Siliguri Corridor, the thin stretch of land separating the northeastern part of India from the rest of the country. Meanwhile, China has contended that over two hundred Indian troops with weapons and two bulldozers advanced 300 feet (100 yards) into Chinese territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, the conflict escalated as a source in New Dehli with knowledge of the military situation on the border said the two sides had gotten into a skirmish. Apparently, a group of Chinese troops carrying iron rods and stones crossed into the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir. Both sides suffered minor injuries in the altercation between their troops.\n\nSushma Swaraj, India's foreign minister, has said that the dispute can only end with dialogue between both sides. However, China has been adamant in defending its right to construct a road in the Doklam area, which is land that the Chinese government claims is theirs. A lot of the 2,200-mile (3,540 kilometers) long border between China and India is still in dispute. However, this is the first time that Bhutan has been wrapped up in any of the border disputes between the two Asian giants.\n\nInternational analysts are more worried about this recent border spat since China is setting it up as a direct assault on its territorial integrity. Shashank Joshi, an analyst with the Royal Services Institute in London, started that \"It would be complacent to rule out escalation.\" This comes as China has been beefing up its influence and flexing its military muscles in Asia, with many seeing India as the one country that can counter them.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "120"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lad\u0101kh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladakh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lad\u0101kh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53390"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54026"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306627", "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319077", "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushma_Swaraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342477", "label": {"eng": "Sushma Swaraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siliguri_Corridor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "416617", "label": {"eng": "Siliguri Corridor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bhutan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "448717", "label": {"eng": "Royal Bhutan Army"}}]}

Beijing is intensifying its warnings to Indian troops to get out of a contested region high in the Himalayas where China, India and Bhutan meet, saying China has been restrained but \"restraint has its limits.\"Ng Han Guan/AP photoShareAdjustCommentPrint\n\nBy Annie Gowen and Simon Denyer\n\nNEW DELHI \u00e2\u0080\" As nuclear posturing between North Korea and the United States rivets the world, a quieter conflict between India and China is playing out on a remote Himalayan ridge \u00e2\u0080\" with stakes just as high.\n\nFor the past two months, Indian and Chinese troops have faced off on a plateau in the Himalayas in tense proximity, in a dispute prompted by moves by the Chinese military to build a road into territory claimed by India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close ally, Bhutan.\n\nIndia has suggested that both sides withdraw, and its foreign minister said in Parliament that the dispute can be resolved only by dialogue.\n\nYet China has vociferously defended the right it claims to build a road in the Doklam area, land it also claims.\n\nSince the dispute began, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has issued an angry stream of almost daily denunciations of India and its \u00e2\u0080\u009cillegal trespass\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crecklessness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d along with demands that New Delhi withdraw its troops \u00e2\u0080\u009cif it cherishes peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIncursions and scuffles between the two countries have long occurred along India and China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3,500-kilometre border \u00e2\u0080\" much of which remains in dispute \u00e2\u0080\" although the respective militaries have not fired shots at each other in a half-century.\n\nAnalysts say that this most recent dispute is more worrisome because it comes at a time when relations between the two nuclear-armed powers are declining, with China framing the issue as a direct threat to its territorial integrity. For the first time, such a conflict involves a third country \u00e2\u0080\" the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nAnd the potential for dangerous clashes elsewhere on the rugged mountainous border remains real, analysts say. Indian and Chinese patrols jostled each other and exchanged blows Tuesday morning by a lake in the Ladakh region of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to local reports.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be very complacent to rule out escalation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Shashank Joshi, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe standoff also reflects an expanding geopolitical contest between Asia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most populous nations. As China fortifies islands in the South China Sea and exerts its influence through ambitious infrastructure projects throughout the continent, its dominance of Asian affairs is growing, as is its unwillingness to brook rivals. India is seen by some as the last counterbalance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe most significant challenge to India comes from the rise of China, and there is no doubt in my mind that China will seek to narrow India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategic space by penetrating India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own neighbourhood. This is what we see happening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran said recently at an event in New Delhi.\n\nThe incident began in mid-June, when a crew from the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army, the PLA, entered a remote plateau \u00e2\u0080\" populated largely by Bhutanese shepherds \u00e2\u0080\" with earth-moving and other equipment and \u00e2\u0080\u009cattempted to build a road,\u00e2\u0080\u009d India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.\n\nThey were confronted by a Royal Bhutan Army patrol; Indian soldiers pitched tents there two days later. India and Bhutan \u00e2\u0080\" a country of just under 800,000 \u00e2\u0080\" have long had a special relationship that includes military support and $578 million in aid to Bhutan.\n\nIndia says the road would have moved Chinese troops closer to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strategically important Siliguri Corridor, known as the Chicken\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Neck, the narrow stretch of land that separates India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northeast from the rest of the country.\n\nChina asserted that more than 270 Indian border troops, carrying weapons and driving two bulldozers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cflagrantly crossed the boundary\u00e2\u0080\u009d and advanced about 100 yards into Chinese territory.\n\nThe roots of the distrust between the two nations go back to India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to shelter the Dalai Lama in 1959, when the spiritual leader fled Tibet during an uprising there, and to China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invasion during a brief border war in 1962.\n\nThere was a marked deterioration in relations after India signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United States in 2005 and ties deepened between the two large democracies.\n\nIn 2014, Narendra Modi came into office as the most pro-China Indian prime minister since 1962, wanting not only to emulate China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic progress, but also to attract Chinese investment, analysts say.\n\nBut he found Chinese President Xi Jinping to be an unreliable partner, as China blocked India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group and blocked efforts to declare Pakistani militant Masood Azhar a terrorist at the United Nations.\n\nWhen China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweeping Belt and Road development initiative added an economic corridor through parts of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, a region that India claims, the tensions rose sharply. Modi snubbed a major summit in Beijing that launched the Belt and Road plan this year.\n\nMeanwhile, India alarmed China by allowing the Dalai Lama to visit an important Buddhist monastery in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh this year, a region Beijing claims is part of Tibet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndia has tolerated and supported Tibetan separatists, allowing the Tibetan independence groups to set up an \u00e2\u0080\u0098exile government\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in India,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Long Xingchun, director of the Center for Indian Studies at China West Normal University in Nanchong.\n\nTwo months in, a few hundred Chinese and Indian troops remain hunkered down on the plateau \u00e2\u0080\" and the threat of violence remains real.\n\nXu Guangyu, a retired PLA major general, said China has been preparing to evict Indian troops if New Delhi does not back down but hoped that China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s objective could be realized without bloodshed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the first to fire. We are very clear about this line, and this shows China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sincerity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not up to China to decide. Whether there is to be war depends on the Indians. However, if they fire the first shot, they would lose control and the initiative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIndia has undertaken a variety of preparedness measures with its eye on Chinese escalation, Joshi said, including advancing the operational alert status of several units by two months, which involves moving two of its mountain divisions toward the region and allowing troops to begin acclimatizing to higher altitudes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cClearly, there are a whole set of measures they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken as discreetly as possible to shield themselves from snap Chinese offenses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joshi said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social

The rhetoric emanating from Beijing continues to be belligerent and hostile.\n\nA Chinese commentator was quoted saying: \"China could carry out small scale military action if India didn't immediately and unconditionally withdraw its troops.\"\n\nBut in terms of economic relations between the two trading partners, who really has the edge? And what effect could this conflict have on the trade front?\n\nBilateral trade between India and China is around $71.5 billion, but it is not an entirely level playing field.\n\nIndia's imports from China stand at around $61bn and India's exports to China is around $10bn, so the trade deficit is palpable.\n\nAlso, China is becoming a significant investor on key areas of India's start-ups. A crucial part of this sector of India is getting Chinese money, funding, and investment.\n\nNeedless to say, the Chinese have a considerable influence on the Indian economy already.\n\nFor example, more than 50% market share of all handsets today in India are Chinese, and the figures are growing.\n\nIndia's concerns\n\nIn the last three years alone, China's trade surplus with India has doubled. The Chinese are flooding the Indian market, and China has emerged as an important creditor, creating a Mumbai lobby that's beholden into China.\n\nSo now, India has three major concerns strategically. The first is that New Delhi is underwriting China's India containment strategy, for example, the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) that China is building through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) -- it's total value is less than the annual trade surplus that China enjoys with India (and that's just one year's trade surplus).\n\nOne thing China is developing expertise in is cyber-warfare, which can cripple India's economy\n\nSo, whatever China is doing in terms of containing India -- India is actually indirectly funding that by allowing China to reap these burgeoning trade surpluses, an estimate of around $60bn annually.\n\nA second concern is the domination by China of India's telecommunication and power sector, while the third is the fact that China is leveraging its credit to certain important Indian companies, and it has created a lobby within India that's putting pressure on the Indian government not to do anything on the trade front.\n\nOn an even more serious note, one thing China is developing expertise in is cyber-warfare, which can cripple India's economy.\n\nWhat can India do?\n\nThree sectors are crucial: Communication, transportation, and energy.\n\nI don't think India seems to realise that in the event of a serious showdown with China, they can cripple India's transportation, energy, and communication. In order to prevent that from becoming a reality, giving incentives to Taiwan, South Korea, the Japanese and others to make India a more attractive destination can be more beneficial than it seems.\n\nIndia doesn't manufacture semi-conductors, it doesn't manufacture the basics of insulators or handsets.\n\nThese particular sectors should consult and negotiate with private sectors, especially where there may be certain disincentives for the Chinese.\n\nHow to reduce Chinese dominance in strategic areas like telecom?\n\nIndia can't separate the economic elements from the geo-strategic elements. Geo-strategy includes economics as an essential component. In fact, India has to have a holistic, integrated approach in which it blends military, diplomatic, and economic elements into a coherent strategy vis-\u00e0-vis China.\n\nWhen China is waging economic warfare against India, its goal is to establish a robust manufacturing base in India.\n\nBy dumping goods in the Indian market, China ensures that Indian manufacturing sector doesn't grow. It deprives the Indian government of billions of dollars in customs, levies, and tax revenue.\n\nIt's a two-pronged economic warfare that is being waged and India can only address that if it's part of its geo-strategic plan.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Jammu and Kashm\u012br"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54026"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54715"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55019"}]}

The standoff began when India objected to China's construction of a road there, leading both sides to deploy troops in sizeable numbers.\n\nNew Delhi has confirmed that more than 50 Indian soldiers are presently facing not less than 800 Chinese troops in the plateau, which China considers as its territory.\n\nMany observers say that an armed conflict between the two Asian powers cannot be ruled out.\n\nLast month, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a warning to New Delhi to withdraw the Indian troops Dokalam or \"risk escalation.\" Nothing sums up the attitude of the hawks in Beijing better than an article that appeared on the state-owned Chinese tabloid, the Global Times. John Gong, a professor at Beijing's University of International Business wrote, \"To such an unruly neighbour (India), China should reciprocate in a language that it can understand. The famous or infamous Indian bravado is never backed up by substance in its history with China. If memory is short on the Indian side, perhaps there should be a second lesson.\" The western media is also rife with reports about an impending war between the two Asian giants. Online media outlets like the UK's Business Insider and the Independent have come out with reports saying that both countries are on the verge of a full-blown war.\n\nSo, how close are we to a war with China?\n\nThe Dokalam crisis has a rare precedent in the history of India-China disputes. Border standoffs between India and China are nothing new. However, hardly any have dragged on for two months without an end in sight. Most were resolved in a span of fewer than four weeks, thanks to diplomacy. However, this time around, China has clearly stated its lack of willingness to engage in any sort of negotiations with New Delhi prior to a complete withdrawal of Indian troops from Dokalam.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, has called for a simultaneous withdrawal of troops, which China has flatly refused, claiming that the plateau is Chinese territory.\n\nSo is war likely?\n\nNo one can predict with certainty that a war is in the offing. However, if the current standoff is to end, both sides will have to make compromises. And to do that without losing face is nearly impossible for both sides.\n\nFrom Beijing's vantage point, India is sticking its neck into a dispute between China and Bhutan.\n\nAn op-ed on the Global Times claimed that India is using Bhutan to further its regional hegemonistic designs. Quoting a Chinese academic, the daily noted that India has time and again interfered in Bhutan's diplomatic affairs to further its own regional hegemonistic designs.\n\nFor a rising power with pronounced regional aspirations like China, there is no greater snub than this.\n\n\"No matter what vassalage relationship India maintains with Bhutan, it baffles one that India has the courage to transgress the Chinese border on Bhutan's behalf. Well, if this kind of logic holds, China can certainly enter into Kashmir, including India-controlled Kashmir, upon Pakistan's invitation,\" John Gong observed in his Global Times piece.\n\nBacking down means sending a wrong message\n\nThe Chinese leadership is aware that if it holds down its guns now, it would be sending a wrong message to its Southeast Asian neighbours many of whom have long-running territorial disputes with China. Countries like Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines will take home the lesson that China is a paper dragon and that the Chinese threats are nothing more than empty rhetoric.\n\nMoreover, Indian soldiers have set up tents and are camping on a piece of land that China considers as its own. How can China agree to negotiations when Indian soldiers are on supposed Chinese territory?\n\nThings look more or less the same from New Delhi. Capitulating to Beijing's demand that it pull out all its troops before any negotiations can take place would mean a loss of pride. Moreover, now that the crisis has dragged on for long, conceding to the Chinese demands without a credible assurance that Beijing would halt the construction of the road leading to Chambi Valley is tantamount to New Delhi forsaking its core national security interests. This would convey to China that India would back down when confronted with the threat of force, which would give Beijing an upper hand in future negotiations between the two countries.\n\nMoreover, now that India has put up a bold face against China, withdrawing without appropriate compensation would be a debilitating blow to the morale of not just its soldiers but also the entire nation.\n\nPreparing for an unlikely war?\n\nNone of this is to say that a full-scale war is likely. The two are nuclear powers and it is still reasonable to put faith in the assumption that two nuclear powers would not go to war with each other.\n\nMoreover, although they whip up nationalistic euphoria, those at the helm of affairs in both Beijing and New Delhi have linked their survival to the economic growth and prosperity of their respective countries.\n\nAs such, a full blown war could be nothing other than an instrument of last resort.\n\nBut how about a limited war?\n\nBoth countries are aware that if fighting erupts, there is always a possibility that things may spiral out of control. As the Italian philosopher, Niccolo Machiavelli said, \"Wars begin when you decide, but do not end when you please.\" China is aware that any use of force, even limited, is unlikely to lead to a de-escalation, or far from it, a resolution. Rather, the most likely consequence of a Chinese attack on Indian troops would be a counterattack, leading to escalation and war. Because New Delhi knows that if the Indian troops flee when Chinese mortals rain on them, it would in effect be telling its northern neighbour that it could be cowed into submission.\n\nAlthough the Chinese media have claimed that Chinese leadership may not tolerate the presence of Indian troops in Dokalam for long, it is yet to issue an explicit threat of war. The Chinese Foreign Ministry at best said that the Indian soldiers should withdraw from its territory to prevent escalation and that China will defend its sovereignty \"at all costs\". In other words, the Chinese leadership is yet to say: withdraw or face war.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period", "wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "241"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53280"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65436"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304013", "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305325", "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307780", "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "309709"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "324130", "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol\u00f2_Machiavelli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "328953", "label": {"eng": "Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Times", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "351254", "label": {"eng": "Global Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "353687", "label": {"eng": "Territorial disputes in the South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "367381", "label": {"eng": "History of India"}}]}

In your opinion, what are the differences between the two countries' attitudes over the border issue?\n\nMaxwell: The border between China and India has never been settled. This is the fundamental point you have to keep in mind.\n\nThere is a diplomatic process by which a border or frontier is turned into a boundary.\n\nNow, in all the thousands of kilometers between India and China, there is no agreed sector as most of it was unsettled and all of it is disputed.\n\nBoth sides have different views of where the border should lie.\n\nIndia maintains that it has the right to decide where its borders lie by consulting history, myth and the current situation. It hopes the line they actual control becomes the border.\n\nChina, on the other hand, has many more neighbors. China has 14 different states bordering it. And very early on, China determined that it must negotiate with its neighbors to find agreed compromise lines. That was the opposite approach to the one which India followed.\n\nIndia decided it would itself find its borders and impose them. The Chinese much more wisely decided we must discuss with our neighbors and agree by a process of compromise where our boundary lies.\n\nNow the result is that of the 14 different nation states which border China, 12 of them have settled their borders with China, and the two outstanding ones are India and Bhutan.\n\nWhy? Because they refuse to negotiate. Each one insists, \"We will tell you where the border lies,\" which makes a settlement unreachable. The border quarrel between India and China has never been resolved.\n\nGT: In your book you mentioned that India has the mentality of an innocent victim. This has been a shadow over India since the 1962 border war with China. Why does this shadow linger?\n\nMaxwell: Because of the bitter humiliation of the defeat.\n\nIndia, in 1962, went to war with China expecting victory, but in one month, that dream was broken and India suffered a complete humiliating defeat. Now that leaves a deep mark on the political class of the country and the bitterness of the defeat in 1962 became a lasting wound in the consciousness of the Indian political elites.\n\nAnd from that bitterness comes a hankering or wish for revenge. That is a very dangerous habit in the Indian political structure.\n\nThe feeling may be that there should be a second round in which this time India would triumph. It's a dangerous psychological malady, particularly in the military.\n\nThe generation who fought the war against China realized that India had provoked the conflict, but the new generation of Indian soldiers are ignorant of that. They just see themselves as having perhaps one day the chance to take revenge against China.\n\nThe Indian public and Indian intelligence were both told by the government that India had suffered surprise unprovoked aggression from China, \"a stab in the back.\"\n\nThis was a false explanation given to the fact that the Indian government under Jawaharlal Nehru had taken the country into a war against a superior military power, the result of which was inevitably defeat.\n\nBut that could not be confessed by Nehru. It had to be disguised with the lie that China has suddenly attacked India. The Indian people, the Indian political class have been deluded into a mistaken belief.\n\nGT: Your book has been regarded as an authoritative work upon the Sino-India border issue. The book was published in the 1970s, and at that time, I think the whole world stood by India against China. Why was that?\n\nMaxwell: The US was keeping the People's Republic of China as an outlaw. It did not represent China and the Kuomintang was still China.\n\nThe Indians had the support of the West because everyone believed that China was an outlaw state. So, when India said we have suffered aggression from China, the West was willing to believe that.\n\nGT: The Sikkim section of the China-India boundary was defined by the Convention Between Great Britain and China Relating to Sikkim and Tibet in 1890. The Indian government has repeatedly confirmed that in written forms since India's independence, recognizing that it concurs with China on the boundary alignment at the Sikkim section. This time, Indian troops entered China through this area, and India's excuse to enter China is that China is building a road in that area. And that the road is close to the Siliguri Corridor. How do you view this?\n\nMaxwell: That is not an acceptable explanation. There should be no surprise that China has reacted violently. It is an intrusion into Chinese territory. But it should not be allowed to escalate into armed conflict. I don't think that this will spark into a war between the two sides. I think neither really wishes to see a war.\n\nGT: There have been so many confrontations between China and India through thousands of years. Even some skirmishes.\n\nMaxwell: But fortunately, no one has pulled a trigger.\n\nGT: But this time, it's a little different, because there is another small country of Southeast Asia involved, Bhutan.\n\nMaxwell: I don't agree that is a major factor. It is a minor difference in form without a change in reality. The essence is this is a clash between India and China. Bhutan is a puppet of India.\n\nBhutan naturally would wish to be on good terms with both its huge neighbors, with China and with India. Bhutan has no diplomatic relations with China, because India will not allow it to open diplomatic relations, because the Indian government controls Bhutan with troops inside Bhutan.\n\nGT: Is there any basis in international law for India to take control over Bhutan?\n\nMaxwell: No, but with nearly 15,000 troops in Bhutan, India has complete control.\n\nIndia has troops in Bhutan. Bhutan could just speak up in the United Nations and complain about this, but they don't. They acquiesce in their position under Indian suzerain authority. They have no choice.\n\nGT: Given the ongoing standoff in the Doklam region, can you give some suggestions on how China should deal with India?\n\nMaxwell: Patience and reason. Make clear to India that it is a matter of vital concern to China. Be patient and trust good things will prevail, if the Indian government will not do anything further to provoke a conflict. Play it cool. Make clear that is a dangerous situation.\n\nGT: It seems funny, over dozens of years, China did not take India as a main competitor or the enemy. We always take India as a friend because we both belong to the Third World. But it seems that India was always telling China, \"No, I'm your enemy.\"\n\nMaxwell: Because the Indians were misled into believing that in 1962, they suffered an attack from China. The truth is the other way. They still do not believe it. They still believe they are the victims of 1962.\n\nGT: China is stronger than India. If there is another war between India and China, it would be very destructive. But China will win the war because China is a stronger country. Do you think so?\n\nMaxwell: I agree, but the Indians will not agree.\n\nGT: It seems Indians are very confident.

With soldiers from both sides digging in, the consequences of this confrontation remain unpredictable. On China's India-specific attitude, I will start with the Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China Border Areas signed in1993. As a senior Army officer then, I was involved in discussions regarding military confidence-building measures with China, as well as advising Bhutan on the India-Bhutan-China border issues. Para 2 of the agreement stated: 'The two sides agree to reduce their military forces along the LAC in conformity with the requirements of the principle of mutual and equal security to ceilings to be mutually agreed. The extent, depth, timing and nature of the reduction of the military along the LAC shall be determined through mutual consultations between the two countries. The reduction of military forces shall be carried out by stages in mutually agreed geographical locations sector-wise within the areas along the LAC.' However, after the agreement, despite our best efforts, China backed out on the delineation or disclosure of its perception of the LAC, which had to be the start point for any troop reduction or relocation by either side. In 1996, during an official visit to China, I called on Gen Chi Haotian, then defence minister, and raised this issue. He not only brushed it aside, but also displayed his annoyance. I felt then -- and do so now -- that China wants to settle India-China boundary issue on its own terms, at some opportune time. China's aggressive approach towards India began in the late 2000. It opposed nuclear exemption for India at the NSG, as it opposes India's membership of the NSG now. Despite the political acceptance of Sikkim's status within India, China has made attempt to create ambiguity on this issue. It started issuing 'paper visa' to travellers from J&K and Arunachal Pradesh. In the recent past, several incursions have been attempted in Ladakh. The Chumar incident took place when Chinese President Xi Jinping was being feted in India. China has refused to declare Masood Azhar as a global terrorist despite near unanimity in the UN on this issue. Beijing stopped bothering about India's sensitivities when it began to use its economic and military clout to influence and wean away India's South Asian neighbours. Its embrace of Pakistan has got tighter. China is now an integral part of India-Pakistan disputes. It took no notice when India objected to CPEC passing through the disputed territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, but felt insulted when India did not attend the OBOR jambooree in Beijing. With its string of pearls strategy, and CPEC entry to the Arabian Sea, its influence in the Indian Ocean and its littorals is expected to rise sharply. Doklam has been an 'accepted' disputed area between Bhutan and China since the 1980s. When China started road construction -- a unilateral attempt to change the status quo in the area -- Bhutan called for India's help under the purview of India-Bhutan Friendship Treaty of 2007. India's action is also in its own national interest. If allowed to be completed, this road would not only extinguish Bhutan's claim over Doklam, but also improve Chinese reach to India's narrow Siliguri corridor. Yet another obvious purpose is to dent the good relations between India and Bhutan. Now to the larger, global perspective of China. Paul Kennedy in his book The Rise and Fall of Great Powers stated that 'Long-term shifts in economic productivity of nations are co-terminus with the increase or decrease of their global influence'. After developing its economy and military power, China is now emerging as a revisionist, expansionist and a combative power; its 'peaceful rise' stage seems to be over. Under Jinping, it is pursuing a strong domestic national identity and the dream of once again becoming the Middle Kingdom. China has running territorial disputes with many countries, including India, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines and Vietnam. In the process, it has started asserting dubious claims, bullying smaller nations and adopting a defiant attitude like the one on the International Tribunal award over the South China Sea. In redrawing borders and expanding spheres of influence, China is indulging in cartographic subjectivity. History and selective interpretation of colonial-era decisions are quoted in accordance with its own prerogatives -- China rejects McMahon Line with India as a colonial era accord, but accepts this line as a boundary with Myanmar. And now it cites the 1890 Anglo-Sikkim Convention in the case of India-China-Bhutan tri-junction in Chumbi Valley. India has displayed accommodation and timidity in dealing with China's numerous provocations -- its territorial claims, encroachments, nexus with Pakistan, supporting insurgencies inside India, trade imbalance, violation of bilateral agreements and opposing India's vital interests in multilateral forums. After Doklam, this attitude may change. Any display of weakness will not only encourage Chinese coercion and bluster, but also impact India's relations and credibility in South, Southeast and East Asia. India will need to carry out a holistic review of its China policy. In the last two months, China has made several military threats. Keeping in view the nuclear status of both countries and geopolitical sensitivities involved, I doubt if there can be a high intensity India-China armed conflict. A major armed skirmish in Chumbi Valley is also unlikely. The geography here places serious operational disadvantage to China. The scope of any limited conflict/skirmish can be expected to shift to the less accessible areas in Ladakh, Central Sector or Arunachal Pradesh, where it has better mobility and logistic advantages. Yet, another option China could adopt is to restart helping India's secessionist elements in the North-East and along the Siliguri corridor. Or to use its cyber capabilities to damage any national-level IT-enabled systems. It would then be able to cause greater intimidation without going to war. While preferring a solution through a dialogue on equal terms, India must be prepared for all eventualities. There is considerable asymmetry in power potential between China and India. Without getting into an arms race, India must start thinking strategically to cope with China's power. Doklam is a wakeup call to look at our defence capabilities and infrastructure along the LAC and to review the long comatose military transformation.\n\nThe writer is a former Army Chief All readers are invited to post comments responsibly.

The move comes at a time when the two Asian giants have been locked in a military standoff over Doklam for almost two months, leading many to believe that India is considering trade sanctions on the IT imports from the land of the red dragon.\n\nIndia's growing electronics and IT industry are hugely depended on Chinese products with the current valuation of tech imports from China reaching nearly $22 billion, according to a recent study by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). While New Delhi is looking at reducing dependency on China for India's requirement in electronics manufacturing, possibilities of Beijing gaining unlawful access to the country's critical infrastructure information have also likely prompted the Narendra Modi-led BJP government to review IT imports from China.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the West Lake State Guest House ahead of G20 Summit in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, September 4, 2016Reuters file\n\n\"There are increasing concerns about the preparedness of the security apparatus, especially as there are fears that electronics, online trade platforms, and finished goods can be tapped into for procuring sensitive information,\" industry sources told Times of India.\n\nConcerns over online security threats\n\nSome of the most popular imported goods from China include mobile phones, medical equipment, telecom network gear and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The concern here is that these devices may transmit or store data back into Chinese servers, which could pose a major security risk to India amid increasing tensions at the Sikkim border.\n\nIn addition to tackling potential security threats, the Indian government may also be looking at narrowing the huge trade deficit with China. In the fiscal 2016-17, India's trade deficit with China contracted slightly to $51.08 billion from $52.69 billion in 2015-16. In 2014-15, the figure was $48.48 billion.\n\nMany in the anti-China brigade want domestically-made products to replace Chinese goods in India. According to some, it's time for India to use trade as a political weapon against China, whose annual trade surplus with India is reportedly large enough to help it finance one China-Pakistan Economic Corridor every calendar year.\n\nAmid mounting tensions, should India use trade as a weapon against China?REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo\n\n\"India's most powerful weapon against China is trade. Given China's proclivity to deploy trade as a political weapon, as against South Korea in the latest case, why doesn't India take a page out of the Chinese playbook?,\" asked Brahma Chellaney, a strategic studies professor at New Delhi's Centre for Policy Research.\n\nBut the question is whether the Indian government can ignore the strategic role that China plays in India's growth.\n\nCan India ban IT imports from China?\n\nIn the fiscal 2016-17, nearly 16 percent of the country's imports, by value, reportedly came directly from China while less than 4 percent of India's exports went there.\n\nWhen it comes to both electrical and electronic products, including mobile phones and parts, laptops and populated circuit boards, the combined value of such imports from China by India in 2016-17 was about $7.8 billion. Although India's movement towards digitalisation of services and trade demands heightened security in the country's online infrastructure, banning Chinese IT imports or boycotting such products could hurt initiatives like Digital India.\n\nDemonstrators shout slogans during a protest organised by the activists of Swadeshi Jagran Manch, a wing of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), as they demand the boycott of Chinese products, in New Delhi, India, October 26, 2016.REUTERS/Adnan Abidi\n\nCommerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said last month that India can't impose \"a blanket ban\" on all imports from China due to guidelines set by the World Trade Organisation.\n\n\"Just because we may not like certain things about a country is not reason enough to block imports from that country. We could impose anti-dumping duties, but there are established ways to go about it and dumping has to be proved,\" Sitharaman said.\n\nOn Tuesday, India indeed imposed anti-dumping duties on 93 Chinese products, which triggered sharp responses from state media, which urged local firms to \"reconsider the risks\" of investing in India.\n\n\"China could easily retaliate with restrictions on Indian products, but that doesn't make much economic sense for the country,\" an article on the Global Times, a Chinese news publication, said. \"If India really starts a trade war with China, of course China's economic interests will be hurt, but there will also be consequences for India.\"", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "wgt": 100, "id": 828, "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51861"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Zhejiang Sheng"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zhejiang Sheng"}, "type": "loc", "id": "63613"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hangzhou"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hangzhou"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65046"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65436"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306107", "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "308732", "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "309347", "label": {"eng": "World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "309717", "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-20_major_economies", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312149", "label": {"eng": "G-20 major economies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330537", "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "388716", "label": {"eng": "Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Policy_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "548114", "label": {"eng": "Centre for Policy Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013Pakistan_Economic_Corridor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1270037", "label": {"eng": "China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1271446", "label": {"eng": "Digital India"}}]}

Public statements made by Indian and Chinese leaders, the media, and intellectuals over the standoff reflect the level of rivalry. Indian policy is directed towards East, Central and West Asia, while China is connecting continents with the Belt and Road Initiative. The treaties and agreements between India and China go back to historical times, ranging from the 1890 Anglo-China Agreement on Sikkim and Tibet to the latest 2013 Border Defence Cooperation Agreement. Treaties with Bhutan and Nepal, like the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between India and Nepal and the 2007 revised friendship treaty between India and Bhutan are also relevant.\n\nJapan, India, China, South Korea and Asean countries are emerging as world growth centres, more than six decades after the end of colonialism in Asia. New connections are being shaped and old ones redrawn by the big powers to meet their own strategic needs. Sikkim's merger with India in 1975 is one example. Bhutan's defence and diplomacy being assured by India is another. Nepal's Maoist conflict ended with the 12-point agreement that affirmed major changes in Nepal. The country was transformed into a secular and federal republic. The standoff at Doklam, strategically situated at the tri-junction of Bhutan, China and India, is less significant, but accepting the larger strategic game changer is imperative for smaller states like Nepal to move towards prosperity and stability.\n\nTwo emerging powers\n\nAfter the 1940s, both China and India faced challenges of the rich getting richer and the rise of the poor; border disputes resulting in three conflicts; trade imbalance in favour of China; China's strategic relations with Pakistan; concerns of the Indian military; economic activities in the South China Sea; and terrorism. China is going through a transition. It was a majestic world economic power till 2008, but it is no longer so as its exports have fallen and social concerns have emerged. India is growing at a fast pace. Now, both countries have to legitimise their strength by showing they are powerful; they have to make minimal moves around their frontiers for internal reasons.\n\nChina is also concerned with gaining access to the Indian Ocean, therefore showing that, apart from political agendas, geopolitics is also a key concern.These are natural movements of great powers against each other. China is India's largest trading partner. Both countries have concentrated on their internal transformation, and they have been the greatest beneficiaries of the end of the Cold War and the security order led by the US. Second, the US enabled China's rise through this period as it became integrated with the global order. It is more likely to become like the West economically, politically and militarily as an actor on the international stage. Third, China's rise marked the rise of Asia and the Chinese arms build-up. China led the way followed by Malaysia, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and others. Despite having the most boundary disputes in the world between them, the border between China and India has been relatively calm.\n\nThe perceived encircling of both China and India is a factor, with India being encircled by the String of Pearls and China being encircled by the US, India and their allies. Tensions between the US and Russia are on the rise once more despite a flurry of diplomatic activity between Moscow and Washington in recent weeks. Russia's policy towards South Asia has been a topic of much conjecture recently. It is becoming more and more obvious that Russia is moving away from its India-centric approach in the region.\n\nThe real issue is geography; getting to either side of the Himalayan Ranges is significant to both China and India as the balance of power will shift. Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan play significant roles in this geopolitical game. The wall is the Himalaya and getting across is important for both. The Chinese are working to cross the Himalaya and push southwards to the sea. Even if this is not possible now, it surely will be in the next five decades. The Indian Ocean is significant for regional and trans-regional outreach for China. The South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca and associated maritime infrastructure such as naval launch pads play an important role in the development of the 21st century Maritime Silk Road initiative to promote its geo-political, geo-economic and geo-strategic interests.\n\nCooperation key to harness resources\n\nIn recent years, fear of China's moves in the east and the South China Sea was the leading catalyst for the noteworthy presence of the US armed forces and the freedom of navigation operation near contested islands off the Philippines and Vietnam. Natural resources are at the centre of various Asian conflicts. The East China Sea is the centre of conflict between China and Japan due to its immense hydrocarbon resources. All except one of Asia's major river systems originate in Tibet. Yet, Asia's per capita fresh water availability is not even half the global average. Water in the 21st century will become what oil was in the 20th century, a source of both wealth and conflict.\n\nThe primary outlook on Sino-Indian relations is the impression that two rising powers with rapidly growing economies and global ambitions cannot coexist peacefully since the area of interest and persuasion extends beyond competition, as in the case of Nepal and other bordering states. As for hostility, whoever is on the defence is going to be stronger as it is extremely difficult to conduct military actions in the Himalayan region. Maintaining supply lines across hostile environments will be easier said than done for both countries regardless of whether they move south or north of their existing border.\n\nChina and India must recognise that war and making peace are two different things; precious lessons can be drawn from previous wars. A diplomatic approach must take precedence, if not, a void between country relations can come into sight. Foresight is desirable to stay away from such a scenario. China or India may win the war, but they may also lose control of the peace. As a result, Nepal should develop a policy that addresses the interests of both countries and keeps its own interest at the core, because potential conflict between the two nuclear powers could throw Nepal and the region into chaos.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Indonesia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "100"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "158"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "168"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "178"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Republic of Vietnam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "241"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51861"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303329", "label": {"eng": "Silk Road"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303540"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304148", "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312273", "label": {"eng": "Himalayas"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "313490"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "322091", "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323659", "label": {"eng": "East China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "323660", "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "328834", "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013India_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "390501", "label": {"eng": "China\u2013India relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Malacca", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "472344", "label": {"eng": "Strait of Malacca"}}]}

It is worrying to see the kind of coverage that this incident has generated. Practically, every analyst seems to have war on his mind and they have been taking lot of pleasure in painting various scenarios. Television channels have been running operational discussions and some analysts from the West have been painting war scenarios and working on games theory. It appears the whole world would be happy to see India and China go to war. Needless to say, most of the people, covering the issue, do not know the Doklam area well.\n\nSome reporters and analysts have written about the three warfares. Readers would recall a series of articles on that subject published by Defence Aviation Post. It is quite likely that China has put into action the three warfares technique.\n\nThe frequent question that one hears everywhere in India these days is that whether there will be a war between India and China. War is a very serious business and it should not be thought of in a cavalier manner like this. Fates of countries and societies change due to wars. One does not have go far to realise this. Let us take our minds back to the 1962 War.\n\nThough the Indian Armed Forces alone cannot be blamed for the outcome of that war, it worked on their minds in addition to that of politicians, bureaucrats, diplomats and people of India, for almost three decades. This affected the bilateral relations between India and China adversely. Thankfully, it is fading away. Similarly, the result of 1971 war is still hurting all Pakistanis. The century of fumiliation has been on the minds of the Chinese and that may be a reason for the present stand-off in Doklam.\n\nComing on to Doklam issue, the rhetoric from the Chinese side shows no signs of abating. Media picked up and flashed a statement by Hu Zhiyong, a research fellow at the Institute of International Relations at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, that China will launch an operation in two weeks and India's Ministry of External Affairs will be informed prior to that. China put out a 15-page fact sheet, incorporating all statements that were made earlier.\n\nHowever, it failed to address the queries raised by India, Bhutan and others. On August 10, Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo of Academy of Military Sciences wrote an article with a veiled threat to India in the People's Liberation Army website. It was not available in English. Many such articles have appeared for local audience in China. The spokesperson also put out reports saying that 48 Indian Army soldiers and one dozer were present in Chinese territory on the last day of July. Approximately one week later, he said 53 personnel and one dozer are still there in the Chinese territory.\n\nIt appears that China's strategy is not to let this issue go away from the media, its population and international glare. This is also one of the rare occasions in which China is trying to defend its action through various means by putting out a map and photograph first and there after the white paper. All-China Journalists Association hosted some Indian journalists to convey their view point. However, all these have been efforts to convey China's position in a unilateral manner. It seems to be oblivious to the fact that there are others who have different positions to China's on this issue.\n\nBhutan's Foreign Ministry, while speaking to the news agency, ANI, mentioned that Doklam belongs to Bhutan which was contrary to what Wang Wenli, Deputy Director General of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated. This statement put paid to some sceptics who claimed that the statement issued by Bhutan on June 29 was under coercion from India. India's reaction has been consistent. It has been one of quiet, calm, firm and mature diplomacy.\n\nThe reaction to China's White Paper on Doklam issue was a simple statement that \"India considers that peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas is an important prerequisite for smooth development of our bilateral relations with China\" and mentioned that there is no change to the June 30 statement issued by it.\n\nA section of analysts have started feeling that it may be alright for India to pull back to give an option to China. Tactically that may be sustainable. But it will have disastrous consequences. Second, they will do well to remember that China respects strength and abhors weakness. Any show of weakness will be detrimental for all our future negotiations with China. It is not only about Doklam but also about the larger India-China relations.\n\nAs per reports, a major general level flag meeting held at Nathula on August 11 remained inconclusive. There were also reports that the Indian side suggested Chinese troops withdraw 250 m from their present positions that was rejected by Wang Wenli. He also asked how India will feel if China enters Kalapani area which is located at the tri-juntion of India, Nepal and China.\n\nOne is not sure whether India suggested such a thing. Both sides have mentioned that normal diplomatic channels have been functioning. Sushma Swaraj, India's Foreign Minister, has made two statements saying war is not an option but diplomatic solution is. All these indicate to the fact that despite the rhetoric, diplomatic discussions have been going on to resolve the issue.\n\nAs suggested by this writer in an earlier article, simultaneous phased withdrawal by both sides will be a workable solution. For that, the Chinese side has to accept that any changes to the area of tri-junctions need the concurrence of all the three countries involved. That may not be a difficult thing to do as it was a party to the understanding reached in 2012 regarding the tri-junction areas.\n\nIf China's spokespersons and some of its media continue to throw barbs at India, it will make it difficult for both sides to come to a solution to the present crisis. Since both the sides have taken strong positions, the Doklam issue is likely to take longer to get resolved. As the efforts to resolve this issue go on, it will also be prudent to get into an agreement to avoid such incidents in future.\n\nAs we celebrated the 71st anniversary of our Independence, we need to thank the officers and men who have braved harsh weather and terrain conditions to stand their ground not only at Doklam but all along our borders to ensure territorial integrity and sovereignty of our motherland.\n\nReaders may recall that we had started a series on One Belt One Road (OBOR). Doklam incident has overshadowed all other things. It is time to return to other important things and take the glare away from this incident which may actually facilitate resolving the issue. Therefore, heads up for the next part of the OBOR series.\n\n(Courtesy: Defence Aviation Post)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Archaeology", "wgt": 100, "id": 430, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Archaeology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "168"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "64265"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308761", "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309272", "label": {"eng": "Indian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319077", "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Army"}, "type": "loc", "id": "326389"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushma_Swaraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342477", "label": {"eng": "Sushma Swaraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013India_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "390501", "label": {"eng": "China\u2013India relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathu_La", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "431027", "label": {"eng": "Nathu La"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "483644", "label": {"eng": "Sino-Indian War"}}]}

The Chinese are at their belligerent and ballistic best (worst) - both in their unprecedented, (un)diplomatic language calling our foreign minister a \"liar\", asking India \"to come to senses\", reminding us of 1962 - and issuing threats of war.\n\nWhere is Doklam?\n\nDoklam, or Donglang as the Chinese prefer to call it, is in the eastern Himalayan mountain ranges at an altitude of about 16,000 feet, where due to lack of sufficient oxygen troops need acclimatisation for survival, and carriage of heavy arms and fighting at these heights is extremely strenuous.\n\nLocation and topography\n\nDoklam plateau, about 80-85 sqkm in area, is Bhutanese territory, connects with Chumbi valley in the north with Tibet (China) and in north-west with Sikkim (India). Hence this plateau has strategic significance for Bhutan, India and China.\n\nHistorical perspective\n\nChina claims that Doklam (Bhutan) was under the Quing dynasty's rule in the past, and Bhutan used to pay taxes to them. China follows the policy of \"once mine, always mine\", and as the famous historian Dr Majumdar said: \"There is, however, one aspect of Chinese culture that is little known outside the circle of professional historians. It is the characteristic of China that if a region once acknowledged her normal suzerainty even for a short period, she should regard it as part of her empire forever and would automatically revive her claim over it even after a thousand years whenever there was a chance of enforcing it.\"\n\nIn 1890, the Chinese signed a treaty with the British, without any consultations or participation by Tibet, Bhutan or Sikkim, and on the basis of their bilateral treaty with the British, they claim Doklam as theirs!\n\nThe Tibetan government refused to accept the treaty and the British sent an expedition to Tibet in 1904, but the problem remained unresolved till 1960.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, China has officially acknowledged the various areas of dispute including the Doklam plateau with Bhutan, despite 24 rounds of negotiations held so far. It has formally been agreed to by China and India in 2012 that the tri-junction points between India, China and third countries will be finalised in consultation with the countries concerned.\n\nA treaty of friendship exists between Bhutan and India since 1949 (revised in 2007) sharing a special relationship which gives both the right to use each other's territory for \"activities harmful to the national security and interests of the other\" and a clear understanding of India's commitment to \"protect\" Bhutan in case of external aggression!\n\nAs stated by Brahma Challaney, \"Bhutan was not a party to the 1890 accord which, in any case, identifies the watershed principle for defining the boundary. The highest ridge line separating river flows runs through Batang-la, not Mount Gipmochi, making Doklam part of Bhutan.\"\n\nWhy is Doklam important to India?\n\nThe implications are strategic. First, it poses a constant threat to Sikkim (India) next door; secondly an offensive via Rangpo river and Kalimpong into Arunachal Pradesh - already being claimed by China as \"Southern Tibet\" and hence Chinese territory - is a possibility, and thirdly the threat to the Siliguri (chicken's neck) corridor which has the potential to cut the only Indian access to its north-eastern states is a possibility, though the rough and rugged mountainous terrain further hindered by lack of roads will make these options extremely difficult for the Chinese, especially with adequate Indian forces deployed to deter such misadventures. But military prudence demands that India should deny such ingress routes.\n\nNeighbour's bully, China\n\nEverybody knows China's a bully. Photo: Reuters\n\nChina has annexed/claimed territory from almost all its neighbours: Xinjiang and Tibet (annexed), about 40,000 sqkm of land in Aksai chin (Ladakh, roughly the size of Switzerland), claims the Spratly islands (Vietnam), Mischief reef (Philippines), Senkatu islands (Japan) and Taiwan and with USSR claiming 52,000 sqkm of Tajikistan, in 1969.\n\nPsychological war - bullying India\n\n\"The supreme art of war\", argued by well-known Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu (some 2,500 years ago), is to subdue the enemy without fighting. \"Supreme excellence\", he said, \"consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting\".\n\nWhen China arrived at Doklam they probably did not anticipate the strong Bhutanese and Indian reaction and the will to stand up to China, a bully. Having thus boxed themselves into a corner, they are desperate and this probably explains their unprecedented, undiplomatic and open war threats!\n\nInterim encounters/standoffs\n\nSince 1962 till date, China has resorted to posturing/encounters/standoffs and even limited aggression to intimidate our troops, using loudspeakers constantly reminding them of the 1962 debacle!\n\nIn 1965, during the India-Pakistan war, the Chinese warned us to vacate two of the passes - Nathu La and Jalep La- and later in September 1967 in a battle that lasted for six days suffered an estimated 300 military casualties, against our own 65 dead and 145 injured. In the 1980s, their threat was met firmly by us in Sumdorongchu by movement of brigade-level troops.\n\nFinancial implications\n\nThe defence ministry has sought an \"urgent\" additional allocation of Rs 20,000 crore for \"combat readiness, military modernisation and day-to-day operating costs\" from the Union government in addition to the Rs 2.74 lakh crore allocated for defence in the 2017-2018 budget!\n\nIt is worthwhile to remember that the present year's budget and ad hoc allotments for defence are necessitated to make up for failure and cumulative neglect to equip even the minimum essential requirements for an Army which has been fighting a \"two-and-a-half\" war/enemies for decades.\n\nHindering the Army, assisting our enemies\n\nOn March 12, 2012, a very detailed letter written by then Chief of Army Staff himself about the existing deficiencies in arms and equipment affecting fighting capabilities adversely (authentic top secret information, meant only for the eyes of the PM), was leaked to the media by an irresponsible bureaucrat, and I won't be surprised if the Chinese bravado is based on their military assessment of such critical shortage!\n\nIt must be realised that both China and Pakistan would have willingly spent crores of rupees to get such vast and accurate intelligence about the precise aspects of the Indian Army's critical shortage of arms and ammunition and we shared it for free, with the person responsible for such gross negligence going unpunished.\n\nTo add to the Army's woes - with the Chinese threatening war - the CAG released its report last month announcing to the Chinese (and the Pakistanis) - \"No 'significant' Progress In 3 Years: Auditor On Army Ammunition Shortage\".\n\nThe CAG report said that of the 152 types of ammunition used by the military, availability of 55 per cent of the types was below the minimum inescapable requirement for operational preparedness. For another 40 per cent types of ammunitions, the Army had a stock for less than 10 days!\n\nThe irony is that the CAG was himself the defence secretary in his previous avatar and hence it is extremely unfortunate that he released such sensitive intelligence in the open, when China is threatening war.\n\nIndian response\n\nThe Indian armed forces of today are no \"pushovers\" and with full knowledge about the terrain advantage being in their favour, the Indian government's quiet, confident yet restrained and free-of-jingoism approach seems to be unnerving the Chinese, both the ruling elite and the media.\n\nAlso read: China wants war with India, make no mistake\n\n#CAG, #1962 War, #Bhutan, #India-China Ties The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.\n\nThe two most populous countries in the world are dangerously close to armed conflict. Both are fast-growing and ambitious nations with something to prove -- and they have nuclear weapons. Yet you'll find surprisingly little discussion of the issue in Washington, where President Trump's ongoing controversies and the threat of terrorist attacks (more on the horrific attack in Barcelona later in the newsletter) continue to dominate the discussion.\n\nThe military standoff between India and China over a remote plateau in the Himalayas has been going on for months now. This week, The Post's Annie Gowen and Simon Denyer took a look at the complicated dispute, which was sparked by China's move to build a road in territory claimed by Bhutan, a close ally of India that does not have formal diplomatic relations with Beijing.\n\nTerritorial disputes between in the area are far from new -- India and China briefly went to war over contest territory in 1962. And much of the present dispute dates back to an 1890 border agreement made between British India and China's Qing Dynasty, one of a number of lingering problems caused by colonial cartographers.\n\nBut experts say the current standoff is the worst in decades and has taken on a different tone than previous flare-ups. \"It would be very complacent to rule out escalation,\" Shashank Joshi, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London, told The Post. \"It's the most serious crisis in India-China relations for 30 years.\"\n\nHere's how Chinese troops tried to deal with a previous standoff with India in 2013. (Associated Press)\n\nBoth India and China are speaking openly and seriously of armed conflict, with Beijing's state media striking a indigent and at times uncharacteristically vulgar tone. An English-language video posted by the Xinhua news agency Wednesday accused India of \"trampling international law\" and \"inventing various excuses to whitewash its illegal moves\" -- before showing a Chinese actor in a Sikh turban who spoke in an insulting Indian accent.\n\nIf India and China were to go to war, it would be no small matter. Over 2.6 billion people live in the two nations. Between them, they are estimated to have 380 nuclear weapons (though both China and India subscribe to a \"no first use\" policy, which should -- hopefully -- mean they wouldn't be used in such any conflict).\n\nIn a briefing last month, the U.S. State Department urged restraint. During a press briefing last week, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, \"It's a situation that we have certainly followed closely. And as you know, we have relationships with both governments. We continue to encourage both parties to sit down and have conversations about that.\"\n\nThe dispute centers not only on the territory in question -- an obscure, 34-square-mile area known as the Dolam Plateau that is claimed by both Bhutan and China -- but a narrow strip of strategically important Indian land called the Siliguri Corridor. This tract, unaffectionately nicknamed the \"chicken's neck,\" connects the bulk of the India with its remote east. Delhi has long feared Chinese troops could cut across the corridor if war broke out, effectively cutting the country in half. It's not an unreasonable fear, given that the region is just 14 miles wide at its thinnest point; Ankit Panda of the Diplomat once dubbed it a \"terrifyingly vulnerable artery in India's geography.\"\n\nIt is widely assumed that Washington would side with India in the dispute. Trump is a frequent critic of China, and some in his administration have pushed for tough responses to other territorial claims made by Beijing, such as the ongoing disputes in the South China Sea. Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on India's Independence Day this week, which some media outlets interpreted as a gesture of support for New Delhi.\n\nAnd yet, there is a nagging sense among some in India that Trump won't have Modi's back if push comes to shove. \"If ever there was a war with China, America would never come to our rescue,\" one government official told Indian journalist Barkha Dutt recently, according to a story Dutt wrote for The Post's Global Opinion section.\n\nWashington also may be diplomatically limited in the region: A number of key State Department positions that would have responsibility for handling an India-China crisis remain unfilled. Another part of the problem is simply the complexity of the issue, which could prove hard to communicate to a leader with seemingly limited knowledge of the world and a notoriously short attention span.\n\nPresident Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands in the Rose Garden of the White House on June 26. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThere is also an argument that perhaps Trump should keep his nose out of this. The Post's Jackson Diehl wrote he didn't find much enthusiasm for U.S. involvement in the dispute while in Delhi last week. The U.S. president has gained a reputation there for being hotheaded and impulsive -- even the drawdown in tensions with North Korea seems to have happened in spite of his involvement, not because of it.\n\nDiehl noted that Modi had sought a closer relationship with the United States in the hope that Trump would be tough on China and terrorism while forging closer ties to Russia, an old Indian ally. Instead, as Diehl writes, the Indians have received \"contradictions and chaos,\" with some wondering if the White House currently is even capable of handling complicated geopolitical situations.\n\nTo be fair, Trump is not alone in being more interested in the standoff with North Korea or terrorist attacks like the one that took place Thursday in Barcelona. He's also in the midst of his own domestic crises.\n\nHowever, Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution noted recently that the 1962 Indo-Chinese war was resolved with the help of President John F. Kennedy, who used military support for India and clever diplomacy to limit the scope of the conflict. Remarkably, this all happened at the same time as the Cuban missile crisis, the \"most dangerous moment in human history.\" Given that, what is Trump's excuse?\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know?

In New Delhi, Japan's Ambassador to India Kenji Hiramatsu acknowledged that the Doklam area \"is disputed between China and Bhutan,\" countering Beijing's claim that the stand-off was taking place on Chinese sovereign territory. His remarks drew a sharp rebuke from the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, who asserted on Friday that she wanted to \"remind him [the Japanese Ambassador to India] not to randomly make comments before clarifying relevant facts.\"\n\nNepal plays it safe\n\nIn South Asia, Nepal, sharing common borders with India and China, has expressed neutrality on the Doklam standoff, and called for a diplomatic and peaceful solution to the crisis. But in the Asia-Pacific, the Doklam face-off is being conflated with regional contests between China and several members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), including the SCS.\n\n\"The escalating tensions [in Doklam] may have culprits on both sides of the fence, but for many in East Asia it underscores the fact that China is embroiled in multiple territorial disputes across the Eurasian landmass and rim land, \"says Richard J, Heydarian, a Manila-based scholar with the De La Salle University. In an emailed response to The Hindu, he points out that that the Doklam crisis puts to test \"the whole thesis of a 'stable, multipolar' post-American world, since Asia's two giants are now at loggerheads with no side seemingly willing to back off.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP), quoting foreign policy specialists is reporting that the protracted border dispute between China and India in the Himalayas \"has created a 'spillover effect' as China's neighbours become unsettled by its tough handling of the escalating conflict between the two Asian giants.\"\n\nASEAN positive over Indian presence\n\nThe daily points out that the ASEAN \" generally regards a robust Indian presence in the region as a useful deterrent against China, which has been increasingly assertive in its approach to handling territorial issues, as has been the case in the Himalayas.\"\n\nThe newspaper quoted Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an international relations scholar at Bangkok-based Chulalongkorn University, as saying that Thailand \"would see the benefit of China being challenged in the South Asia theatre.\"\n\n\"India's standing up to China can only be a boon for South-East Asian countries even when they don't say so openly,\" he observed. \"Any major power keeping China in check can only yield geopolitical benefits to South-East Asia as the region is wary of China's growing assertiveness.\"\n\nThe daily quoting analysts says that the recent developments \"have wide strategic implications -- pointing to how Asia is increasingly defined by the China-India rivalry and the renewed tensions between the two Asian giants.\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 100, "id": 237, "label":

Estimating outcomes from these visits is, however, more difficult.\n\nTaking the two most recent visits, for example, one can easily see the contrast in outcomes. The U.S. visit was a carefully calibrated one producing few surprises, despite the U.S. President having a reputation of being highly unpredictable. For his part, the Prime Minister charted a time-tested course, concentrating mainly on counter-terrorism and the defence security partnership, avoiding contentious trade-related issues. The naming of the Hizbul Mujahedeen chief as a \"specially designated global terrorist\" and a \"new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals\" were the high points of the counter-terrorism agenda. Reiteration of India's position as a major defence partner and confirmation of the sale of the Guardian Unmanned Aerial System to India, reflected the deepening security and defence cooperation.\n\nIn concrete terms, not much else took place during the visit, despite an oblique reference in the joint statement to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and reiteration of support for \"freedom of navigation\" in the Indo-Pacific. What was most obvious was the U.S. tilt towards transactional rather than strategic aspects.\n\nA clear de-hyphenation\n\nIn the case of Israel, this being the first ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to that country, the euphoria of the standalone visit, de-hyphenating Israel from Palestine, was understandable. It also produced better dividends, including elevation of the India-Israel relationship to the level of a 'strategic partnership'. Israel achieved a major propaganda scoop by getting the Indian Prime Minister to visit the memorial of Theodor Herzl, founding father of the Zionist movement.\n\nThe main focus of the visit was on defence cooperation, joint development of defence products and transfer of technology. Most of the agreements signed related to transfer of technology and innovative technology-related items and India expects to benefit substantially, considering that Israeli export rules are far more flexible than those of the U.S.\n\nBoth countries also expressed a strong commitment to combat terror. The reality, however, is that when the two countries speak of terrorism, they speak of very different things. Iran and Hezbollah are the main targets for Israel, which has little interest in the Afghan Taliban or Pakistan's Lashkar-e-Taiba. For India, it is the latter that matters.\n\nThe euphoria of the visit cannot, however, conceal China's importance for Israel. China is a far bigger investor and trading partner of Israel than India. On this occasion, India and Israel decided to set up a $40 million Innovation Fund to allow Indian and Israeli enterprises to develop innovative technologies and products for commercial applications, but it is clearly dwarfed by the Israel-China comprehensive innovation partnership which has an outlay of $300 million. India and Israel also have differences over China's BRI: Israel is eager to participate in it, unlike India, and possibly views this as an opportunity to develop a project parallel to the Suez Canal.\n\nIt's the neighbours\n\nTwo countries where India's diplomacy, despite the impetus given to it, is currently facing heavy odds are China and Pakistan. China in Asia is already exercising some of the political and economic leverages that the U.S. previously possessed. China has a significant presence in East and Southeast Asia, is steadily enlarging its presence in South Asia, and is also beginning to expand into West Asia. For instance, China's influence in Iran today appears to be at an all-time high, whereas India's influence seems to be diminishing.\n\nIndia has, however, refused to be inveigled by China's blandishments, including the BRI. Nor has it flinched from standing up to Chinese 'bullying', as in the recent instance of the Doklam plateau in Bhutan. Few other countries in Asia are, however, willing or in a position to tangle with China. A divided ASEAN again has provided China with an opportunity to demonstrate its economic and military muscle. Most countries in the region also demonstrate a desire to join China-based initiatives. Even in South Asia, despite India's commanding presence, China has been successful in winning quite a few friends among India's neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\n\nIn the case of Pakistan, the implosion of the state arising from its internal stresses and problems, together with the virtual standoff between India and Pakistan (involving a total cessation of talks or any kind of worthwhile contacts), has enabled the Pakistani Deep State to further entrench itself. India has been left with few options and this is leading to a diplomatic gridlock which does not augur well for India.\n\nAs Pakistan becomes still more deeply mired in problems, its dependence on China is growing. This is contributing to a strategic imbalance in the South Asian region. It is a moot point whether India and Indian diplomacy can do something to rectify matters in this context, but for the present it confronts Indian diplomacy with one more serious dilemma.\n\nNotwithstanding India's efforts, the diplomatic scene vis-\u00e0-vis Russia also could be better. Russia is undergoing a strategic resurgence of sorts, sustained in good measure by the close relations recently established with China. Buoyed by developments in the Ukraine and Crimea, and the uncertainties surrounding U.S. commitment to NATO, the new Russia-China 'strategic congruence' is certain to impact Asia. The problem for India and Indian diplomacy is that at this time India-Russia relations appear less robust than at any time in the past half century.\n\nIndia's 'Act East and Look West' policies have given a new dimension to Indian diplomacy in both East and West Asia. In both regions, however, but especially in West Asia, Indian diplomacy still lacks the nimbleness required to deal with fast-changing situations. In West Asia, despite its long time presence in the region, a 9-million strong diaspora, and the region being its principal source of oil, India is not a major player today. Both Russia and China have overtaken India in the affairs of the region. This is particularly true of Iran where the Russia-China-Iran relationship has greatly blossomed, almost marginalising India's influence.\n\nFadeout in West Asia\n\nIndia's absence from, and its inability to play a role in, West Asia, even as the region confronts a split down the line between the Arab and the non-Arab world is unfortunate. More so, there is the possibility of a series of confrontations between an increasingly powerful Shiite Iran and a weakening Saudi Arabia. The most recent challenge is the one posed by Qatar to the existing order in the West Asian region. The fallout of all this will impact India adversely and Indian diplomacy's inability to make its presence felt will matter. An additional concern for India would be that growing uncertainties in the region could further fuel radical Islamist terror in the region.\n\nThe 'Act East' policy has produced better results. Closer relations with countries in East and South East Asia, especially Japan and Vietnam, are a positive development. However, in the Asia-Pacific, India has to contend with an increasingly assertive China. There is little evidence to show that India's diplomatic manoeuvres individually, or with allies like Japan, have succeeded in keeping the Chinese juggernaut at bay -- or for that matter provide an alternative to China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIndia's diplomatic establishment is all too aware of the political history and economics of the Asian region. Under Prime Minister Modi, diplomatic styles have changed but it would seem that the substance has altered little. His recent visit to Israel was, no doubt, a resounding success, but Israel was already one of the very few countries which had shown a complete understanding of India's defence and security needs, even ignoring the sanctions imposed on India by some countries. Israel's supply of critical defence items during the Kargil conflict (of 1999) is an excellent example.\n\nWhat Indian diplomacy currently needs to do is to find a way to steer amid an assertive China, a hostile Pakistan, an uncertain South Asian and West Asian neighbourhood, and an unstable world. The strategic and security implications of these, individually and severally, need to be carefully validated and pursued. Indian diplomacy may possibly need to display still higher levels of sophistication to overcome the odds.\n\nM.K.

Since then, bonhomie has been the last thing on the minds of leaders on the two sides, but the trade relationship has burgeoned. China is India's largest trading partner with the total value of trade at $71.5 billion, surpassing the value of Indo-US trade by more than $6.8 billion. India runs a substantial trade deficit with the Chinese, though its financial dependence on its neighbour is less than in the case of the United States, large chunks of whose sovereign debt is owned by China.\n\nEspecially when soldiers are eyeball-to-eyeball at the border, the composition of this imbalance between the two Asian giants is less significant than the fact that it exists, and China's trade dominance could be a source of disruption if war breaks out.\n\nBlame China for the size of the overall deficit\n\nWith a slowing Chinese economy, India's exports to China have been falling at a CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 6.8% in the past four years. Imports from China, nevertheless, have surged, growing at a CAGR of 4.1%. Consequently India's trade deficit with China has widened to $51 billion in FY17 from $38.7 billion in FY13.\n\nIn fact, out of the total trade deficit of $108 bn (in FY17), China's share was 47%.\n\nWhy China matters to India and not vice versa\n\nIndian local businesses & consumers have more reasons to worry than our exporters. China's share in India's exports stands at a minuscule 3.7% (India's largest market for exports is the U.S. with a share of 15.3%). However, China's share in India's imports stands at 16% which is much more than the share of the second largest exporter, which is U.S. at 6%.\n\nIn fact it is important to remember, that for China, while India is important (with a share of 2.6% in its exports), it nevertheless ranks ninth, with the top slot being occupied by U.S. with a share of 18% in Chinese exports.\n\nWhat do we export to China?\n\nIndia's list of exports to China is dominated by primary products, mostly in the nature of raw materials such as cotton, copper, organic chemicals etc. As the Chinese economy rebalances to become more consumer-led, there will be a further fall in exports.\n\nSo India has got to diversify its exports to cater to affluent Chinese consumers.\n\nWe seem to encounter a \"Made in China\" tag in everything from idols and toys to machinery.\n\nSome home-grown industries have been crying foul for a while, whose markets have been flooded with imports from the neighbour. In many of the genuine cases some kind of protection has been granted.\n\nSo far in close to 93 products from China, anti-dumping duty is in force. This includes chemicals and machinery items imported from China. The other Chinese products on which India has imposed this duty include steel and other metals, fibres and yarn, rubber or plastic, electric and electronics and consumer goods.\n\nIn addition, 40 cases concerning imports from China have been initiated by the Directorate General of Anti-Dumping & Allied Duties. So a section of the industry, can breathe relief for a while.\n\nHence, for selected plays like steel, tyre, chemical etc. this nationalistic protection can lend short to medium term upside.\n\nIndia's imports from China range from consumer electronics such as phones and laptops to nuclear machinery. Other major imports include plastic items, industrial goods, and vehicles. Over half of India's electronic imports come from China. India's toy market is dominated by Chinese firms as well.\n\nIndia's increasing dependence on imports from China for many key raw materials (mostly intermediates and some active pharma ingredients) that go into the making of a number of essential drugs is also worth taking a note of.\n\nWhile many countries in the world run a lopsided trade relation with China, thereby granting it the unchallenged status of the manufacturing hub of the world, for India, the current situation is clearly a wake- up call.\n\nSince a large number of companies import primary raw materials from China, markets should keep these industries/companies under watch. While in the world today economics clearly takes precedence over politics, the criticality of the situation should result in constructive action.Indian government has to give a fillip to domestic manufacturing and walk the talk on \"Make in India\" that will go a long way in de-risking the economy from such one-country sourcing and generate jobs, a dire need of the hour. While most lessons in life are learnt during a crisis, this is no different. Indian policymakers should take note, but in the meanwhile, markets, trading at close to 20X FY18 earnings, need to factor in dark clouds ahead of silver linings.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100, "id": 1930, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical_Intermediates", "wgt": 100, "id": 1931, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Fine-Chemical Intermediates"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "wgt": 100, "id": 1932, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303187", "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303403", "label": {"eng": "Export"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304406", "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307061", "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314116", "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "320064", "label": {"eng": "Economy of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "320370", "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "340167", "label": {"eng": "Foreign relations of India"}}]}

Estimating outcomes from these visits is, however, more difficult.\n\nTaking the two most recent visits, for example, one can easily see the contrast in outcomes. The U.S. visit was a carefully calibrated one producing few surprises, despite the U.S. President having a reputation of being highly unpredictable. For his part, the Prime Minister charted a time-tested course, concentrating mainly on counter-terrorism and the defence security partnership, avoiding contentious trade-related issues. The naming of the Hizbul Mujahedeen chief as a \"specially designated global terrorist\" and a \"new consultation mechanism on domestic and international terrorist designations listing proposals\" were the high points of the counter-terrorism agenda. Reiteration of India's position as a major defence partner and confirmation of the sale of the Guardian Unmanned Aerial System to India, reflected the deepening security and defence cooperation.\n\nIn concrete terms, not much else took place during the visit, despite an oblique reference in the joint statement to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and reiteration of support for \"freedom of navigation\" in the Indo-Pacific. What was most obvious was the U.S. tilt towards transactional rather than strategic aspects.\n\nIn the case of Israel, this being the first ever visit by an Indian Prime Minister to that country, the euphoria of the standalone visit, de-hyphenating Israel from Palestine, was understandable. It also produced better dividends, including elevation of the India-Israel relationship to the level of a 'strategic partnership'. Israel achieved a major propaganda scoop by getting the Indian Prime Minister to visit the memorial of Theodor Herzl, founding father of the Zionist movement.\n\nThe main focus of the visit was on defence cooperation, joint development of defence products and transfer of technology. Most of the agreements signed related to transfer of technology and innovative technology-related items and India expects to benefit substantially, considering that Israeli export rules are far more flexible than those of the U.S.\n\nBoth countries also expressed a strong commitment to combat terror. The reality, however, is that when the two countries speak of terrorism, they speak of very different things. Iran and Hezbollah are the main targets for Israel, which has little interest in the Afghan Taliban or Pakistan's Lashkar-e-Taiba. For India, it is the latter that matters.\n\nThe euphoria of the visit cannot, however, conceal China's importance for Israel. China is a far bigger investor and trading partner of Israel than India. On this occasion, India and Israel decided to set up a $40 million Innovation Fund to allow Indian and Israeli enterprises to develop innovative technologies and products for commercial applications, but it is clearly dwarfed by the Israel-China comprehensive innovation partnership which has an outlay of $300 million. India and Israel also have differences over China's BRI: Israel is eager to participate in it, unlike India, and possibly views this as an opportunity to develop a project parallel to the Suez Canal.\n\nTwo countries where India's diplomacy, despite the impetus given to it, is currently facing heavy odds are China and Pakistan. China in Asia is already exercising some of the political and economic leverages that the U.S. previously possessed. China has a significant presence in East and Southeast Asia, is steadily enlarging its presence in South Asia, and is also beginning to expand into West Asia. For instance, China's influence in Iran today appears to be at an all-time high, whereas India's influence seems to be diminishing.\n\nIndia has, however, refused to be inveigled by China's blandishments, including the BRI. Nor has it flinched from standing up to Chinese 'bullying', as in the recent instance of the Doklam plateau in Bhutan. Few other countries in Asia are, however, willing or in a position to tangle with China. A divided ASEAN again has provided China with an opportunity to demonstrate its economic and military muscle. Most countries in the region also demonstrate a desire to join China-based initiatives. Even in South Asia, despite India's commanding presence, China has been successful in winning quite a few friends among India's neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.\n\nIn the case of Pakistan, the implosion of the state arising from its internal stresses and problems, together with the virtual standoff between India and Pakistan (involving a total cessation of talks or any kind of worthwhile contacts), has enabled the Pakistani Deep State to further entrench itself. India has been left with few options and this is leading to a diplomatic gridlock which does not augur well for India.\n\nAs Pakistan becomes still more deeply mired in problems, its dependence on China is growing. This is contributing to a strategic imbalance in the South Asian region. It is a moot point whether India and Indian diplomacy can do something to rectify matters in this context, but for the present it confronts Indian diplomacy with one more serious dilemma.\n\nNotwithstanding India's efforts, the diplomatic scene vis-\u00e0-vis Russia also could be better. Russia is undergoing a strategic resurgence of sorts, sustained in good measure by the close relations recently established with China. Buoyed by developments in the Ukraine and Crimea, and the uncertainties surrounding U.S. commitment to NATO, the new Russia-China 'strategic congruence' is certain to impact Asia. The problem for India and Indian diplomacy is that at this time India-Russia relations appear less robust than at any time in the past half century.\n\nIndia's 'Act East and Look West' policies have given a new dimension to Indian diplomacy in both East and West Asia. In both regions, however, but especially in West Asia, Indian diplomacy still lacks the nimbleness required to deal with fast-changing situations. In West Asia, despite its long time presence in the region, a 9-million strong diaspora, and the region being its principal source of oil, India is not a major player today. Both Russia and China have overtaken India in the affairs of the region. This is particularly true of Iran where the Russia-China-Iran relationship has greatly blossomed, almost marginalising India's influence.\n\nIndia's absence from, and its inability to play a role in, West Asia, even as the region confronts a split down the line between the Arab and the non-Arab world is unfortunate. More so, there is the possibility of a series of confrontations between an increasingly powerful Shiite Iran and a weakening Saudi Arabia. The most recent challenge is the one posed by Qatar to the existing order in the West Asian region. The fallout of all this will impact India adversely and Indian diplomacy's inability to make its presence felt will matter. An additional concern for India would be that growing uncertainties in the region could further fuel radical Islamist terror in the region.\n\nThe 'Act East' policy has produced better results. Closer relations with countries in East and South East Asia, especially Japan and Vietnam, are a positive development. However, in the Asia-Pacific, India has to contend with an increasingly assertive China. There is little evidence to show that India's diplomatic manoeuvres individually, or with allies like Japan, have succeeded in keeping the Chinese juggernaut at bay -- or for that matter provide an alternative to China in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIndia's diplomatic establishment is all too aware of the political history and economics of the Asian region. Under Prime Minister Modi, diplomatic styles have changed but it would seem that the substance has altered little. His recent visit to Israel was, no doubt, a resounding success, but Israel was already one of the very few countries which had shown a complete understanding of India's defence and security needs, even ignoring the sanctions imposed on India by some countries. Israel's supply of critical defence items during the Kargil conflict (of 1999) is an excellent example.\n\nWhat Indian diplomacy currently needs to do is to find a way to steer amid an assertive China, a hostile Pakistan, an uncertain South Asian and West Asian neighbourhood, and an unstable world. The strategic and security implications of these, individually and severally, need to be carefully validated and pursued. Indian diplomacy may possibly need to display still higher levels of sophistication to overcome the odds.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country",

India shares similar thoughts in this regard.\"\n\nOver these years China India trade has increased, the Consul General mentioned.\n\nWhen asked about the Kashmir issue, Zhanwu said, \"I must make it clear that it is an issue between India and Pakistan, to sort out their differences through negotiations. It is Chinese position over the years.\n\nChina claims Doklam plateau is not very far from the Sikkim sector. In June 2017, India had accused China of constructing a road in the disputed territory towards Doklam plateau, an objection that the Royal Bhutanese Army has also raised. India intervened in the crisis supporting Bhutan's stand and asking China to halt its construction work.\n\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) had support and participation by over 100 countries and international organizations since it was first proposed four years ago. The UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council have both adopted resolutions that contained content on BRI.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "18"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bhutan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "32"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Myanmar [Burma]"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myanmar [Burma]"}, "type": "loc", "id": "146"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Sikkim"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51861"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54980"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India\u2013Pakistan_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308344", "label": {"eng": "India\u2013Pakistan relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319855", "label": {"eng": "Consul (representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324231", "label": {"eng": "Kashmir conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "396750", "label": {"eng": "East India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bhutan_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "448717", "label": {"eng": "Royal Bhutan Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumbi_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1213818", "label": {"eng": "Chumbi Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Belt,_One_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1270774", "label": {"eng": "One Belt, One Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh\u2013China\u2013India\u2013Myanmar_Forum_for_Regional_Cooperation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1371806", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh\u2013China\u2013India\u2013Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation"}}]}

Let us first prepare for this eventuality and only then enter in brinkmanship\n\nIt is a matter of serious concern that senior members, representing our national security apparatus, have made some wayward statements in the recent past, which seems rather bizarre to say the least.\n\nWe have also seen the professional head of our Army talking about the present Indian stand-off with China in Doklam. He said that the Indian Army is fully prepared for a two-and-a-half front (China, Pakistan and internal security requirements simultaneously) war. What an astounding statement? But whom did the Army chief have in mind when he postulated this as a strategic dogma?\n\nThree weeks after his statement, People's Liberation Army (PLA) spokesman, Col Wu Qian, called the Army chief's statement \"extremely irresponsible\" and asked him to \"stop clamouring for war\", and learn from \"historical lessons\" -- an oblique reference to the 1962 war with China.\n\nWe got so peeved about the statement made by a comparatively lower rank officer that the Defence Minister entered the ring to take on Col Wu Qian. He did not let the Ministry of Defence spokesman respond.\n\nOne was also wonder struck when a very senior and sagacious leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) warned Pakistan against sponsoring terror and if not it should learn from \"historical lessons\" of 1971. In the prevailing geo-political and geo-strategic scenario, can we do a 1971 to Pakistan? 'Unimaginable' will be a short answer.\n\nComparative quotient of our combat potential vis-\u00e0-vis the adversaries is no secret. Before we talk of our capabilities to fight a two-and-a-half front war, could the powers that be tell the nation as to what has changed since the then Army chief, General VK Singh, wrote the famous letter to the then Prime Minister while demitting office nearly three and half years ago?\n\nThe letter stated, \"The state of the major (fighting) arms ie mechanised forces, artillery, air defence, infantry and special forces, as well as the engineers and signals, is indeed alarming.\"\n\nAbout the potential of our Air Force, Ashley J Tellis, a top American expert on defence matters, wrote that the Indian Air Force is vital for deterrence and stability in South Asia and for the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe Indian Air Force's fighter force is weaker than the numbers suggest. As many as 36.5 squadrons are short of its sanctioned strength and many of its frontline aircraft are obsolete. With this state of the Armed Forces, how can India play a pivotal role in the geo-strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific region? The state of our Navy too is depressing.\n\nI would like to share with my readers the operational concept and potential of the Chinese Army in Tibet. Beijing has raised the rank and status of its western Tibet military command to widen its scope for its missions and combat preparedness to fortify borders with India.\n\nA Beijing-based military expert, Song Shingling, has been quoted as saying that \"the Tibet military command bears great responsibility to prepare for possible conflicts between China and India, whose operational role is to initiate and sustain intense shock and awe by initiating blitzkrieg-type short campaigns against India\".\n\nNamrata Goswami, former research scholar of the Institute of Defence Studies, informs about the combat potential of our northern neighbour: \"China has been shooting for border dominance via military means and has built the required military infrastructure throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region.\n\nThe Middle Kingdom has built road and rail networks in Tibet, which provide ground mobility to 400,000 PLA soldiers in the two military regions opposite India. It has deployed upgraded ballistic missiles; added several new dual use airfields in Tibet; and expanded its military assets transport capability.\"\n\nA 2016 Pentagon report also states, \"We have noticed an increase in capability and force posture by the Chinese military in areas close to the border with India\", however it also said, \"it is difficult to say how much of this is driven by internal considerations to maintain internal stability, and how much of it is an external consideration.\"\n\nThe Defence department report also warns of China's increasing military presence, including bases in various parts of the world, in particular Pakistan, with which it has a \"long-standing friendly relationship and similar strategic interests\".\n\nWhat has India's strategic response been to these developments? We have raised a so-called strike Corps, which is still borne? On the diplomatic front, Prime Minister Narendra Modi supposedly has had a very good summit with US President Donald Trump. But did they talk about the US's response to the Chinese over land threat to India from Tibet? Unlikely. However, they defiantly would have talked about the South China Sea scenario.\n\nThe just concluded India-US-Japan Malabar military naval exercise in the Indian Ocean region has added much to the discomfiture of China and India. Can we look forward to a joint air exercise with participation of the member states of this tri-lateral alliance as 'whose time has come'? As per a very senior Chinese official, if India does eventually emerge as a US strategic partner, Beijing will exercise its options to neutralise.\n\nWhere do we go from here? The game is not about bunkers in Donglang, but developing road communications in the Chumbi valley. Can we stop them? Never!\n\nSo was the case in 1960, when the 'Chinese clearly under-estimated Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's adamancy in April 1960, when his back had been stiffened by his advisors'.\n\nI recently read a very lucid article on the present scenario but towards the end, the article came down to delivering a veiled threat to China that if the present impasse is not resolved, India has other options too. Pray, what? Are we prepared to go to war with China on Despiang? Despite what some of our senior diplomats have opined, the answer is a big No. Should we push the country into another debacle?\n\nWill China attack India? In 2009, the Indian Army conducted a war game, called the Divine Matrix, in the overall scenario that \"misadventure by China is very much within the realm of possibility.\"\n\nMilitary Operations Directorate had visualised a war scenario with the nuclear-armed neighbour before 2017. The assessment outlined that Beijing would employ information warfare (IW) to paralyse the command and control structure, both at the operational as well as at the strategic level. We must not be oblivious to a Divine Matrix scenario as we did to exercise Lal Qila in 1960.\n\n\"China is and will be a threat in being. On the north, we have China, which has a large landmass; huge resources; and a large-standing Army. Despite having the Himalayas between us, Beijing is bound to be a threat for us in the years ahead,\" said Vice Chief of the Army, Lieutenant General Sarath Chand.\n\nComing to Pakistan, we in our wildest dream cannot do 1971 to them. Terrorism is a part of their strategic triode (trishool), aimed at India, manifested by the Armed Forces, terrorists and nuclear forces. Lashkar-e-Tayyeba chief Hafeez Saeed was on record to have said that his aim is to dismember rather than destroy India. Remember the tape released from the hideout of Ayman al-Zawahiri, leader of Al Qaeda, having long-standing links with Hafiz Saeed?\n\nLet us not wish for a two-and-a-half front war. Let us first prepare for this eventuality and only then enter in brinkmanship. If supposedly the threshhold of tolerance is crossed by us, or by our adversaries, there may be more than two-and-a-half front, which we may have to contend with.\n\nEven in the hay days of 1971, the great chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, told the Prime Minister that he will take care of Pakistan and that it will have to take care of China. We and not Pakistan needs to learn from 1971.\n\nAt this juncture, the most potent threat is not the conventional conflict, but Kashmir imbroglio. The Army can fight insurgency and not a political uprising. Unfortunately the situation is drifting in that directing despite Jammu & Kashmir Governor NN Vohra and Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti being at the helm.\n\nOne wonders how the Armed Forces have been entrusted to resolve a complex and multi-dimensional crisis with no other stakeholders assuming responsibility.\n\nJawans of the Army and paramilitary are performing their duties under most stressful conditions. We send them out into the crowd and also instruct them not to use force! This contradiction gives rise to Pulwama-type incidents.\n\nBeing an old Kashmir hand, I fear that we may have a 'My Lai' type incident at our hand if India does not resolve its soldiers' operational and emotional contradictions.\n\nLet us devote our energies to save Kashmir by a responsive politico-military strategy. Let us strike an amenable posture with China and resolve the Despiang issue at priority and heed to what Kautilya had said, Chanakya Nitishastra.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

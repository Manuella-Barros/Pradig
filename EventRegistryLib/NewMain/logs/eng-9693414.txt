He has in some way given us all part of his life, and left us part of it.\"\n\nGorman's daughter Moya gave the first reading of the service while his widow Ceara, accompanied by her sisters, sang a song in tribute.\n\nHis son joe delivered a tribute on behalf of the family as the service drew toward conclusion.\n\nHe said his father was brilliant at finding a connection with people.\n\n\"I watched so many people meet Tommie for the first time and learn something new about their own lives right in front of me,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"He found real joy in connecting with people and connecting deeply. It's a great privilege that I don't have to tell anybody here how much he cared about you - he said it to you.\"\n\nHis son continued: \"One of the things I keep hearing about Tommie is that he always had time for people, he never made you feel as if he had somebody more important to see, because he didn't.\n\n\"When he was with you, he really was there in the moment listening to you and making you feel seen and heard. Those skills are the reason why people who met him just one time can remember him for a lifetime.\"\n\nConcluding the tribute, Gorman's son said: \"The last few days have been devastating for our family, for Tommie's friends and for everybody whose lives he touched. But grief is the price we pay for love, and we more than got our money's worth with Tommie Gorman.\"\n\nFollowing his death, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins described Gorman as \"a trusted source of information for the public during challenging years, the fostering of peace, and all that was achieved in Anglo-Irish relations over that time\".\n\nApart from his political journalism, the versatile reporter also famously interviewed Roy Keane after the footballer's row with manager Mick McCarthy at the Republic of Ireland team's Japan 2002 World Cup training camp on the island of Saipan.\n\nHe also tracked down poet Seamus Heaney on a Greek island after he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nFollowing the service, Gorman's remains were taken to Kilmacowen Cemetery, around a mile away, for burial.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommie_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommie Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bakhurst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bakhurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Robinson_(Northern_Ireland_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlene Foster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

He had endured a long battle with cancer, having first been diagnosed in 1994.\n\nHis widow Ceara and children Moya and Joe all participated in Saturday's service. The church was full to capacity, with many mourners congregating outside to listen on loudspeakers.\n\nAhead of the mass, players from Gorman's beloved Sligo Rovers accompanied his cortege to the church and formed a line outside as his coffin was carried inside.\n\nThere were multiple references to the reporter's passion for the team during the service that followed.\n\nIn a mass that was also marked with many touches of warmth and humour, parish priest and long-time friend Christopher McGrann joked that he would now be spared Gorman's \"never ending questions\".\n\n\"I won't see him at mass here on Sunday,\" he said.\n\n\"I won't be ringing at his doorbell, and he won't be ringing at mine. Above all, I won't be able to tell him to stop bothering me with his never-ending questions.\"\n\nGorman, a Sligo native, worked at RTE for more than 40 years.\n\nHe was RTE's Europe editor before moving to Belfast in 2001 and was its northern editor when he retired in 2021.\n\nLater in the homily, the priest spoke of Gorman's time in Northern Ireland and how he was driven by optimism and a desire to see people coming together.\n\n\"He was a very particular and unique force towards mediation and unity and always with a sense of great hope for a better future,\" he said.\n\n\"And this influence will come alive with the passing of time and history will be pleased with the part that Tommie Gorman played.\"\n\nFr McCrann said Gorman did not allow his illness to \"be his identity\".\n\nHe praised the journalist's \"decency, honour, diplomacy, truthfulness, humility and kindness\".\n\n\"We who remain thank you Tommie Gorman, because you have walked with great nobility among us,\" he said.\n\nFr McCrann said the local community in Sligo had lost a friend and \"very, very good neighbour\".\n\n\"As have so many people gathered here and many, many more who are not here,\" he added.\n\n\"But all of us have gained because we have had the opportunity of being in some way, big or small, in contact with Tommie. We have all gained a mentor whose life witness will continue to bear fruit in our lives. He has in some way given us all part of his life, and left us part of it.\"\n\nGorman's daughter Moya gave the first reading of the service while his widow Ceara, accompanied by her sisters, sang a song in tribute.\n\nHis son joe delivered a tribute on behalf of the family as the service drew toward conclusion.\n\nHe said his father was brilliant at finding a connection with people.\n\n\"I watched so many people meet Tommie for the first time and learn something new about their own lives right in front of me,\" he said.\n\nHe added: \"He found real joy in connecting with people and connecting deeply. It's a great privilege that I don't have to tell anybody here how much he cared about you - he said it to you.\"\n\nHis son continued: \"One of the things I keep hearing about Tommie is that he always had time for people, he never made you feel as if he had somebody more important to see, because he didn't.\n\n\"When he was with you, he really was there in the moment listening to you and making you feel seen and heard. Those skills are the reason why people who met him just one time can remember him for a lifetime.\"\n\nConcluding the tribute, Gorman's son said: \"The last few days have been devastating for our family, for Tommie's friends and for everybody whose lives he touched. But grief is the price we pay for love, and we more than got our money's worth with Tommie Gorman.\"\n\nFollowing his death, President of Ireland Michael D Higgins described Gorman as \"a trusted source of information for the public during challenging years, the fostering of peace, and all that was achieved in Anglo-Irish relations over that time\".\n\nApart from his political journalism, the versatile reporter also famously interviewed Roy Keane after the footballer's row with manager Mick McCarthy at the Republic of Ireland team's Japan 2002 World Cup training camp on the island of Saipan.\n\nHe also tracked down poet Seamus Heaney on a Greek island after he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nFollowing the service, Gorman's remains were taken to Kilmacowen Cemetery, around a mile away, for burial.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommie_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommie Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_and_deputy_First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bakhurst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bakhurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Robinson_(Northern_Ireland_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlene Foster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Northern_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Northern Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homily"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

There are not many eulogies that include such direct references to Roy Keane, the Reverand Ian Paisley and Gorman's beloved Sligo Rovers, but such was the breath of Tommie Gorman's canon that nobody was surprised to hear such names mentioned in the telling of his life's story.\n\nIt speaks volumes of the man that those namechecks were so easily overshadowed by the recalling of the late broadcaster's most admirable qualities; his curiosity, his kindness and his unconditional love for life.\n\nThis was a funeral that can only be described as a bittersweet celebration of a brilliant life. Gorman passed away on Tuesday at the age of 68.\n\nHe retired from RT\u00c9 in April 2021 after a career spanning 40 years. Colleagues past and present, as well as Taoiseach Simon Harris, former Sinn F\u00e9in and DUP leaders Gerry Adams and Arlene Foster, and First Minister Michelle O'Neill gathered to pay their respects to the well-loved broadcaster whose career included signature postings for the national broadcaster in Brussels as European Correspondent, and most memorably in Northern Ireland during the most pivotal period of the peace process.\n\nIt was telling that Foster and Peter Robinson attended alongside Adams and O'Neill, a totem of the trust Gorman enjoyed on both sides of the political divide.\n\nDespite many well-known faces in the congregation, it was Gorman's Sligo Rovers who provided the star turn. The local League of Ireland club - one of the great loves of Gorman's life - performed a guard of honour as he was carried into the church, and their red and white strip could be seen throughout the crowd. The funeral cortege, led by his wife Ceara, son Joe and daughter Moya, had earlier made a farewell stop at the Showgrounds, the home to Sligo Rovers.\n\nGorman had been a lifelong supporter, his son Joe describing how he skipped his final journalism exams to go watch the 'Bit O'Red' watch Red Star Belgrade in Europe. He didn't graduate because of his football-inspired truancy.\n\nTypically, he had no regrets. In more recent years, despite failing health, he was a prominent advocate for the club and one of the most active fundraisers for the redevelopment of the Show Grounds.\n\nIn a fitting tribute, Tommie's beloved Sligo Rovers pulled off a 2-0 victory over Shamrock Rovers at the Showgrounds last night - hours before he made his final trip.\n\n\"It's a great privilege that I don't have to tell anybody here what my father thought of them,\" said Gorman's son Joe, \"they already knew, because he told them.\"\n\nSpeaking on the way into the church, Gerry Adams spoke of Gorman's role in the peace process, describing how the Sligo man had helped build \"gentle\" bridges between both sides of the conflict.\n\n\"He got frustrated and of course, sometimes he drove many Republicans mad, but he just loved the way the process could move from conflict to killing to relative peace and he helped get both sides talking,\" Mr. Adams said.\n\nIn 1994 Gorman was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumours (Net), a rare form of cancer, with which he lived bravely and with little complaint.\n\nHis son Joe spoke candidly about the critical life decisions his dad and his mum faced upon his diagnosis, a young couple living in Brussels with a little baby on their hands. That Gorman's best work came in the subsequent thirty years was indicative of his can-do attitude, and his unwillingness to let an illness define him.\n\nChief Celebrant Reverand Christopher McCann told the congregation of his close relationship with Mr Gorman over the years, and how the late man always had \"never-ending\" questions for him - his journalistic qualities shining through far past the television screen.\n\n\"History will be pleased with the part that Tommie Gorman played,\" he said. Few in attendance would disagree.\n\nIn closing his eulogy, Joe Gorman went one better. Paying tribute to his father, he simply said: \"If grief is the price we pay for love, we got our money's worth with Tommie Gorman.\"\n\nThe rain held off. The skies stayed blue, and between a sea of red jerseys Gorman was carried down to Kilmacowen Cemetery for the last time, surrounded by those who loved him.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_sheridan@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Colin Sheridan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommie_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommie Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michelle O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlene_Foster", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arlene Foster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Paisley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Paisley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoiseach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taoiseach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerry Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Unionist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Unionist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_F\u00e9in", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sinn F\u00e9in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Harris_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simon Harris (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Robinson_(Northern_Ireland_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard of honour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Ireland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "League of Ireland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_Belgrade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Star Belgrade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shamrock Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8368/4184362_5_articlelarge_FUNERAL_20Gorman_20_2018111144A.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693414", "eventUri": "eng-9693414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

He had endured a long battle with cancer, having first been diagnosed in 1994. His widow Ceara and children Moya and Joe all participated in the service.\n\nPlayers from Mr Gorman's beloved Sligo Rovers accompanied his cortege to the church and formed a line outside as his coffin was carried inside. In a Mass marked with many touches of warmth and humour, parish priest and long-time friend Christopher McGrann joked that he would now be spared Mr Gorman's \"never ending questions\".\n\nThe cleric later spoke of Mr Gorman's time in Northern Ireland and how he was driven by optimism and a desire to see people coming together. He added: \"He was a very particular and unique force towards mediation and unity and always with a sense of great hope for a better future.\"\n\nFr McCrann also praised the journalist's \"decency, honour, diplomacy, truthfulness, humility and kindness\".\n\nJoe delivered a tribute on behalf of the family as the service drew toward conclusion. He said: \"One of the things I keep hearing about Tommie is that he always had time for people.\n\n\"He never made you feel as if he had somebody more important to see, because he didn't. When he was with you, he really was there in the moment listening to you and making you feel seen and heard.\n\n\"Those skills are the reason why people who met him just one time can remember him for a lifetime.\"\n\nAfter the service, Mr Gorman's remains were taken to Kilmacowen Cemetery, around a mile away, for burial.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

He had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer but he never let it become the focus of his life, although it did become the subject of a documentary.\n\nHe died last Tuesday aged 68 after an operation connected to this illness.\n\nThe journalist Mary Finnegan once said that if you knew Mike Burns, Tommie Gorman and Garech Browne you could get a phone number for almost anybody in the world with an interest in Ireland, as they were all so well connected in different spheres of influence.\n\nAlthough he had no academic \u00adqualifications Gorman absorbed and learned from everybody he met and had an uncanny ability to make connections. When I met him for the first time he recalled immediately that my uncle Tommy Farrell from \u00adMullingar had once given him a lift when he was \"thumbing\" home to Sligo as a student.\n\nFrom his mentor John Healy, \u00adauthor of The Death of an Irish Town, to RT\u00c9 producer John Blackman \"who taught me images and sounds are the spine of a television story\" to his own philosophy of \"telling myself I was about to have a brief chat with my neighbours and it was vital to talk in terms they understood\", Gorman became a trusted figure in Irish life, interviewing a myriad of politicians and others from poet Seamus Heaney to businessman Se\u00e1n Quinn.\n\nAlong the way he brought his own style to memorable occasions. \"Keen to not look tired or ill, I always sought to dress sharply, in a formal rather than casual way,\" he said in his autobiography.\n\nFormer taoiseach Bertie Ahern recalled in the Irish Independent \u00adGorman's role in Irish journalism. \"The best example of Tommie being a solutions-driven reporter that I can give was Saipan. He tried to be a mediator between Roy Keane and Mick McCarthy and he put me, as taoiseach, on standby. I remember he was working in overdrive for days.\"\n\nTommie Gorman, the son of cattle dealer Joe Gorman and his wife Maureen, was born in Cairns Road, Sligo on April 3, 1956. He attended Scoil Fatima and St John's national school before going to Summerhill College in September 1969.\n\nHe was an avid and lifelong \u00adSligo Rovers fan and among his many memorable trips was one to Glasgow to play in a tournament organised by Celtic assistant-manager Sean Fallon, who was from Sligo.\n\nHe got a place in the journalism course at Rathmines College, but left following a failed romance with another Sligo student, Mary Kerrigan, and an offer to join John Healy and Jim Maguire as the Sligo correspondent of the fledgling Western Journal.\n\nWhen Sligo Rovers qualified to play Red Star Belgrade in the European Cup, Gorman missed an opportunity to sit his postponed final exams to travel instead to Yugoslavia to report on the match. At the age of 23 he was appointed editor of the Western Journal based in Ballina, Co Mayo.\n\nIn 1980 Mike Burns gave him the job of north-west correspondent of RT\u00c9. His brief included covering events in Derry. \"I was utterly unprepared for the full-on, vivid tableau of mayhem I encountered a two-hour journey up the road,\" he wrote of his first riot. But it whetted his appetite for the place and its people.\n\nIn 1989 Gorman moved to Brussels as Europe editor, where he covered the EEC as it then was and Ireland's new Commissioner and Sligo man, Ray MacSharry, as well as various summits and stories like the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nHis producers in RT\u00c9 included Kevin Bakhurst, who became a close friend and among his colleagues in the Brussels press pack was a 24-year-old Boris Johnson. \"The glint in his eye and his half smile gave Boris a likeability factor,\" Gorman wrote. \"He rarely gave the impression of being 100pc serious. But, as a communicator, he had a special gift for crafting headline stories that were almost true.\"\n\nIn 1993, at the age of 37 and based in Belgium, he was hospitalised with an appendix problem. There he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, small tumours that grow slowly and had spread to his liver. \"I wasn't frightened by the idea of having cancer or ashamed of it,\" he wrote.\n\nIt offered a ringside seat to observe and report on the peace process\n\n\"I didn't feel that I was terminally ill. The low moment came when Ceara [his wife] swept into the ward with our nine-month-old daughter Moya, keen to hear how the appendix problem had been tackled. That exchange, sharing unexpected news, was the only time that I struggled to keep things together.\"\n\nHis illness and lengthy treatment in Sweden became the subject of the RT\u00c9 documentary Ireland, Cancer and Me, which he said later \"drew me into a public spat with some of \u00ad[Ireland's] most accomplished consultants\".\n\nIn 2002 Gorman secured the first interview with Roy Keane in Manchester after the bust-up in Saipan through a long-time contact, Michael Kennedy, Keane's adviser. The tournament was still in progress but his efforts to woo Keane back to the Irish squad were unsuccessful.\n\nHis family relocated to Sligo in 1997, with him commuting to Brussels until 2001, when he took over as Northern editor at RT\u00c9.\n\n\"The main work-related attraction of switching from Brussels to Belfast was that it offered a ringside seat to observe and report on the peace process.\" It was one that he relished, becoming a familiar figure to political leaders of all persuasions.\n\nGorman retired in April 2021 and returned to live in Lisheen, close to the sea and under the shadow of Knocknarea mountain where he wrote his memoirs.\n\nAt a reception to launch his memoir in the Irish embassy in London, Ambassador Martin Fraser said: \"Like all good people, you don't have to agree with everything Tommie says, and Tommie doesn't have to agree with everything we think or say or do but we all trust Tommie and we all respect Tommie and we all love Tommie.\"\n\nHe was honoured to be asked to give the 2023 oration at B\u00e9al na Bl\u00e1th in Cork, commemorating the ambush where Michael Collins was killed.\n\n\"In my working life I've seen the ballot box replace the Armalite, the resilience of democracy, the power of generosity and the liberating force of forgiveness,\" he wrote in the last paragraph of his book. \"With the sense that these are bonus years the first thought I have on waking, most mornings, is 'Never Better'.\"\n\nTommie Gorman, who died on June 25 in St Vincent's Hospital Dublin, was buried in Sligo yesterday. He is survived by his wife Ceara Roche and their children Moya and Joe and a wide circle of friends and relations.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish

Also among the thousands queuing were former European MEP Pat \"The Cope\" Gallagher and Fine Gael TD Charlie Flanagan.\n\nBusinessman Denis O'Brien flew in from Belgium to pay his respects.\n\nBefore the funeral mass began, representatives of Sligo Rovers walked with the coffin in a guard of honour for what was described as their \"12th man\".\n\nIn a deeply personal and moving eulogy, Chief Celebrant Fr Christopher McCrann, who was a close friend of Tommie's, extended a special word to his wife Ceara, his daughter Moya and his son Joe as well as his brother Michael and his sister Mary.\n\n\"Know that our hearts go out to you,\" he said.\n\nFr McCrann said when he heard the news his \"heart sank, and it was shocking\".\n\n\"So many people felt that same sadness and it took so long to sink in.\n\n\"Tommie loved people and he treated each one with a care and a kindness that was like the Sacrament of friendship.\n\n\"Our community has lost a friend and a very good neighbour.\n\n\"We all had a mentor whose life witness will continue to bear fruit in our lives, and he has given us all part of his life and left us part of it.\"\n\nFr McCrann added that where you invest your love, you invest your life.\n\n\"Tommie invested a big part of his life in our community,\" he said.\n\n\"Tommie was a journalist and a very good one and again we see a gift.\n\n\"He was a very particular and unique force towards mediation and unity and always with a sense of great hope for a better future.\n\n\"And this influence will come alive with the passing of time and history will be pleased with the part that Tommie Gorman played.\n\n\"And Tommie suffered a lot with illness, but he never allowed it to be his identity.\n\n\"His faith he embraced and supported cancer patients all over Ireland and further afield.\n\n\"There are many people we know who are very grateful for his personal closeness to them.\"\n\nFr McCrann added that Tommie had great faith and was never afraid to show it.\n\n\"He loved Knocknahur and he loved all things Sligo, his home place of Cairns Road and his own Sligo Rovers and Sligo rightly honoured him as a Freeman of the City.\n\n\"But Tommie never had sheep,\" he quipped.\n\n\"Tommie was a great talker but also a quiet and discreet man.\n\n\"In the words of Yeats, it is long since we began to call up to the mind this wise and simple man.\n\n\"And so, we all say Tommie, may God to whom you entrusted so much of your life, let you both now recognise each other as you meet face to face.\n\n\"And as your God embraces you and sees you in your decency, your honour, your diplomacy, your truthfulness, your humility, your kindness and kiss you as only God can kiss a truly beloved son with love and tears of joy in your eyes and be forever at peace.\n\n\"And we who remain thank you Tommie Gorman because you have walked with great nobility among us.\"\n\nHis eulogy was warmly applauded\n\nAt the end of the Mass Tommie's wife Ceara and her sisters sang an emotive beautiful song and his son Joe's eulogy was greeted with huge applause.\n\nTommie Gorman is survived by his wife, Ceara, daughter Moya, son Joe, brother Michael and sister Mary.\n\nHe was predeceased by his parents Joe and Maureen and by his sister Paula.\n\nAfter Mass, he was interred in Kilmacowen Cemetery.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommie_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommie Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knocknarea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knocknarea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T\u00e1naiste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T\u00e1naiste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

He took funeral attendance \"to a level of high art. I can imagine him coming home from this and saying jeez, it was great, full to the rafters. Kieran and Sin\u00e9ad were incredible on the music. Fr Christy was on fire.\"\n\nJoe O'Gorman was speaking about his father at Gorman's funeral Mass in Our Lady Star of the Sea Church, at Ransboro, Co Sligo on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Tommie loved funerals because his lifeblood was connection. There was nobody he couldn't connect with, even if they were a Shamrock Rovers fan.\" His father \"loved people, and he told his friend Martin McGuinness that generosity was the greatest weapon.\"\n\nHe would say \"that the most admired presidents and prime ministers are just people like the rest of us at the end of the day. But he would also say the same about people that were despised. He would find your humanity, even if you tried to hide it from him, and he would love you for that.\"\n\nGorman's \"respect for politicians as people that just wanted to do good\" was, Joe thought, cemented by an experience in 1994 when his father was first diagnosed with cancer and Padraig Flynn [then European commissioner for social affairs] told Tommie to \"get the best treatment he could, and that he could pay for anything as long as he had the money\". His father did not need to call on that offer, even if he could.\n\nHis father \"loved Sligo to its roots, and \"used to get giddy crossing the Curlews\". He \"always referenced that Springsteen song - you only have one hometown\".\n\nHis great phrase was \"what is life, but love and sport? And in sport, as in love, the imperfections are the most beautiful thing of all. He wrote that Rovers are the perfect fit for Sligo because of the flaws. We are never the finished article.\"\n\nGorman believed, \"not just in some religious sense\", and he \"loved people who believed\", people like journalists John Healy, Tom Lyons, and Ian Kehoe who set up their own publications. Or \"his friend John O'Mahony\" the football manager who brought in Tommie as video analyst 30 years before. Or Ed Mulhall, \"the best boss he ever had\".\n\nOnce a friend, who was having a great time, announced that \"when I die, I'm coming back as meself.\" Joe O'Gorman added \"I think we'd all agree that Tommie would do the same.\"\n\nMass celebrant Fr Christopher McCrann spoke of how so many people over recent days were in shock at news of Gorman's death, \"some really devastated.\" For himself, \"my heart sank.\"\n\nIt also meant that \"I won't be able to tell him to stop bothering me with his never-ending questions\" and then \"more questions until the point of wearing you down. You know, at times, Tommie could be a real pain in the butt.\"\n\nQuoting a friend of his own Fr McCrann said that one of Gorman's qualities was \"the sacrament of friendship.\" Each person \"was special and unique to him and he managed, like St Paul, to 'become all things to all people'. \"\n\nAs a journalist he had \"a very particular and unique force towards mediation and unity and always with a sense of great hope for a better future\". He also \"suffered, as we know, but he did not allow it to be his identity\".\n\nOne of Gorman's striking features was that \"he was a man of faith and he proclaimed it with his life and talked about it freely.\" As a parishioner \"he was a living witness to that faith and a true believer in eternal life.\"\n\nAnd while he was \"without doubt, a great talker,\" he was also \"a quite and discreet man. In the words of our home-grown Yeats: 'It's long since we began/To call up to mind/This wise and simple man.'\"\n\nFr McCrann concluded \"we who remain thank you Tommie Gorman because you have walked with great nobility among us\".\n\nAs the Mass ended, Gorman's wife Ceara and her sisters sang (Talk to Me Of) Mendocino, by Kate and Anna McGarrigle).\n\nChief mourners were Ceara and their children Moya and Joe, as well as his sister Mary and brother Michael.\n\nThe large attendance included Capt Paul O'Donnell, representing President Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Simon Harris, Mayor of Sligo Declan Bree, Northern Ireland's First Minister Michelle O'Neill, Minister Dara Calleary, Frank Feighan TD, Martin Kenny TD, former T\u00e1naiste Dick Spring, former Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan.\n\nThere too were Arlene Foster and Peter Robinson of the DUP, Alasdair McDonnell and Dr Joe Hendron of the SDLP, former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams. RT\u00c9 Director General Kevin Bakhurst, as well as RT\u00c9 colleagues Cahal Goan, Ed Mulhall, Julian Vignoles, Anne Cassin, Bryan Dobson, Carole Coleman, Mary Wilson, Vincent Kearney, Joe Little, Se\u00e1n O'Rourke, Ray Burke.\n\nOther journalists present included Mark Hennessy, Marese McDonagh and Gerry Moriarty of The Irish Times, John Downing of the Irish Indepepdent and Tom Lyons and Ian

There was no body he couldn't connect with even if they were a Shamrock Rovers fan.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I loved showing him off to my friends and letting him do his thing which he did better than anybody - which was finding a connection.\n\n\"I watched so many people meet Tommie the first time and learn something new about their own lives right in front of me.\n\n\"He really loved people. And he told his friend Martin McGuinness that generosity was the greatest weapon.\"\n\nMourners heard how Tommie proposed to his wife in a posted letter.\n\nJoe said: \"They were the very definition of opposites attract, but they minded each other.\n\n\"It was so beautiful to see their love blossom even more after he retired.\"\n\nHis son recalled Tommie's saying \"love is all that matters\".\n\n'Find your humanity'\n\nJoe said: \"He'd say that the most admired presidents and prime ministers are just people like the rest of us at the end of the day.\n\n\"But he'd also say the same about people that were despised. He'd find your humanity, even if you tried to hide it from him, and he'd love you for it.\n\n\"That integrity was much more important to him than any achievement or if you were a VIP.\"\n\nRemembered for his love of his Sligo roots, his son Joe recalled fond memories.\n\nLove of Sligo Rovers\n\nJoe said: \"When rovers were in the lead, he'd actually leave the house to walk the roads in Ransboro and say rosary after rosary, counting the seconds down.\n\n\"I would text him and say 'we're one nil up'. He would reply and say 'I'm on the Lough Derg shift'.\"\n\nJoe continued: \"The last few days have been devastating for our family, Tommie's friends, and for everybody whose lives he touched.\n\n\"But grief is the price we pay for love. And we more than got our money's worth with Tommie Gorman.\"\n\nShock at death\n\nFr Christopher McCrann, and friend to Tommie, told how he and the community were left in shock of Tommie's passing.\n\nHe said: \"He was ill for a long time, as we know. He suffered a lot, but he never, and he did not allow it to be his identity.\n\n\"Instead, he embraced and endorsed the ongoing support for cancer patients here in Ireland and further afield.\n\n\"There are many people we know who are extremely grateful for his personal closeness to them.\"\n\nHis wife Ceara, along with her sisters, sang Talk to Me Of Mendocino.\n\nFr McCrann added: \"Thank you, Tommie Gorman, because you have walked with great nobility and dignity among us.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_russell_masterson@thesun.ie", "name": "Danielle Russell Masterson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommie_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tommie Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bakhurst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Bakhurst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shamrock Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McGuinness", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin McGuinness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo_Rovers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sligo Rovers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lough_Derg_(Shannon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lough Derg (Shannon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sligo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sligo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000913512524.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693414", "eventUri": "eng-9693414", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

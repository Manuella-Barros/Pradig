The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the \u201clevel of social division and damage to our community has caused us to rethink the level of transparency needed\u201d. Conroy has accused the Greens of spreading misinformation about arms exports and sought to reassure Australians alarmed by the increasing number of Palestinians killed in Gaza. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u201cWe care and we\u2019ve been horrified by events,\u201d Conroy said. \u201cI do want to assure people who are really concerned and horrified about what is going on in Gaza that the Australian government is horrified by the loss of lives and we\u2019ve repeatedly called for a ceasefire and repeatedly called for a two-state solution.\u201d The government has previously been criticised for a lack of transparency about exactly what Israel-bound export permits have been approved. The Greens have campaigned for Labor to \u201cstop military exports to Israel\u201d. At a Senate estimates hearing last week, officials gave their most detailed account yet of the eight specific permits issued since the Hamas attacks on 7 October sparked Israel\u2019s devastating assault on Gaza. Officials said seven permits allowed Australian defence or law enforcement equipment to be sent to Israel for repairs before returning to Australia. The eighth permit was for \u201ca nonlethal item\u201d to return to Israel. Conroy said on Sunday it was \u201cclear that we need to be more transparent with how the export permit system is working\u201d. \u201cThe Greens exploited what is a reasonably opaque system to get claims out there that are wrong, and that has required the government \u2013 working with Defence \u2013 to be more transparent while protecting commercial-in-confidence information,\u201d the minister said. The Greens\u2019 defence spokesperson, David Shoebridge, said there were \u201cstaggering revelations in Senate estimates about the scale of Australia\u2019s two-way arms trade with Israel\u201d. Shoebridge said officials had also revealed that 66 defence-related export permits remained active for Israel. \u201cDefence has still not told the public what is in these permits,\u201d he said. The government has said it is \u201cscrutinising pre-existing export permits to Israel\u201d. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, told a pro-Palestine rally in Melbourne on Sunday that the government should \u201cstop making F-35 fighter parts for planes that get used in Israel and rule out all two-way military trade\u201d. Bandt also called on the government to \u201ccancel the $900m contract that Elbit Systems has for Australian weapons\u201d \u2013 a reference to South Korean company Hanwha\u2019s arrangement with Israeli subcontractor Elbit to produce some systems that will be fitted to the Australian army\u2019s own infantry fighting vehicles. Bandt told those participating in weekly pro-Palestine marches that there was \u201cno place for violence in our politics, against people, politicians, their staff or their offices, and everyone has the right to feel safe\u201d. \u201cI know that is not what you\u2019re about, but I\u2019m just making this clear for the Labor and Liberal politicians and those in the media who are now attacking your peaceful protests and deliberately trying to discredit you and stop you from speaking out,\u201d Bandt said. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, united in parliament last Wednesday to strongly condemn the Greens for allegedly inflaming tensions at protests outside some federal politicians\u2019 electorate offices. On Sunday, Conroy sought to reach out to anyone who may have interpreted that as a sign the government was not hearing community pleas for action to protect civilians in Gaza. Conroy said Australia had called for a ceasefire for the past six months and \u201cfor Israel to respect international law\u201d, while also urging the release of hostages held by Hamas. \u201cUnfortunately, some of those messages get drowned out, but for Adam Bandt to claim we are complicit in genocide is as inaccurate as it is offensive.\u201d Australia and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding on \u201cdefence industry cooperation\u201d in 2017 but Conroy said it had \u201cnot come across my desk\u201d in the two years he had been defence industry minister. He defended Australia\u2019s role in the supply chain for F-35 fighter aircraft, saying it was a longstanding 18-nation consortium and \u201cultimately the use of military equipment is the responsibility of the defence force involved\u201d.", "summary": "<p>Defence industry minister says \u2018social division and damage\u2019 led government to rethink position on releasing information</p><ul><li>Get our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=cvau_sfl\">morning and afternoon news emails</a>, <a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/w4u7jx3\">free app</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/full-story?CMP=cvau_sfl\">daily news podcast</a></li></ul><p>The Albanese government has conceded it was forced to release more details about defence exports to Israel by a growing awareness that an information vacuum was being \u201cexploited\u201d and allowing misinformation to spread.</p><p>The defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, said the \u201clevel of social division and damage to our community has caused us to rethink the level of transparency needed\u201d.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p> <", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/10/more-transparency-needed-on-exports-to-israel-after-greens-exploited-system-labor-says", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5577ff287aaf047c4f720fa6ae832a5cecb30180/0_91_4185_2512/master/4185.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVm", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:00:21", "author": "Daniel Hurst", "authors": ["Daniel Hurst"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.317}

{"id": 239758282, "title": "Weather update: IMD predicts relief from heatwave, rain likely in many parts of north India from...", "text": "The latest weather updates across India paint a picture of contrasting conditions. While some areas are battling intense heatwaves, others are grappling with heavy rainfall and its consequences. In South Uttar Pradesh, isolated pockets continue to experience heatwave conditions, although relief is on the horizon. Meanwhile, the western coast is under a red alert due to heavy rainfall, with Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Goa expected to bear the brunt over the next few days. The monsoon's advance across India looks promising, according to the IMD, raising hopes for much-needed relief from scorching temperatures, particularly in Delhi and other northwestern regions. However, heavy rainfall has triggered concerns in Kerala, where the National Disaster Response Force has been deployed following incidents of flooding and accidents. In Maharashtra, the impact of rainfall is evident with a bridge submerged in Palghar and incidents of tree falls in Thane causing injuries. Kerala has already witnessed an early onset of rain, leading to unfortunate fatalities over the past month. The IMD has issued red alerts for several regions, including coastal and south interior Karnataka, Kerala, Mahe, Konkan, and Goa, while an orange alert is in place for Maharashtra, Andaman and Nicobar islands, as well as sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim. Additionally, parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, and Jharkhand are expected to experience rainfall. Accompanying the rainfall are strong gusts of wind from the Bay of Bengal, impacting West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar, according to IMD forecasts. The intense heatwave in Northwest India is gradually receding, though pockets of Uttar Pradesh still record high temperatures. Relief is expected between June 23-25. Despite recent thunderstorms and winds, temperatures in Delhi hover around 40.4 degrees celsius. Concerns arise as 75 bodies are awaiting autopsy in Noida, with investigations ongoing to determine if they are heatwave-related deaths. Union Minister JP Nadda reported 114 heatwave deaths and over 41,984 heatstroke cases across the country, underscoring the severity of the situation.", "summary": "Accompanying the rainfall are strong gusts of wind from the Bay of Bengal, impacting West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, and Bihar, according to IMD forecasts.", "url": "https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-weather-update-imd-predicts-relief-from-heatwave-rain-likely-in-many-parts-of-north-india-from-3094383", "image": "https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/half/public/2024/06/23/2638760-artifiical-rain-696x522.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:13:46", "author": "Shweta Singh", "authors": ["Shweta Singh"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.299}

{"id": 223679740, "title": "Tories promise to bring back National Service if they win General Election", "text": "Introduced in 1947 to resolved military manpower services after the Second World War it resulted in two million men being called up to join the British armed services.. But to many the experience of National Service was one of mindless drill and being shouted art by sergeants under pressure to knock conscripts into shape. Some hated it, others saw it as character building camaraderie. Accommodation was often stark, cold barracks with primitive toilets and poor washing facilities. Only the lucky had newly built brick barracks with central heating. Some were deployed to war zones in Suez, Malaysia, and Korea. Between 1947 and 1963 when it was ended a total of 395 National Servicemen were killed on active service. Now the Tories are proposing to bring back mandatory national service. But Home Secretary, James Cleverly said teenagers who defied it would not be sent to jail. Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, said that under the plan every 18-year-old would have to spend 12 months in the military full time or spend one weekend a month volunteering in \u201ccivil resilience\u201d. The Prime Minister said the policy would help unite society in an \u201cincreasingly uncertain world\u201d and give young people a \u201cshared sense of purpose\u201d. In an apparent pitch to older voters and those who may turn to Reform UK, the Conservatives said volunteering could include helping local fire, police and NHS services, as well as charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly people. Mr Cleverly said the Tories would ensure the scheme \u201cfits with different people\u2019s attitudes and aspirations\u201d after questions arose over whether teenagers would be punished for not taking part. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be no criminal sanction. There\u2019s no one going to jail over this,\u201d he told Sky News\u2019s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme. \u201cThis is about dealing with what we know to be the case, which is social fragmentation. Too many young people live in a bubble within their own communities. They don\u2019t mix with people of different religions, they don\u2019t mix with different viewpoints.\u201d Opposition critics have dismissed the plans as unserious, with Labour saying the pledge would never come to fruition and amounted to \u201canother unfunded commitment\u201d. The Prime Minister is seeking to draw a dividing line with Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party on global security following his pledge to raise defence spending to 2.5% of gross domestic product by 2030. Heightening his attack on Saturday, Mr Sunak said voters would be left \u201cat risk\u201d with the Labour leader in Number 10 because Britain\u2019s enemies would notice that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a plan\u201d. Teenagers who choose to sign up for a placement in the forces would \u201clearn and take part in logistics, cyber security, procurement or civil response operations\u201d, the Tories said. The Conservatives said they would establish a royal commission bringing in expertise from across the military and civil society to establish the details of what they described as the \u201cbold\u201d national service programme. The party said this commission would be tasked with bringing forward a proposal for how to ensure the first pilot is open for applications in September 2025. After that, it would seek to introduce a new \u201cNational Service Act\u201d to make the measures compulsory by the end of the next Parliament, the party said. It estimates the programme will cost \u00a32.5 billion a year by the end of the decade and plans to fund \u00a31 billion through plans to \u201ccrack down on tax avoidance and evasion\u201d. The remaining \u00a31.5 billion will be paid for with money previously used for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), a key part of the Levelling Up agenda which supports local charities and community groups, the Tories said. The Prime Minister said: \u201cThis is a great country but generations of young people have not had the opportunities or experience they deserve and there are forces trying to divide our society in this increasingly uncertain world. \u201cI have a clear plan to address this and secure our future. I will bring in a new model of national service to create a shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country. \u201cThis new, mandatory national service will provide life-changing opportunities for our young people, offering them the chance to learn real world skills, do new things and contribute to their community and our country.\u201d Earlier on Saturday, the PM suggested a government led by Sir Keir would be marked by uncertainty and a \u201cmore dangerous world.\u201d \u201cThe consequences of uncertainty are clear. No plan means a more dangerous world. You, your family and our country are all at risk if Labour win,\u201d he said. Sir Keir\u2019s party pointed out that Lord David Cameron introduced a similar scheme \u2013 the National Citizen Service \u2013 when he was prime minister. Lord Cameron\u2019s announcement had no military component to it, instead encouraging youngsters to take part in activities such as outdoor education-style courses as part of his \u201cBig Society\u201d initiative. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThis is not a plan \u2013 it\u2019s a review which could cost billions and is only needed because the Tories hollowed out the armed forces to their smallest size since Napoleon. \u201cBritain has had enough of the Conservatives, who are bankrupt of ideas, and have no plans to end 14 years of chaos. It\u2019s time to turn the page and rebuild Britain with Labour.\u201d Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson Richard Foord MP said: \u201cIf the Conservatives were serious about defence, they would reverse their damaging cuts to our world class professional armed forces, instead of decimating them, with swingeing cuts to the number of our regular service personnel. \u201cOur armed forces were once the envy of the world. This Conservative government has cut troop numbers and is planning more cuts to the size of the Army. This would be far better spent reversing Conservative cuts to troop numbers.\u201d Mr Sunak\u2019s pledge marks the first major policy announcement from either side ahead of the July 4 General Election that he called in a rain-soaked statement outside Downing Street earlier this week.", "summary": "Teenagers who defy it will not be jailed", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tories-promise-bring-back-national-29241725", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29242029.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_General-Election-campaign-2024.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:34:39", "author": "Neal Keeling,Nina Lloyd", "authors": ["Neal Keeling", "Nina Lloyd"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.231}

The team celebrated their championship at the White House on Friday.\n\nDespite being in the off-season, the team has made plenty of headlines, some fueled by the romance between tight end Travis Kelce and pop star Taylor Swift, and others, less rosy.\n\nChiefs placekicker Harrison Butker was the target of sharp criticism following his controversial commencement address at Catholic liberal arts school, Benedictine College, last month where he said that women were \"most excited\" about marriage and bearing children over personal careers.\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice turned himself in to police in April in connection with a multicar crash in Dallas in March.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glendale, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240606-bj-thompson-al-1306-1f87e3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630759", "eventUri": "eng-9630759", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported on a player suffering a seizure at the Chiefs' facility, which led to cardiac arrest.\n\nAccording to the initial post from Pelissero, \"The Chiefs canceled all team activities today after a backup defensive lineman had a seizure in a special teams meeting and went into cardiac arrest, per sources. The team's medical staff worked quickly, an ambulance was called and the player is currently in stable condition.\"\n\nThe report indicates that during a special teams meeting, a player suffered a seizure and went into cardiac arrest. Thankfully, medical personnel were quick on the scene and the player is in stable condition.\n\nPelissero also added more details about the player, revealing, \"Chiefs DL BJ Thompson is in stable condition after suffering a seizure and going into cardiac arrest during a meeting this morning, per source. A fifth-round pick in 2023 out of Stephen F. Austin, Thompson appeared in one game as a rookie for the Super Bowl champs.\"\n\nThe NFL, like many organizations, takes instances like this very seriously. Player safety is at the forefront of the league's minds at all times, and that is even more true since Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went down on the field in January 2023.\n\nHamlin had made a tackle on Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins and immediately collapsed. Paramedics instantly took the field, and it was later revealed that Hamlin had suffered cardiac arrest. However, with the medical staff quick to respond to the situation, he was stabilized and sent to the hospital.\n\nIt sounds like the situation at the Chiefs team activities was similar in nature, and Thompson has been attended to with great care and swiftness. The hope now is that this situation was an isolated incident, and the young defensive lineman is going to fully recover.\n\nThe Chiefs could also cancel team activities for the rest of the week to allow the situation to calm down. Seeing any player go down might be traumatic for those who were close to the situation, and just in general.\n\nMore details will likely come out the rest of the day and the week, but for now, Thompson is in stable condition. That is the best anyone could have hoped for in a scary situation like this.\n\nThe Chiefs should provide more updates as the situation continues to unfold.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damar_Hamlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damar Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_F._Austin_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen F.

However, the Chiefs were hit with a concerning medical emergency that caused Thursday's practice to be canceled. Kansas City canceled all team activities after backup defensive lineman BJ Thompson had a seizure and went into cardiac arrest, per Tom Pelissero.\n\nThankfully, Kansas City's medical staff worked quickly and an ambulance was called. Thompson remains in stable condition. Hopefully, he undergoes a speedy recovery from the shocking emergency.\n\nBJ Thompson is a fifth-round pick 2023 draft pick out of Stephen F. Austin. He appeared in one game as a rookie for Kansas City.\n\nThe Chiefs were not long removed from their visit to the White House for their Super Bowl 58 victory before Thompson's health scare. Returning to practice to witness a medical emergency is tough, but the team looks to stay strong and support their teammate amid his treatment and recovery.\n\nKansas City's practice incident is reminiscent of former basketball guard Bronny James' experience during the summer of 2023. James went into cardiac arrest during a Trojan basketball practice. Yet, he made a full recovery and was able to contribute to the team during his freshman season.\n\nFast forward nearly a year later and James is considered a respectable prospect for the 2024 NBA Draft. The 19-year-old standout performed well in Draft Combine drills and scrimmages. As a result, he climbed draft boards and has a good chance to start his professional tenure in the near future.\n\nJames' story is a positive sign for BJ Thompson. The former USC guard's bounceback should provide comfort and inspiration to Chiefs DL. Thompson and the team look to recover well and have things to look forward to.\n\nChiefs want to push forward after strong 2023-24 season\n\nKansas City finished the 2023-24 season with an 11-6 record, which placed them earned them an AFC Wild Card spot in the playoffs. The Chiefs battled through the Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, and Baltimore Ravens to advance to Super Bowl 58.\n\nKC continued their momentum and beat the 49ers 25-23 for their third championship in five years. The win marked the team as one of the most notable dynasties in NFL history. Of course, one of the biggest contributors to the Chiefs' success has been Patrick Mahomes.\n\nMahomes had a stout regular season. He threw for 4,183 yards, 27 TDs, and was clutch in the postseason. Furthermore, Mahomes made a big statement during Kansas City's championship parade in February. He confidently reassured fans that the team's Super Bowl three-peat was underway.\n\n\"We appreciate everything ya'll do...we know we had to go on the road last year, but I promise you next year we'll be at home. We're going for that three-peat so don't get it twisted. We're doing it. Three times, the first time in NFL history.

He played in one game as a rookie, registering two tackles for the defending Super Bowl champions.\n\nRelated Super Bowl 58 Hero Re-Signs With Chiefs On 1-Year Pact Hardman had quite the full circle year in 2023, leaving the Chiefs to sign a free-agent deal, only to win a ring after being traded back to them. Thompson's Situation Not A Replica of Damar Hamlin The Bills' safety went into cardiac arrest after attempting to make a tackle\n\nThe first thing NFL fans will think after hearing \"cardiac arrest\" is Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin.\n\nOn January 2, 2023, the Cincinnati Bengals and Buffalo Bills had their Monday Night Football game unprecedentedly canceled following a chest injury suffered by safety Damar Hamlin. The whole football world paused as the young defensive back lay unconscious on the field for what felt like hours.\n\nHamlin's injury was a direct result of the hit he took while tackling Tee Higgins, as opposed to whatever underlying issues caused Thompson's cardiac arrest and seizure.\n\nThe good news for Thompson is that Hamlin was playing in the NFL again last season, less than a year after his cardiac arrest. Of course, there may be issues that preclude Thompson from making such an immaculate recovery, but the fact that he's in stable condition so soon after the scare is a good sign.\n\nOf course, Thompson's health comes first. Whatever his NFL future holds, he will have to wait until he's medically cleared to resume on-field activities, and he'll need to determine his mental resolution regarding his desire to continue playing football.\n\nSource: Tom Pelissero\n\nRelated 'Play of the Day' Made by Damar Hamlin At Bills OTA Practice Only a year and a half after a near-fatal heart attack, Hamlin is impressing at training camp.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cardiac arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damar_Hamlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damar Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_F._Austin_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen F.

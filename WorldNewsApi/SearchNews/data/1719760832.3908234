[+] American Eagle store in Hong Kong. (Photo by Sebastian Ng/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO), which sells men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel and accessories under the American Eagle, Tailgate, Todd Snyder, and Aerie brands, is scheduled to report its fiscal first-quarter results on Wednesday, May 29. We expect the stock to likely trade higher with both revenues and earnings beating market expectations in the upcoming first quarter results. AEO stock has increased 9% from around $21 to $23 since the beginning of this year, outperforming the broader indices, with the S&P growing 11% over the same period. In sharp contrast, AEO\u2019s peer Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s stock (NYSE: ANF) has seen its stock rise 70% over the same period. American Eagle\u2019s Aerie brand has shown impressive growth despite the macroeconomic environment. While its namesake brand has struggled with tough comparisons to its post-pandemic recovery, its revenues grew 11% year-over-year (y-o-y) in the fourth quarter. American Eagle brand\u2019s growth figure was still lower than what the company achieved in Q4 2019, but it had many more stores (940 stores) at that point than it does today (851). We expect the company\u2019s social media activities, e-commerce growth, lack of debt, and focus on Aerie to likely give the business greater flexibility. Due to easier comparisons with the first half of last year and one less selling week in the fourth quarter, AEO expects revenue and profit growth to be skewed to the first half of this year. AEO stock has shown strong gains of 25% from levels of $20 in early January 2021 to around $23 now, vs. an increase of about 40% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the increase in AEO stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 26% in 2021, -45% in 2022, and 52% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 24% in 2023 - indicating that AEO underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including AMZN, TSLA, and TM, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could AEO face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? Our forecast indicates that American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle Outfitters \u2019 valuation is around $26 per share, which is 12% higher than the current market price.

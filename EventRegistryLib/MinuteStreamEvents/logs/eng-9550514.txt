His lawyers have told court that he admits to the killings but is not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nCrown prosecutors are opposing the defence.\n\nThey allege Skibicki targeted Indigenous women at Winnipeg homeless shelters and assaulted the four victims before killing them and disposing of their bodies.\n\n\"This case is about a man's hate-filled and cruel acts perpetrated against four vulnerable Indigenous women,\" prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere told court.\n\nShe said Skibicki staked out homeless shelters to find his victims, then devised a calculated scheme about what he would do with them.\n\n\"He preyed on these women in Winnipeg shelters and invited them back to his home, where he assaulted them, often sexually, and killed them,\" Lagimodiere said.\n\n\"He engaged in vile, sexual acts with their bodies. He then disposed of the women as though they were garbage.\"\n\nThree of the victims have been identified: Rebecca Contois of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, and Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran of Long Plain First Nation. The fourth has not been identified but Indigenous leaders have given her the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nThe remains of Contois were found in a dumpster and at a landfill. The remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill. Police have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nFamily members of the three identified women filled the courtroom as bundles of tobacco wrapped in red cloth were passed out to people in the gallery to hold onto as a form of good medicine.\n\nThey heard that Skibicki was picked up by police shortly after some remains of Contois were found in May 2022.\n\nHe was held in custody for almost 24 hours and interrogated for seven of those hours. An edited version of the interview was played in court.\n\nWhile being questioned about Contois's gruesome death, he blurted out that he had killed others.\n\n\"I killed four people,\" Skibicki says in the video, unprompted.\n\nHe told police he was coming off of psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, when he killed Buffalo Woman. Before killing the other three, he took methamphetamine.\n\nSkibicki told officers he believed the killing was racially motivated, saying he felt that he was never able to connect with someone who was Indigenous. He also said during his interrogation that he was a Holocaust denier and believed there was a systemic genocide of white people.\n\nHe said he got \"sloppy\" when it came to disposing of Contois's remains.\n\n\"Do you think you would have stopped (killing women)?\" one officer asked Skibicki. He replied no.\n\nCourt also heard Skibicki was abusive toward animals as a youth and that the cruelty continued into his young adult years.\n\nSkibicki told officers he suffered from borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHe said he believes his issues stem from being molested as a child. He said he became attracted to women who were unconscious, intoxicated or dead.\n\nHe asked to see an Eastern Orthodox priest, telling police, \"Knowing that I may be incarcerated, I know that I may never have that opportunity again ... I should confess my sins to God.\"\n\nA finding of not criminally responsible means an accused was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act due to a mental disorder.

He initially pleaded not guilty.\n\nSkibicki's defence lawyers have admitted the 37-year-old accused did kill these women, but argue he should be found not criminally responsible by way of mental disorder.\n\nThe Crown is asking the court to find Skibicki guilty of all four counts of first-degree murder.\n\n\"The Crown's theory is that the accused devised a calculated scheme,\" Lagimodiere said.\n\n\"He preyed on these women at Winnipeg shelters and invited them back to his home where he assaulted them, often sexually, and killed them... He then disposed of the women as though they were garbage.\"\n\nLagimodiere, in her opening arguments, alleged Skibicki invited Buffalo Woman to his apartment on March 15, 2022 - where he drowned her in his bathtub and \"did horrible things to her body\" before disposing of her.\n\nShe alleged over a two-week period in May 2022, Skbicki invited Contois, Harris and Myran to his apartment where he killed them, 'defiled' and disposed the bodies.\n\nIn an agreed statement of facts, the court was told DNA of Contois, Harris and Myran were found in Skibicki's apartment.\n\nSkibicki's defence has admitted to the killings. However, the details of the crimes have not been agreed to in court.\n\nDuring the trial, the Crown played a recording of a 911 call from a man who had found the partial remains of an Indigenous woman while looking through garbage bins in a North Kildonan back lane on May 16, 2022.\n\nThe remains were later identified as Contois.\n\nSkibicki was arrested in connection with Contois' death on May 17, 2022. A video of Skibicki's interview with two homicide detectives following his arrest was played as evidence in the trial Wednesday.\n\n\"I really just want to see how far, you know, I could take things because the criminal system is a joke,\" Skibicki is heard telling the two detectives in the video.\n\n\"I was driven to do stuff like this because I was so, so spent emotionally. I killed four people.\"\n\nThe subsequent investigation led police to discover further remains of Contois in Winnipeg's Brady Landfill in 2022.

She has been named Buffalo Woman (Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe) by Indigenous leaders.\n\nSkibicki \"preyed on these women at shelters and invited them back to his home where he assaulted them, often sexually, and killed them,\" Lagimodiere said. \"He engaged in vile sexual acts with their bodies, he then disposed of their remains as though they were garbage.\"\n\nSkibicki has admitted he \"committed an unlawful act\" by killing the women, but is claiming he should be found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.\n\nSkibicki was arrested May 17, 2022, one day after a man searching for scrap metal around 5:30 a.m. found Rebecca Contois's head in a plastic bag in a garbage bin on Edison Avenue, a short distance from Skibicki's McKay Avenue suite in North Kildonan.\n\n\"It's a human ... human female,\" the man said on a 911 recording played for court.\n\nWinnipeg Police Service Det. Sgt. Greg Allan, one of two officers who interrogated Skibicki over nearly 24 hours, said Skibicki showed no signs of mental distress or that he was suffering from hallucinations while in their custody.\n\n\"We had no concerns as to his mental health,\" Allan said.\n\nSkibicki sat in the prisoner's box flanked by two sheriff's officers, sipping on a cup of water as he watched his police interrogation play out on a large wall-mounted video screen.\n\nInvestigators had confronted Skibicki with surveillance video evidence and footwear impressions placing him at the location where Contois's remains had been found when, four hours into a 20-hour-plus interview, he asked to see an Orthodox priest \"to confess my sins\" and admitted to killing Contois and three other women.\n\n\"At this time, I want to express you have done a very good job, you obviously aren't stupid,\" Skibicki told investigators. \"I really just want to see how far I could take things, because the criminal justice system is a joke ... I killed four people.\"\n\nSkibicki, who earlier in the interrogation talked to a legal aid lawyer, declined a second offer to speak to a lawyer, saying: \"I am going to plead guilty to all of it.\"\n\nOn video, Skibicki sat with his legs crossed, his hands resting on his lap as he casually told investigators how he killed and disposed of the women, identifying two of them, Contois and Harris, by name.\n\nSkibicki said he met the victim identified in court as Buffalo Woman outside of the Salvation Army. Skibicki said he took her to his home and attacked her as she was preparing to leave, believing she had stolen some of his property.\n\n\"I started to choke her. I thought she was dead, but she wasn't,\" he said. \"When I was undressing her she became consciously aware. The last thing she said was f -- you.\"\n\nSkibicki said he sexually violated the woman's corpse before disposing of her body in a nearby outdoor garbage bin.\n\nSkibicki said about a month later he met Harris, whom he had known previously, outside Siloam Mission. He said she had been barred from the mission and invited her to his home. Skibicki said he filled the bathtub with water as Harris went outside for a smoke.\n\n\"I wasn't going to let her have that, but I was thinking ... this is going to be her last smoke, so I let her enjoy that,\" Skibicki said.\n\nSkibicki said he tried to push Harris into the tub, and when she resisted, put her in a headlock.\n\n\"She kind of collapsed, with her head in the tub,\" he said. Harris fought back and Skibicki drowned her.\n\nHe said he had sex with Harris's corpse several times before disposing of her body in a garbage bin behind a nearby Midas Muffler shop.\n\nSkibicki said he dismembered Contois and the victim now known to be Myran with a combat knife. Asked by investigators if he had any butchering or hunting experience and what knowledge he had of how to cut up bodies, Skibicki laughed and said: \"Instinct.\"\n\nHe said he met Myran in a back lane between the Salvation Army and Siloam Mission and invited her to his place.\n\nSkibicki said he told the woman he was interested in a relationship, but she \"was just using me for a place to stay.\"\n\nHe said they were having sex and she \"didn't let me finish\" when he \"started to get a little rough with her.\"\n\nWhen Myran tried to leave, he strangled her. He admitted sexually violating her corpse several times.\n\n\"I was pretty sure I could get away with it, but I got sloppy.\"-Jeremy Skibicki\n\nSkibicki said he realized he would be unable to lift Myran's body into a garbage bin.\n\n\"That was the first time I cut up a body,\" he said.\n\nOver 12 hours, Skibicki dismembered Myran in a bathtub full of water and Pine-Sol.\n\n\"It took a long time to cut the body into pieces,\" he said, later adding he couldn't remember where he disposed of her remains.\n\nSkibicki said he met Contois for the first time on a bus a couple of months before her death, and she began staying at his place. She left for a time and when she returned said she loved Skibicki, he said.\n\n\"I knew she was just bullshitting me to get what she wanted. That's probably one of the reasons I did what I did, because I saw through it,\" he said.\n\nSkibicki said he and Contois were having sex when she wanted him to stop and they started fighting.\n\n\"I put her in a chokehold ... choked her to death.\"\n\nAgain, Skibicki sexually violated Contois after killing her, and then put her body in a bathtub and dismembered her.\n\nSkibicki described the murders as \"mercy killings\" and said he was \"directed by God,\" telling investigators he was driven by a white supremacist ideology and that he didn't believe \"that races are meant to be forced to live together.\"\n\n\"I believe now it was (the victims') time,\" he said. \"I believe ... extreme desperate measures need to be taken for the survival of my people.\"\n\n\"I believe this was God calling me,\" he said. \"It was something I decided to do because I thought I was right.\"\n\nSkibicki said he likely would have killed more women if he hadn't been caught. Police arrested him May 18, 2022 in the death of Contois. He was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and Buffalo Woman on Dec. 1, 2022.\n\n\"I was pretty sure I could get away with it, but I got sloppy,\" Skibicki said.\n\n\"I wanted to (stop), but I don't think I could have.\"\n\nSkibicki said he got the idea to dispose the victims' remains in the garbage after reading about the case of Shawn Lamb and timed the disposal to coincide with scheduled garbage pickups.\n\nLamb was sentenced in 2013 to 20 years in prison for the killings of Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and 18-year-old Lorna Blacksmith.\n\nSkibicki described other steps he took to avoid detection, including ensuring no one knew the victims had been with him and targeting women with no social media presence.\n\nSkibicki told police he aborted plans to kill at least one woman because of her social media footprint.\n\nThe trial resumes today with testimony from police officers who are expected to tell court about evidence seized from Skibicki's home and other locations.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Through his lawyers, he admitted in court to killing the women in Winnipeg, but argues he is not criminally responsible for the deaths due to a mental disorder.\n\nRobert Karrass, a Toronto-based lawyer and legal analyst, says this type of defence is not easy to prove.\n\n\"They would have to have quite a bit of evidence to suggest that not only is he suffering from a mental disorder and that there's a history of mental disorder, but also that it was affecting his ability to know right from wrong,\" he said.\n\n\"It's really an uphill battle for him.\"\n\nTypically, the accused will undergo a forensic psychiatric assessment to help determine their mental state, Karass says. In many cases, the defence and crown prosecutor each select a forensic expert to perform the review, unless they can both agree on one.\n\n\"Oftentimes it boils down to a battle of the experts,\" Karrass said.\n\nBrian Pfefferle, a criminal defence lawyer based in Saskatoon, has been involved in several cases where the accused argues they are not criminally responsible.\n\nThe argument is part of an \"extremely complex area of law\" that can add delays to the trial in the range of three months to one year, according to Pfefferle.\n\n\"This is a process which absolutely is not a fast-food justice process. It does take significant time,\" he said.\n\nThe Court of King's Bench of Manitoba building is shown in Winnipeg on Monday, April 29, 2024.

But why did he do it?\" Karrass said.\n\nSkibicki admits to killing Rebecca Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unknown woman, whom Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe or Buffalo Woman.\n\nPolice found the partial remains of Contois in a Winnipeg dumpster and landfill in 2022.\n\nOfficers believe the remains of Harris and Myran are located in another landfill near Winnipeg. Government funding has been dedicated to searching the landfill, but a timeline for the search has not been set.\n\nIf the judge disagrees with the defence, and finds Skibicki criminally responsible for the deaths, Karrass says the accused will be convicted of murder.\n\nIf he is deemed not criminally responsible, a review board would decide where Skibicki goes next, which could include spending time in a custodial facility such as a psychiatric centre.\n\n\"His essential freedom would be governed by the review board,\" Pfefferle said.\n\n\"The focus would be on public safety. So it would be extremely unusual for someone facing a very, very serious charge to be released promptly without conditions.\"\n\nSkibicki's case is due back in a Winnipeg courtroom on Wednesday when the judge is expected to dismiss the jury.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_of_Manitoba", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Court of King's Bench of Manitoba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Criminology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Criminology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/5/7/skibicki-trial-1-6877453-1715118170858.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550514", "eventUri": "eng-9550514", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

A courtroom in Winnipeg is expected to hear today testimony today about the search for the remains of the four victims of Jeremy Skibicki. THE CANADIAN PRESS/John WoodsWINNIPEG - A Winnipeg trial has heard the belongings of two slain women were found in the apartment of an admitted serial killer. A police officer who searched the home of Jeremy Skibicki has testified clothing and jewelry belonging to Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran were discovered in the man's suite. Skibicki is charged with first-degree murder in the slayings of four Indigenous women in 2022. He has admitted to the killings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness. The Crown says the killings were racially-motivated and that Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters.

Their deaths have sparked calls for action to do more to protect Indigenous women and girls.\n\nJeremy Skibicki, 37, is charged with first-degree murder in all four deaths. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts.\n\nHis lawyers say he admits to killing the women but will argue he was not criminally responsible for the deaths due to mental disorder, when his judge-only trial begins in Winnipeg on May 8. It's expected to continue until June 6.\n\nAccording to court documents and hearings, Skibicki has threatened to kill two previous partners in recent years. He was convicted of assaulting one of those women and charged with assault in connection with the other.\n\nThe charges in the latter case were stayed, a few months before Skibicki is alleged to have killed the first of the four victims.\n\nPosts on a Facebook page linked to Skibicki, dated before his arrest in 2022, were rife with violent sentiments, as well as antisemitic, misogynistic and white supremacist material.\n\nHere's a timeline of what else we know so far about the four women Winnipeg police say were the victims of an alleged serial killer, the man accused of killing them and the push for the search of a Winnipeg-area landfill for the remains of two of the women.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nJeremy Skibicki's lawyers say he admits to killing all four women but argue he's not criminally responsible for the killings due to mental illness, Crown attorney Christian Vanderhooft says in a Winnipeg court.\n\nProsecutors also announce that the trial, scheduled to begin May 8, will be heard by a judge only, since the Crown says it no longer has to prove Skibicki caused the women's deaths.\n\nDefence attorneys had previously argued the trial should be heard by judge alone, rather than a jury, but a judge denied that motion.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nA judge rules Skibicki's trial will be heard by a jury, following a second attempt by his lawyers to have the case heard by a judge alone.\n\nThe defence raised concerns about the possible effects of media coverage on the jury.\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nA jury of 12 people, plus two alternates, is selected for Skibicki's upcoming trial.\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nManitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismisses an attempt by Skibicki's lawyers to quash the first-degree murder charges in the death of the woman known as Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. The defence had argued the fact that there is no victim identified or body found made the charge what's known as a \"nullity,\" meaning it has no legal force.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nThe federal and provincial governments each commit $20 million toward the search of the Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, for the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran.\n\nAnother $500,000 from the province will go toward supporting the victims' families during Skibicki's trial, the province announces. The federal government also committed an additional $200,000 for the mental well-being of the families.\n\nWinnipeg police previously said they believe the remains of Harris and Myran are at the landfill, which is north of Winnipeg.\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\nProtesters rally in downtown Winnipeg, calling on Premier Wab Kinew to deliver on his promise to search the landfill for the two women's remains.\n\nKinew promised during the 2023 election campaign he'd support a search, and reiterated this commitment following his party's election win on Oct. 3.\n\nJan. 26, 2024\n\nA new report on the feasibility of searching Prairie Green landfill says the search could cost $90 million, about half of the $184 million projected in a feasibility report completed the previous year.\n\nSkibicki pleads not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder on the first day of pretrial motions in his case.\n\nHis lawyers argue his case should be heard by a judge only, instead of the jury trial that was initially scheduled.\n\nThe case is automatically slated to be heard before a jury because it involves first-degree murder charges. A trial by judge alone would require the consent of Crown prosecutors.\n\nOct. 4, 2023\n\nThe federal government commits $740,000 to further review a search of the Prairie Green landfill, one day after Kinew was elected premier.\n\nSept. 23, 2023\n\nA full-page Progressive Conservative election ad says then premier Heather Stefanson's government would \"stand firm\" in its refusal to search the Prairie Green landfill if re-elected. It runs in the Winnipeg Free Press, less than two weeks before the 2023 Manitoba election.\n\nThe party also rolled out radio and billboard ads around this time, which Stefanson later apologized for following her election defeat. The ads were condemned during her campaign by families of Harris and Myran.\n\nAug. 3, 2023\n\nA round dance and rally is held at Winnipeg's Portage and Main intersection to call for a search of the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nEarlier in the day, families of Harris and Myran met with federal Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree.\n\nHis spokesperson told CBC News in a statement that Canada is committed to acting on the landfill search, but needs support from the provincial government.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nCity crews tear down a blockade at Winnipeg's Brady Road landfill, four days after a judge granted an injunction ordering protesters to clear the road.\n\nProtesters blocked the road to the city-run landfill after then premier Heather Stefanson said her government would not support a search of Prairie Green.\n\nA new protest camp was then set up near the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg.\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nProtesters blocked the entrance road to the Brady Road landfill, demanding the government search the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nJuly 5, 2023\n\nManitoba's Progressive Conservative government says it will not support a search of the Prairie Green landfill, citing concerns over searchers' health and safety.\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says a study examining whether a successful search of the Prairie Green landfill is possible determined the effort could take up to three years and cost as much as $184 million.\n\nWinnipeg police previously said they believe the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran are at the landfill north of Winnipeg.\n\nFeb. 8, 2023\n\nThe federal government says it will provide $500,000 to fund a study on whether remains could be recovered through a search of the Prairie Green landfill. The update comes after Ottawa said in December that it would cover the cost of that feasibility study.\n\nJan. 24, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says it's been told no garbage has been dumped in the targeted section of the facility since June.\n\nJan. 17, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says it expects to complete a feasibility study on whether it's possible to recover the two women's remains by March 31.\n\nThe First Nations advocacy group is part of a landfill search committee that says while it is also pursuing a request to search Winnipeg's Brady Road landfill, it's currently focusing on Prairie Green.\n\nJan. 6, 2023\n\nWinnipeg's Brady Road landfill reopens to the public after protesters calling for a search of the dump blocked access for weeks. Demonstrators wanted the dump searched for the remains of missing people, months after the partial remains of Rebecca Contois were discovered there in June.\n\nThe same day, a spokesperson for the city says the cell where Contois's remains were found hasn't been in use since.\n\nPremier Heather Stefanson also clarified that only one cell in the privately run landfill has had its operations paused indefinitely as next steps are determined, after previously announcing operations were being paused at the entire landfill.\n\nDec. 15, 2022\n\nThe federal government confirms it will cover the cost of a study about whether remains could be recovered through a search of the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nDec. 9, 2022\n\nThe chair of Winnipeg's police board says officials are trying to find a way to search for the remains of Harris and Myran in the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nPolice say they believe Harris and Myran's remains are at the Prairie Green landfill, but say it wouldn't be feasible to search for them there.\n\nEarlier the same day, Harris's daughters Cambria and Kera call on police to do whatever it takes to find the remains of their mother and the other women killed.\n\nDec. 4, 2022\n\nA previously unnamed woman who police allege was killed by Skibicki is given a name by the community: Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nPolice previously said she's believed to be Indigenous and in her 20s, but won't say how they determined that.\n\nDec. 1, 2022\n\nPolice announce Skibicki has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and the woman who will later be given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe was already in custody, having been charged with one other count of first-degree murder in Contois's death months earlier.\n\nSept. 26, 2022\n\nMyran's family reports her missing, months after she was last seen. This is also around the time when police issue a missing person release about her through the Bear Clan Patrol to solicit information from the public.\n\nMyran's grandmother, Donna Bartlett, said Myran's mother was initially afraid to go to the police because she was scared to learn that something had happened to her.\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nPolice announce human remains found at the city-run Brady Road landfill in Winnipeg a week earlier have been identified as those of Rebecca Contois.\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nHomicide investigators determine Harris and Myran's remains were likely at the Prairie Green landfill, but do not disclose this publicly until December.\n\nSometime around this date, the police forensics team is also notified.\n\nPolice announce they've found partial human remains at the Brady Road landfill in Winnipeg during a two-week search connected with the killing of Contois.\n\nAround this time, garbage stops getting dumped in the Prairie Green landfill cell where Harris's and Myran's remains are believed to be.\n\nThat fact isn't disclosed publicly until months later, in January 2023, when it's shared by the group overseeing efforts to determine whether it's feasible to search the landfill for the women's remains.\n\nThey also identify Contois as the person whose partial remains were discovered near a North Kildonan apartment building earlier that week.\n\nPolice say they've executed a search warrant on Skibicki's residence and announce a potential scene has been identified at the Brady Road landfill.\n\nBecause of the circumstances, police say investigators have not ruled out the possibility of more victims.\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\nPolice arrest Skibicki in connection with the death of the woman they will later identify as Contois.\n\nThat search was prompted after partial remains, later confirmed to belong to Contois, were found.\n\nThis is also the day police believe the remains of Harris and Myran were transported to the Prairie Green landfill, and the day police say Harris was reported missing.\n\nMay 14 or 15, 2022\n\nPolice allege Skibicki killed Contois on or around one of these dates, court documents show.\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\nPolice allege Skibicki killed Myran on or around this date, court documents show.\n\nMay 1, 2022\n\nPolice allege Skibicki killed Harris on or around this date, court documents show.\n\nThis was also the date Harris was last seen, near the area of Main Street and Henry Avenue in Winnipeg, police say later in May, when they announce she is missing.\n\nMarch 15, 2022\n\nPolice believe Skibicki killed the woman the community has named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, on or around this date, court documents say.\n\nThis is also the last time Myran had contact with her family, her grandmother says, and the day police say she was listed as last being seen.\n\nThe Crown stays assault charges against Skibicki stemming from an alleged attack on his estranged wife almost a year earlier.\n\nA spokesperson for the province later says those charges were re-evaluated after a judge \"made findings about the reliability\" of the woman's testimony in a separate trial involving Skibicki and his estranged wife around the same time.\n\nDec. 14, 2021\n\nA judge acquits Skibicki in a trial connected with an alleged violation of an order that banned him from contacting his estranged wife. The judge said he found her testimony unreliable due to her memory issues.\n\nThe woman's mother says her daughter was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome after an earlier alleged attack involving Skibicki, and that had an effect on her memory.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nA friend of Skibicki -- who spent time with the accused at an apartment Skibicki lived in from this time until his arrest in May 2022 -- said Skibicki went to Winnipeg shelters for meals.\n\nThe friend said Skibicki took the bus daily to N'Dinawemak for breakfast and lunch, and often went to Siloam Mission for dinner.\n\nDuring Skibicki's time in the apartment, the friend said he saw about half a dozen women he believes were Indigenous come and go, though Skibicki told him he'd had at least 30 women stay with him for varying periods of time.\n\nThe women often carried bags with what appeared to be clothing and other belongings, he said. He also often saw drug paraphernalia in Skibicki's apartment after the women left.\n\n\"Now that I look back, it's predatory behaviour,\" he said. \"You know, he's looking for the absolute most vulnerable.\"\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nSkibicki's estranged wife alleges her husband assaulted her.\n\nThe woman's mother says it involved an incident in which her daughter was chased down an apartment hallway with a knife. The incident left the woman with injuries from being punched in the head and hit over the head with a cane, according to her mother.\n\nSkibicki is later charged with assault with a weapon and assault causing bodily harm, but those charges end up being stayed.\n\nSept. 4, 2019\n\nA year after they got married, Skibicki's estranged wife is granted a protection order against him for three years. She alleges in both an application for the order and a hearing that she suffered a litany of abuse at his hands and that he threatened to kill her.\n\nSept. 4, 2018\n\nSkibicki marries the woman who is his now-estranged wife. She later says in a protection order hearing that she was \"under the influence\" on their wedding day and went to detox for meth four days later.\n\nDec. 21, 2015\n\nA different woman, who is then Skibicki's common-law partner, files for a protection order against him, saying in her application she feared \"he won't stop until I'm dead.\"\n\nHer request is dismissed. It's not clear why, but the conditions of Skibicki's probation from a conviction for an assault against her months before required that he stay away from his partner and not make contact for two years.\n\nSkibicki is convicted of assaulting his common-law partner. After spending about two months behind bars, he's sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nJune 15, 2015\n\nSkibicki assaults his common-law partner. According to a statement of facts later agreed to by Crown and defence attorneys, Skibicki grabbed his pregnant partner's hair and punched her in the face several times, then tried to strangle her. He also told her he would kill her if she called police.\n\nSupport is available for anyone affected by details of this case.

His lawyers have told court that he admits to the killings but is not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nCrown prosecutors are opposing the defence.\n\nThey allege Skibicki targeted Indigenous women at Winnipeg homeless shelters and assaulted the four victims before killing them and disposing of their bodies.\n\n\"This case is about a man's hate-filled and cruel acts perpetrated against four vulnerable Indigenous women,\" prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere told court.\n\nShe said Skibicki staked out homeless shelters to find his victims, then devised a calculated scheme about what he would do with them.\n\n\"He preyed on these women in Winnipeg shelters and invited them back to his home, where he assaulted them, often sexually, and killed them,\" Lagimodiere said.\n\n\"He engaged in vile, sexual acts with their bodies. He then disposed of the women as though they were garbage.\"\n\nThree of the victims have been identified: Rebecca Contois of O-Chi-Chak-Ko-Sipi First Nation, and Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran of Long Plain First Nation. The fourth has not been identified but Indigenous leaders have given her the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nThe remains of Contois were found in a dumpster and at a landfill. The remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill. Police have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nFamily members of the three identified women filled the courtroom as bundles of tobacco wrapped in red cloth were passed out to people in the gallery to hold onto as a form of good medicine.\n\nThey heard that Skibicki was picked up by police shortly after some remains of Contois were found in May 2022.\n\nHe was held in custody for almost 24 hours and interrogated for seven of those hours. An edited version of the interview was played in court.\n\nWhile being questioned about Contois's gruesome death, he blurted out that he had killed others.\n\n\"I killed four people,\" Skibicki says in the video, unprompted.\n\nHe told police he was coming off of psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, when he killed Buffalo Woman. Before killing the other three, he took methamphetamine.\n\nGRAPHIC WARNING: The following details may disturb some readers.\n\nThe Crown detailed the killings in court.\n\nLagimodiere said Skibicki forcibly confined Buffalo Woman, believed to be an Indigenous woman in her mid-20s, choked her and drowned her.\n\nSkibicki put Harris, 39, in a headlock, and she collapsed with her head in a tub full of water, said Lagimodiere. He disposed of her body in a garbage bin.\n\nLagimodiere said Skibicki was having sex with Myran and got rough with her. He then put the 26-year-old in a headlock and choked her. He later dismembered her, said the prosecutor.\n\nSkibicki assaulted Contois when the 24-year-old told him to get off of her during sex. He then choked her, smothered her with a pillow and dismembered her in a bathtub, said Lagimodiere.\n\nPolice were alerted to the killing of Contois by a 911 call, which was played in court, from a man who found a head in a dumpster behind an apartment building.\n\nFamily members of Contois later left the courtroom when the Crown began playing the police interrogation video.\n\nSkibicki told officers he believed the killing was racially motivated, saying he felt that he was never able to connect with someone who was Indigenous. He also said during his interrogation that he was a Holocaust denier and believed there was a systemic genocide of white people.\n\nHe said he got \"sloppy\" when it came to disposing of Contois's remains.\n\n\"Do you think you would have stopped (killing women)?\" one officer asked Skibicki. He replied no.\n\nCourt also heard Skibicki was abusive toward animals as a youth and that the cruelty continued into his young adult years.\n\nSkibicki told officers he suffered from borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nHe said he believes his issues stem from being molested as a child. He said he became attracted to women who were unconscious, intoxicated or dead.\n\nHe asked to see an Eastern Orthodox priest, telling police, \"Knowing that I may be incarcerated, I know that I may never have that opportunity again ... I should confess my sins to God.\"\n\nA finding of not criminally responsible means an accused was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act due to a mental disorder. The person is detained in a hospital until a review board determines they are no longer a threat to the public.\n\nThe federal government has a support line for those affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: 1-844-413-6649.

Their deaths have sparked calls for action to do more to protect Indigenous women and girls.\n\nJeremy Skibicki, 37, is charged with first-degree murder in all four deaths. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts.\n\nHis lawyers say he admits to killing the women but they will argue he was not criminally responsible for the deaths due to mental disorder, when his judge-only trial begins in Winnipeg on May 8. It's expected to continue until June 6.\n\nAccording to court documents and hearings, Skibicki has threatened to kill two previous partners in recent years. He was convicted of assaulting one of those women and charged with assault in connection with the other.\n\nThe charges in the latter case were stayed, a few months before Skibicki is believed to have killed the first of the four victims.\n\nPosts on a Facebook page linked to Skibicki, dated before his arrest in 2022, were rife with violent sentiments, as well as antisemitic, misogynistic and white supremacist material.\n\nHere's a timeline of what else we know so far about the four women Winnipeg police say were the victims of a serial killer, the man accused of killing them and the push for the search of a Winnipeg-area landfill for the remains of two of the women.\n\nMay 6, 2024\n\nJeremy Skibicki's lawyers say he admits to killing all four women but argue he's not criminally responsible for the killings due to mental illness, Crown attorney Christian Vanderhooft says in a Winnipeg court.\n\nProsecutors also announce that the trial, scheduled to begin May 8, will be heard by a judge only, since the Crown says it no longer has to prove Skibicki caused the women's deaths.\n\nDefence attorneys had previously argued the trial should be heard by judge alone, rather than a jury, but a judge denied that motion.\n\nMay 3, 2024\n\nA judge rules Skibicki's trial will be heard by a jury, following a second attempt by his lawyers to have the case heard by a judge alone.\n\nThe defence raised concerns about the possible effects of media coverage on the jury.\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nA jury of 12 people, plus two alternates, is selected for Skibicki's upcoming trial.\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nManitoba Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal dismisses an attempt by Skibicki's lawyers to quash the first-degree murder charges in the death of the woman known as Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. The defence had argued the fact that there is no victim identified or body found made the charge what's known as a \"nullity,\" meaning it has no legal force.\n\nMarch 22, 2024\n\nThe federal and provincial governments each commit $20 million toward the search of the Prairie Green landfill, north of Winnipeg, for the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran.\n\nAnother $500,000 from the province will go toward supporting the victims' families during Skibicki's trial, the province announces. The federal government also committed an additional $200,000 for the mental well-being of the families.\n\nWinnipeg police previously said they believe the remains of Harris and Myran are at the landfill, which is north of Winnipeg.\n\nMarch 8, 2024\n\nProtesters rally in downtown Winnipeg, calling on Premier Wab Kinew to deliver on his promise to search the landfill for the two women's remains.\n\nKinew promised during the 2023 election campaign he'd support a search, and reiterated this commitment following his party's election win on Oct. 3.\n\nJan. 26, 2024\n\nA new report on the feasibility of searching Prairie Green landfill says the search could cost $90 million, about half of the $184 million projected in a feasibility report completed the previous year.\n\nSkibicki pleads not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder on the first day of pretrial motions in his case.\n\nHis lawyers argue his case should be heard by a judge only, instead of the jury trial that was initially scheduled.\n\nThe case is automatically slated to be heard before a jury because it involves first-degree murder charges. A trial by judge alone would require the consent of Crown prosecutors.\n\nOct. 4, 2023\n\nThe federal government commits $740,000 to further review a search of the Prairie Green landfill, one day after Kinew was elected premier.\n\nSept. 23, 2023\n\nA full-page Progressive Conservative election ad says then premier Heather Stefanson's government would \"stand firm\" in its refusal to search the Prairie Green landfill if re-elected. It runs in the Winnipeg Free Press, less than two weeks before the 2023 Manitoba election.\n\nThe party also rolled out radio and billboard ads around this time, which Stefanson later apologized for following her election defeat. The ads were condemned during her campaign by families of Harris and Myran.\n\nAug. 3, 2023\n\nA round dance and rally is held at Winnipeg's Portage and Main intersection to call for a search of the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nEarlier in the day, families of Harris and Myran met with federal Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Gary Anandasangaree.\n\nHis spokesperson told CBC News in a statement that Canada is committed to acting on the landfill search, but needs support from the provincial government.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nCity crews tear down a blockade at Winnipeg's Brady Road landfill, four days after a judge granted an injunction ordering protesters to clear the road.\n\nProtesters blocked the road to the city-run landfill after then premier Heather Stefanson said her government would not support a search of Prairie Green.\n\nA new protest camp was then set up near the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg.\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nProtesters blocked the entrance road to the Brady Road landfill, demanding the government search the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nJuly 5, 2023\n\nManitoba's Progressive Conservative government says it will not support a search of the Prairie Green landfill, citing concerns over searchers' health and safety.\n\nMay 12, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says a study examining whether a successful search of the Prairie Green landfill is possible determined the effort could take up to three years and cost as much as $184 million.\n\nWinnipeg police previously said they believe the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran are at the landfill north of Winnipeg.\n\nFeb. 8, 2023\n\nThe federal government says it will provide $500,000 to fund a study on whether remains could be recovered through a search of the Prairie Green landfill. The update comes after Ottawa said in December that it would cover the cost of that feasibility study.\n\nJan. 24, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says it's been told no garbage has been dumped in the targeted section of the facility since June.\n\nJan. 17, 2023\n\nThe Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs says it expects to complete a feasibility study on whether it's possible to recover the two women's remains by March 31.\n\nThe First Nations advocacy group is part of a landfill search committee that says while it is also pursuing a request to search Winnipeg's Brady Road landfill, it's currently focusing on Prairie Green.\n\nJan. 6, 2023\n\nWinnipeg's Brady Road landfill reopens to the public after protesters calling for a search of the dump blocked access for weeks. Demonstrators wanted the dump searched for the remains of missing people, months after the partial remains of Rebecca Contois were discovered there in June.\n\nThe same day, a spokesperson for the city says the cell where Contois's remains were found hasn't been in use since.\n\nPremier Heather Stefanson also clarified that only one cell in the privately run landfill has had its operations paused indefinitely as next steps are determined, after previously announcing operations were being paused at the entire landfill.\n\nDec. 15, 2022\n\nThe federal government confirms it will cover the cost of a study about whether remains could be recovered through a search of the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nDec. 9, 2022\n\nThe chair of Winnipeg's police board says officials are trying to find a way to search for the remains of Harris and Myran in the Prairie Green landfill.\n\nPolice say they believe Harris's and Myran's remains are at the Prairie Green landfill, but say it wouldn't be feasible to search for them.\n\nEarlier the same day, Harris's daughters Cambria and Kera call on police to do whatever it takes to find the remains of their mother and the other slain women.\n\nDec. 4, 2022\n\nA previously unnamed woman who police say was killed by Skibicki is given a name by the community: Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nPolice previously said she's believed to be Indigenous and in her 20s, but won't say how they determined that.\n\nDec. 1, 2022\n\nPolice announce Skibicki has been charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and the woman who will later be given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe was already in custody, having been charged with one other count of first-degree murder in Contois's death months earlier.\n\nSept. 26, 2022\n\nMyran's family reports her missing, months after she was last seen. This is also around the time when police issue a missing person release about her through the Bear Clan Patrol to solicit information from the public.\n\nMyran's grandmother, Donna Bartlett, said Myran's mother was initially afraid to go to the police because she was scared to learn that something had happened to her.\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nPolice announce human remains found at the city-run Brady Road landfill in Winnipeg a week earlier have been identified as those of Rebecca Contois.\n\nJune 20, 2022\n\nHomicide investigators determine Harris's and Myran's remains were likely at the Prairie Green landfill, but do not disclose this publicly until December.\n\nSometime around this date, the police forensics team is also notified.\n\nPolice announce they've found partial human remains at the Brady Road landfill in Winnipeg during a two-week search connected with the killing of Contois.\n\nAround this time, garbage stops getting dumped in the Prairie Green landfill cell where Harris's and Myran's remains are believed to be.\n\nThat fact isn't disclosed publicly until months later, in January 2023, when it's shared by the group overseeing efforts to determine whether it's feasible to search the landfill for the women's remains.\n\nThey also identify Contois as the person whose partial remains were discovered near a North Kildonan apartment building earlier that week.\n\nPolice say they've executed a search warrant on Skibicki's residence and announce a potential scene has been identified at the Brady Road landfill.\n\nBecause of the circumstances, police say investigators have not ruled out the possibility of more victims.\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\nPolice arrest Skibicki in connection with the death of the woman they will later identify as Contois.\n\nThat search was prompted after partial remains, later confirmed to belong to Contois, were found.\n\nThis is also the day police believe the remains of Harris and Myran were transported to the Prairie Green landfill, and the day police say Harris was reported missing.\n\nMay 14 or 15, 2022\n\nPolice believe Skibicki killed Contois on or around one of these dates, court documents show.\n\nMay 4, 2022\n\nPolice believe Skibicki killed Myran on or around this date, court documents show.\n\nMay 1, 2022\n\nPolice believe Skibicki killed Harris on or around this date, court documents show.\n\nThis was also the date Harris was last seen, near the area of Main Street and Henry Avenue in Winnipeg, police say later in May, when they announce she is missing.\n\nMarch 15, 2022\n\nPolice believe Skibicki killed the woman the community has named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, on or around this date, court documents say.\n\nThis is also the last time Myran had contact with her family, her grandmother says, and the day police say she was listed as last being seen.\n\nThe Crown stays assault charges against Skibicki stemming from an alleged attack on his estranged wife almost a year earlier.\n\nA spokesperson for the province later says those charges were re-evaluated after a judge \"made findings about the reliability\" of the woman's testimony in a separate trial involving Skibicki and his estranged wife around the same time.\n\nDec. 14, 2021\n\nA judge acquits Skibicki in a trial connected with an alleged violation of an order that barred him from contacting his estranged wife. The judge said he found her testimony unreliable due to her memory issues.\n\nThe woman's mother says her daughter was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome after an earlier alleged attack involving Skibicki, and that had an effect on her memory.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nA friend of Skibicki -- who spent time with the accused at an apartment Skibicki lived in from this time until his arrest in May 2022 -- said Skibicki went to Winnipeg shelters for meals.\n\nThe friend said Skibicki took the bus daily to N'Dinawemak for breakfast and lunch, and often went to Siloam Mission for dinner.\n\nDuring Skibicki's time in the apartment, the friend said he saw about half a dozen women he believes were Indigenous come and go, though Skibicki told him he'd had at least 30 women stay with him for varying periods of time.\n\nThe women often carried bags with what appeared to be clothing and other belongings, he said. He also often saw drug paraphernalia in Skibicki's apartment after the women left.\n\n\"Now that I look back, it's predatory behaviour,\" he said. \"You know, he's looking for the absolute most vulnerable.\"\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nSkibicki's estranged wife alleges her husband assaulted her.\n\nThe woman's mother says it involved an incident in which her daughter was chased down an apartment hallway with a knife. The incident left the woman with injuries from being punched in the head and hit over the head with a cane, according to her mother.\n\nSkibicki is later charged with assault with a weapon and assault causing bodily harm, but those charges end up being stayed.\n\nSept. 4, 2019\n\nA year after they got married, Skibicki's estranged wife is granted a protection order against him for three years. She alleges in both an application for the order and a hearing that she suffered a litany of abuse at his hands and that he threatened to kill her.\n\nSept. 4, 2018\n\nSkibicki marries the woman who is his now-estranged wife. She later says in a protection order hearing that she was \"under the influence\" on their wedding day and went to detox for meth four days later.\n\nDec. 21, 2015\n\nA different woman, who is then Skibicki's common-law partner, files for a protection order against him, saying in her application she feared \"he won't stop until I'm dead.\"\n\nHer request is dismissed. It's not clear why, but the conditions of Skibicki's probation from a conviction for an assault against her months before required that he stay away from his partner and not make contact for two years.\n\nSkibicki is convicted of assaulting his common-law partner. After spending about two months behind bars, he's sentenced to two years of probation.\n\nJune 15, 2015\n\nSkibicki assaults his common-law partner. According to a statement of facts later agreed to by Crown and defence attorneys, Skibicki grabbed his pregnant partner's hair and punched her in the face several times, then tried to strangle her. He also told her he would kill her if she called police.\n\nSupport is available for anyone affected by details of this case.

I kind of froze in my chair,\" said Det.-Sgt. Adam Danylyshen.\n\nThe other detective who was in that interview -- Greg Allan, who is set to testify Wednesday -- told court he had had no knowledge of three additional killings until Skibicki confessed.\n\nSkibicki, 37, has pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Contois and two other First Nations women -- Morgan Harris, 39 and Marcedes Myran, 26 -- as well as a fourth woman. She is still unidentified, but has been given the name Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, by community members.\n\nThis week, his lawyers said they intend to argue that while he admits he killed the women, he was not criminally responsible due to mental disorder.\n\nDuring the police interview, Skibicki admitted to strangling, choking or drowning the four women, most of whom he said he met at or near homeless shelters in Winnipeg. He also confessed to performing sex acts on their bodies in his apartment.\n\nWhile he initially told police he recognized Contois from the Siloam Mission shelter when they showed him her photo, it took some time before Skibicki provided any other details. But hours into the interview, after asking to see a priest to \"confess [his] sins,\" he ended up also telling police about the three other killings.\n\nThe Crown will present a shorter version of the interview video -- just under seven hours long -- once Skibicki's trial officially begins on Wednesday, after about a week of additional pretrial motions in the case.\n\nHis police interview also sheds light on what Skibicki told investigators about the unidentified woman known as Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe. That includes the fact he initially gave them what he said was her name, only to have police tell him they were able to locate that woman, and she was alive.\n\nSkibicki told police Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe was wearing a Baby Phat brand jacket, which he said he sold on Facebook after he killed her. Photos of that jacket were the only clue Winnipeg police had released to the public to try to identify her.\n\nSkibicki also told detectives that he dismembered some of the women before disposing of their remains in garbage bins, and that he timed some of that with garbage pickup day.\n\nCourt heard Skibicki was ordered to get down on the ground as he was arrested by a police tactical team near a bus stop on Henderson Highway in northeast Winnipeg in May 2022, not long after Contois's partial remains were discovered in a garbage bin.\n\nThe following month, police recovered more of her remains from the Brady Road landfill in south Winnipeg.\n\nSkibicki told police in his interview that he'd brought other women back to his apartment, but didn't kill them if they logged into his computer to use Facebook. In one case, he said he decided to let a woman he'd brought to his apartment leave after they had sex and he noticed she was wearing a rosary.\n\nThe accused also told police he suffers from borderline personality disorder and that he struggled with a methamphetamine addiction.\n\nPolice said their investigation determined the unidentified woman known as Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe was killed on March 15, 2022. She was the first of the women killed, followed by Harris on May 1, Myran on May 4 and Contois on May 15 of that year, according to police.\n\nInvestigators believe Myran's and Harris's remains are in the Prairie Green landfill north of Winnipeg, but they've never said where they think Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe's remains are. They have said only that they believe she was Indigenous and in her mid-20s.\n\nIn March, the Manitoba and federal governments each pledged $20 million toward searching Prairie Green for the remains of Harris and Myran.\n\nSkibicki's trial, before Court of King's Bench Chief Justice Glenn Joyal, is expected to continue until June 6.\n\nSupport is available for anyone affected by these reports and the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Immediate emotional assistance and crisis support are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week through a national hotline at 1-844-413-6649.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news",

Discretion is advised.\n\nThe trial of serial killer Jeremy Skibicki heard Thursday that police found physical evidence of the victims in his Winnipeg apartment, including jewelry, clothing, DNA and a bloodstained bathtub.\n\nConst. Jan de Vries, who was part of the police search team, testified they found bloodstains in Skibicki's bathroom belonging to one of the victims, Rebecca Contois.\n\nSome stains were visible while others were found using a spray that makes stains fluorescent when used with a black light, he said.\n\n\"The bathtub was very fluorescent,\" said de Vries. \"So was the floor, the walls and on the exterior side of the door.\"\n\nHe said the bloodstains found in the bathtub covered the entire area, which had likely been emptied and rinsed at some point.\n\nSkibicki is charged with first-degree murder for the 2022 killings of Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe has confessed to the slayings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nThe Crown said the killings were racially motivated, with Skibicki a self-proclaimed white supremacist and the four victims Indigenous.\n\nProsecutors said Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters, assaulted them, killed them and disposed of their bodies in garbage bins.\n\nRebecca Contois (left) Morgan Beatrice Harris (centre) and Marcedes Myran (right), along with a fourth unidentified woman referred to as Buffalo Woman (Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe), have been identified as the four victims of Jeremy Skibicki. (CTV Winnipeg photo)\n\nThe partial remains of Contois were found in multiple dumpsters in Skibicki's neighbourhood, as well as in a local landfill.\n\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere has told court Skibicki assaulted 24-year-old Contois during sex. He then choked her, smothered her with a pillow and dismembered her in the tub.\n\nImages from surveillance video presented in court show a person emptying bags into a bin in the neighbourhood.\n\nCourt heard that when officers went to search the bin, it had already been emptied. This led police to section off an area at the Brady Road landfill, where they ultimately found the woman's torso, said de Vries.\n\nDe Vries said that in Skibicki's suite, police found a jacket and tuque belonging to Harris and Myran's earrings and baseball cap. DNA belonging to both women was also found, as was Myran's blood on the blade of a combat-style knife.\n\nThe remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill.\n\nInvestigators have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nSkibicki told police he sold Buffalo Woman's jacket online. Police later located the reversible Baby Phat jacket, and an unidentified woman's DNA profile was found.\n\nDe Vries testified there have been substantial but unsuccessful efforts to identify that DNA.\n\nCourt heard DNA evidence from 16 females was found in the apartment and in a garbage bin in the area.

Jeremy Skibicki, 37, had pleaded not guilty to four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of 24-year-old Rebecca Contois, 39-year-old Morgan Harris, 26-year-old Marcedes Myran, and an unidentified woman given the name Buffalo Woman, and was expected to face a jury trial in Manitoba this week before his lawyers relayed the confession on Monday. \"At this point, the accused is now admitting that he killed all four women,\" Crown prosecutor Chris Vanderhooft told Manitoba's highest trial court, per the Guardian.\n\nProsecutors in Winnipeg have since agreed to a judge-only trial to begin as soon as Wednesday and last a month. \"We are no longer concerned with proving the accused has committed these offenses, but rather whether he is criminally responsible,\" Vanderhooft said, per APTN. The development means a 2022 video confession, part of a 20-hour interrogation of Skibicki, is no longer under a publication ban, the CBC reports. According to the outlet, detectives were asking questions about Contois' disappearance when Skibicki suddenly confessed to killing three more women. Detective Greg Allan, to testify Wednesday, told the court he had no knowledge of the other murders until that moment.\n\nSkibicki, who claimed to suffer from borderline personality disorder and methamphetamine addiction, said he strangled, choked, or drowned his victims, most of whom he met near Winnipeg homeless shelters. Buffalo Woman was killed on March 15, 2022, followed by Harris on May 1, Myran on May 4, and Contois on May 15, police say. Skibicki confessed to performing sex acts on their bodies before dismembering some of the victims and disposing of their remains in garbage bins. Contois' partial remains were found at Winnipeg's Brady Road landfill soon after her death. The remains of the three other victims are believed to be in the Prairie Green landfill north of Winnipeg, still to be searched, per APTN.

Const. Jan de Vries, who was part of the police search team, testified they found bloodstains in Skibicki's bathroom belonging to one of the victims, Rebecca Contois. Some stains were visible while others were found using a spray that makes stains fluorescent when used with a black light, he said. \"The bathtub was very fluorescent,\" said de Vries. \"So was the floor, the walls and on the exterior side of the door.\" He said the bloodstains found in the bathtub covered the entire area, which had likely been emptied and rinsed at some point. Skibicki is charged with first-degree murder for the 2022 killings of Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman. He has confessed to the slayings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness. The Crown said the killings were racially motivated, with Skibicki a self-proclaimed white supremacist and the four victims Indigenous. Prosecutors said Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters, assaulted them, killed them and disposed of their bodies in garbage bins. GRAPHIC WARNING: The following details may disturb some readers. The partial remains of Contois were found in multiple dumpsters in Skibicki's neighbourhood, as well as in a local landfill. Crown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere has told court Skibicki assaulted 24-year-old Contois during sex. He then choked her, smothered her with a pillow and dismembered her in the tub. Images from surveillance video presented in court show a person emptying bags into a bin in the neighbourhood. Court heard that when officers went to search the bin, it had already been emptied. This led police to section off an area at the Brady Road landfill, where they ultimately found the woman's torso, said de Vries. De Vries said that in Skibicki's suite, police found a jacket and tuque belonging to Harris and Myran's earrings and baseball cap. DNA belonging to both women was also found, as was Myran's blood on the blade of a combat-style knife. The remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill. Investigators have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located. Skibicki told police he sold Buffalo Woman's jacket online. Police later located the reversible Baby Phat jacket, and an unidentified woman's DNA profile was found. De Vries testified there have been substantial but unsuccessful efforts to identify that DNA. Court heard DNA evidence from 16 females was found in the apartment and in a garbage bin in the area. Nine of those samples were unidentified. Lagimodiere told reporters outside court that the Crown doesn't believe at this time there are more victims in the case. One identified DNA sample belonged to a missing woman. Ashlee Shingoose was last seen in downtown Winnipeg in March 2022. Shingoose's family told local media last year that they were asked to provide a DNA sample to police but it didn't come back as a match to Buffalo Woman. Police said in an email Thursday that Shingoose is still considered missing.

She has been named Buffalo Woman (Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe) by Indigenous leaders.\n\nSkibicki \"preyed on these women at shelters and invited them back to his home where he assaulted them, often sexually, and killed them,\" Lagimodiere said. \"He engaged in vile sexual acts with their bodies, he then disposed of their remains as though they were garbage.\"\n\nSkibicki has admitted he \"committed an unlawful act\" by killing the women, but is claiming he should be found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.\n\nSkibicki was arrested May 17, 2022, one day after a man searching for scrap metal around 5:30 a.m. found Rebecca Contois's head in a plastic bag in a garbage bin on Edison Avenue, a short distance from Skibicki's McKay Avenue suite in North Kildonan.\n\n\"It's a human... human female,\" the man said on a 911 recording played for court.\n\nWinnipeg Police Service Det. Sgt. Greg Allan, one of two officers who interrogated Skibicki over nearly 24 hours, said Skibicki showed no signs of mental distress or that he was suffering from hallucinations while in their custody.\n\n\"We had no concerns as to his mental health,\" Allan said.\n\nSkibicki sat in the prisoner's box flanked by two sheriff's officers, sipping on a cup of water as he watched his police interrogation play out on a large wall-mounted video screen.\n\nInvestigators had confronted Skibicki with surveillance video evidence and footwear impression evidence placing him at the location where Contois's remains had been found when four hours into a 20-hour-plus interview, he asked to see an orthodox priest \"to confess my sins\" and admitted to killing Contois and three other women.\n\n\"At this time, I want to express you have done a very good job, you obviously aren't stupid,\" Skibicki told investigators. \"I really just want to see how far I could take things, because the criminal justice system is a joke... I killed four people.\"\n\nSkibicki, who earlier in the interrogation talked to a legal aid lawyer, declined a second offer to speak to a lawyer, saying: \"I am going to plead guilty to all of it.\n\nOn video, Skibicki sat with his legs crossed, his hands resting on his lap as he casually told investigators how he killed and disposed of the women, identifying two of them, Contois and Harris, by name.\n\nSkibicki said he met the victim identified in court as Buffalo Woman outside of the Salvation Army. Skibicki said he took her to his home and attacked her as she was preparing to leave, believing she had stolen some of his property.\n\n\"I started to choke her. I thought she was dead, but she wasn't,\" he said. \"When I was undressing her she became consciously aware. The last thing she said was f -- -you.\"\n\nSkibicki said he sexually violated the woman's corpse before disposing of her body in a nearby outdoor garbage bin.\n\nSkibicki said about a month later he met Harris, whom he had known previously, outside Siloam Mission. He said she had been barred from the mission and invited her to his home. Skibicki said he filled the bathtub with water as Harris went outside for a smoke.\n\n\"I wasn't going to let her have that, but I was thinking... this is going to be her last smoke, so I let her enjoy that,\" Skibicki said.\n\nSkibicki said he tried to push Harris into the tub, and when she resisted, put her in a headlock.\n\n\"She kind of collapsed, with her head in the tub,\" he said. Harris fought back and Skibicki drowned her.\n\nHe said he had sex with Harris's corpse several times before disposing of her body in a garbage bin behind a nearby Midas Muffler shop.\n\nSkibicki said he dismembered Contois and the victim now known to be Myran with a combat knife. Asked by investigators if he had any butchering or hunting experience and what knowledge he had of how to cut up bodies, Skibicki laughed and said: \"Instinct.\"\n\n\"I started to choke her. I thought she was dead, but she wasn't ... When I was undressing her she became consciously aware. The last thing she said was f -- -you.\"\n\nHe said he met Myran in a back lane between the Salvation Army and Siloam Mission and invited her to his place.\n\nSkibicki said he told the woman he was interested in a relationship, but she \"was just using me for a place to stay.\"\n\nHe said they were having sex and she \"didn't let me finish\" when he \"started to get a little rough with her.\"\n\nWhen Myran tried to leave, he strangled her. He admitted sexually violating her corpse several times.\n\nSkibicki said he realized he would be unable to lift Myran's body into a garbage bin.\n\n\"That was the first time I cut up a body,\" he said.\n\nOver 12 hours, Skibicki dismembered Myran in a bathtub full of water and Pine-Sol.\n\n\"It took a long time to cut the body into pieces,\" he said, later adding he couldn't remember where he disposed of her remains.\n\nSkibicki said he met Contois for the first time on a bus a couple of months before her death, and she began staying at his place. She left for a time and when she returned said she loved Skibicki, he said.\n\n\"I knew she was just bullshitting me to get what she wanted. That's probably one of the reasons I did what I did, because I saw through it,\" he said.\n\nSkibicki said he and Contois were having sex when she wanted him to stop and they started fighting.\n\n\"I put her in a chokehold... choked her to death.\"\n\nAgain, Skibicki sexually violated Contois after killing her, and then put her body in a bathtub and dismembered her.\n\nSkibicki described the murders as \"mercy killings\" and said he was \"directed by God,\" telling investigators he was driven by a white supremacist ideology and that he didn't believe \"that races are meant to be forced to live together.\"\n\n\"I believe now it was (the victims') time,\" he said. \"I believe... extreme desperate measures need to be taken for the survival of my people.\"\n\n\"I believe this was God calling me,\" he said. \"It was something I decided to do because I thought I was right.\"\n\nSkibicki said he likely would have killed more women if he hadn't been caught. Police arrested him May 18, 2022 in the death of Contois. He was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Harris, Myran and Buffalo Woman on Dec. 1, 2022.\n\n\"I was pretty sure I could get away with it, but I got sloppy,\" Skibicki said.\n\n\"I wanted to (stop), but I don't think I could have.\"\n\nSkibicki said he got the idea to dispose the victims' remains in the garbage after reading about the case of Shawn Lamb and timed the disposal to coincide with scheduled garbage pick-ups.\n\nLamb was sentenced in 2013 to 20 years in prison for the killings of Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and 18-year-old Lorna Blacksmith.\n\nSkibicki described other steps he took to avoid detection, including ensuring no one knew the victims had been with him and targeting women with no social media presence.\n\nSkibicki told police he aborted plans to kill at least one woman because of her social media footprint.\n\nThe trial resumes Thursday with testimony from police officers who are expected to tell court about evidence seized from Skibicki's home and other locations.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But Mr. Skibicki's defence attorneys are arguing he was not criminally responsible for the murders because of mental illness.\n\nOn Wednesday, in opening statements for the trial before Court of King's Bench Justice Glenn Joyal, the Crown contended that Mr. Skibicki murdered the women in a calculated way. The prosecution believes he should be found criminally responsible.\n\nTimeline of slayings of four women in Winnipeg, demands to search a landfill for remains\n\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere said Mr. Skibicki preyed on the victims from shelters for vulnerable people, invited them back to his home where he assaulted them, often sexually, then killed them before engaging in further sexual acts on their bodies before disposing them \"as though they were garbage.\"\n\nMr. Skibicki, she added, carefully thought out schemes about what he intended to do and carried out those violent plans successfully. \"This case is about a man's hate-filled and cruel acts perpetrated against four vulnerable Indigenous women,\" Ms. Lagimodiere said.\n\nThe Crown then presented its first pieces of evidence in court after its opening argument in the morning. The court is scheduled to continue hearing the case on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAccording to a statement of facts agreed to by both the Crown and the defence, a man named John Kinal called police at 5:24 a.m. on May 16, 2022, after finding a human head in a bag in a garbage bin outside an apartment building in Winnipeg's East Kildonan residential community. This turned out to be the remains of Ms. Contois.\n\nProsecutors played the audio recording of Mr. Kinal's call with a 911 dispatcher. He said he knew he needed to call the police, but was fearful that the person who disposed of the bag might return. He was also worried about a garbage truck arriving to empty the bin.\n\nPolice arrested Mr. Skibicki with the help of tactical units the next day.\n\nDuring the lengthy interrogation which lasted until May 18, Mr. Skibicki admitted to killing three other women.\n\nIn the first hour of the video shown to court, Mr. Skibicki began to admit to his crimes after initially asking the investigators for a priest to confess his \"sins.\" He said he strangled, choked and drowned four women in his apartment.\n\nWinnipeg detective sergeant Greg Allan, who interrogated Mr. Skibicki, is expected to testify later on Wednesday.\n\nBefore the Crown started to present the evidence, Justice Joyal commenced the hearing by formally discharging the 12-member jury that was selected for the trial late last month. The court dismissed the jurors because both the Crown and defence agreed to a judge-alone trial, given the complicated nature of ascertaining a not-criminally-responsible verdict in Mr. Skibicki's case.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Nations in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_King's_Bench_(England)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Court of King's Bench (England)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elder (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrogation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interrogation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(religion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confession (religion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Joyal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Joyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kildonan,_Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Kildonan, Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Kildonan, Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/JX4I224AVRC2JLF676IIBXZ4T4.jpg?auth=971537629ee8ff5fba3ef72a7684af533f16b9e80393e7c83f74f955bd205311&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550514", "eventUri": "eng-9550514", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 2562, "textEnd": 2568}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 1967, "textEnd": 1973}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Jan de Vries, who was part of the police search team, testified they found bloodstains in Skibicki's bathroom belonging to one of the victims, Rebecca Contois.\n\nSome stains were visible while others were found using a spray that makes stains fluorescent when used with a black light, he said.\n\n\"The bathtub was very fluorescent,\" said de Vries. \"So was the floor, the walls and on the exterior side of the door.\"\n\nHe said the bloodstains found in the bathtub covered the entire area, which had likely been emptied and rinsed at some point.\n\nSkibicki is charged with first-degree murder for the 2022 killings of Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe has confessed to the slayings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nThe Crown said the killings were racially motivated, with Skibicki a self-proclaimed white supremacist and the four victims Indigenous.\n\nProsecutors said Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters, assaulted them, killed them and disposed of their bodies in garbage bins.\n\nGRAPHIC WARNING: The following details may disturb some readers.\n\nThe partial remains of Contois were found in multiple dumpsters in Skibicki's neighbourhood, as well as in a local landfill.\n\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere has told court Skibicki assaulted 24-year-old Contois during sex.

This led police to section off an area at the Brady Road landfill, where they ultimately found the woman's torso, said de Vries.\n\nDe Vries said that in Skibicki's suite, police found a jacket and tuque belonging to Harris and Myran's earrings and baseball cap. DNA belonging to both women was also found, as was Myran's blood on the blade of a combat-style knife.\n\nThe remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill.\n\nInvestigators have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nSkibicki told police he sold Buffalo Woman's jacket online. Police later located the reversible Baby Phat jacket, and an unidentified woman's DNA profile was found.\n\nDe Vries testified there have been substantial but unsuccessful efforts to identify that DNA.\n\nCourt heard DNA evidence from 16 females was found in the apartment and in a garbage bin in the area. Nine of those samples were unidentified.\n\nLagimodiere told reporters outside court that the Crown doesn't believe at this time there are more victims in the case.\n\nOne identified DNA sample belonged to a missing woman. Ashlee Shingoose was last seen in downtown Winnipeg in March 2022.\n\nShingoose's family told local media last year that they were asked to provide a DNA sample to police but it didn't come back as a match to Buffalo Woman.\n\nPolice said in an email Thursday that Shingoose is still considered missing.\n\nThe federal government has a support line for those affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: 1-844-413-6649.

Jan de Vries, who was part of the police search team, testified they found bloodstains in Skibicki's bathroom belonging to one of the victims, Rebecca Contois.\n\nSome stains were visible while others were found using a spray that makes stains fluorescent when used with a black light, he said.\n\n\"The bathtub was very fluorescent,\" said de Vries. \"So was the floor, the walls and on the exterior side of the door.\"\n\nHe said the bloodstains found in the bathtub covered the entire area, which had likely been emptied and rinsed at some point.\n\nThe remains of Contois were found in at least two different dumpsters in Skibicki's neighbourhood, as well as in a local landfill.\n\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere has told court Skibicki assaulted Contois when the 24-year-old told him to get off of her during sex. He then choked her, smothered her with a pillow and dismembered her in a bathtub.\n\nPolice say they found several of her belongings in a garbage bin in that same neighbourhood.\n\nSurveillance video showing an individual emptying bags taken from a black duffle bag into a garbage bin in the area.\n\nWhen officers went to search the bin, it had already been emptied. This led police to section off an area at the Brady Road landfill, where they ultimately found the woman's torso, said de Vries.\n\nSkibicki is on trial charged with first-degree murder for the killings, which occurred in early 2022.\n\nSkibicki also killed Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe has confessed to the killings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nThe Crown said the killings were racially motivated, with Skibicki a self-proclaimed white supremacist and the four victims Indigenous.\n\nThe Crown says Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters, assaulted them, killed them and disposed of their bodies in garbage bins.\n\nDe Vries said that in Skibicki's suite they found a jacket and toque belonging to Harris and Myran's earrings and baseball cap.\n\nCourt has also heard DNA evidence was found belonging to Harris, Myran, and Contois.\n\nThe remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill.\n\nInvestigators have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nAfter arresting Skibicki, officers located a reversible jacket believed to belong to Buffalo Woman and tested it for DNA. Skibicki told police he had sold the jacket online.\n\nPolice were able to locate an unidentified female's DNA profile on the jacket. De Vries said there have been substantial but unsuccessful efforts to identify that DNA.\n\nCourt heard police located DNA evidence from 14 different females in Skibicki's home and garbage bins in the area. Nine of those samples belong to unidentified women.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathtub", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bathtub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fluorescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blacklight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffel_bag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duffel bag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismemberment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dismemberment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dumpster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insanity defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_shelter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeless shelter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp.org/817b292a16a2d47791f347a04031746e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550514", "eventUri": "eng-9550514", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Their remains have yet to be found.\n\nThe location of the remains of the fourth victim - Buffalo Woman - is unknown.\n\nCrown prosecutors have agreed the trial, which was originally scheduled to be before a jury, can be heard by a judge alone.\n\nAn earlier request by Jeremy Skibicki's lawyers to not have a jury was initially denied, but on Monday the trial judge accepted their request after the defence said it was now seeking a not criminally responsible verdict.\n\nJurors who had already been selected in late April to hear the case are expected to be officially dismissed on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue through early June.\n\nExperts say the trial's focus will likely shift given the suspect's not guilty plea on the basis of mental illness.\n\nBrandon Trask, a law professor at the University of Manitoba, told the BBC on Wednesday that typically, murder trials are about proving the accused's guilt. In this case, the onus will be on the defence to prove that the suspect suffers from \"a disease of the mind that rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature of his actions\".\n\n\"That's very much an uphill battle for the defence in this case, where you've got multiple victims spread out over a period of time,\" Mr Trask said.\n\nIf the suspect is successful in proving he is not criminally responsible, he would spend time in a forensic hospital setting rather than behind bars, and would be subject to annual hearings that would determine the level of freedoms that can be afforded to him moving forward.\n\nThe killings of the four women sparked an outcry in Canada, where a disproportionate number of indigenous women and girls are murdered or go missing.\n\nIn 2014, the federal statistics agency reported that indigenous women are six times more likely to be the victim of a homicide than non-indigenous women.\n\nThe case has also remained in the news as the families of the victims have fought to pressure the government to authorise and pay for the search the Prairie Green landfill, where the remains of Ms Myran and Ms Harris are believed to be.\n\nInitially, the provincial Manitoba government refused, citing the challenges of finding the remains, the cost, and concerns for worker safety given the presence of hazardous chemicals at the site.\n\nBut the province shifted course after a change in government saw the election of Premier Wab Kinew, who is indigenous.\n\nA search will likely start later this year after the province and Ottawa set aside a combined C$40m ($29m; \u00a323.3m) in funding.\n\nThe news was welcomed by Cambria Harris, Ms Harris' daughter, who has been advocating for the search since 2022.\n\n\"It's about showing our indigenous women, our indigenous people, that we're worth it,\" Ms Harris told CBC news recently.\n\n\"That we're valued, that we're loved and we're more than worth searching for.\"", "source":

Jan de Vries, who was part of the police search team, testified they found bloodstains in Skibicki's bathroom belonging to one of the victims, Rebecca Contois.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSome stains were visible while others were found using a spray that makes stains fluorescent when used with a black light, he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The bathtub was very fluorescent,\" said de Vries. \"So was the floor, the walls and on the exterior side of the door.\"\n\nHe said the bloodstains found in the bathtub covered the entire area, which had likely been emptied and rinsed at some point.\n\nSkibicki is charged with first-degree murder for the 2022 killings of Contois, Morgan Harris, Marcedes Myran and an unidentified woman Indigenous leaders have named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman.\n\nHe has confessed to the slayings, but his lawyers are arguing that he's not criminally responsible due to mental illness.\n\nThe Crown said the killings were racially motivated, with Skibicki a self-proclaimed white supremacist and the four victims Indigenous.\n\nProsecutors said Skibicki preyed on the vulnerable women at homeless shelters, assaulted them, killed them and disposed of their bodies in garbage bins.\n\nGRAPHIC WARNING: The following details may disturb some readers.\n\nThe partial remains of Contois were found in multiple dumpsters in Skibicki's neighbourhood, as well as in a local landfill.\n\nCrown prosecutor Renee Lagimodiere has told court Skibicki assaulted 24-year-old Contois during sex. He then choked her, smothered her with a pillow and dismembered her in the tub.\n\nImages from surveillance video presented in court show a person emptying bags into a bin in the neighbourhood.\n\nCourt heard that when officers went to search the bin, it had already been emptied. This led police to section off an area at the Brady Road landfill, where they ultimately found the woman's torso, said de Vries.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDe Vries said that in Skibicki's suite, police found a jacket and tuque belonging to Harris and Myran's earrings and baseball cap. DNA belonging to both women was also found, as was Myran's blood on the blade of a combat-style knife.\n\nThe remains of Harris and Myran are believed to be in a different landfill.\n\nInvestigators have said it's not known where the remains of Buffalo Woman are located.\n\nSkibicki told police he sold Buffalo Woman's jacket online. Police later located the reversible Baby Phat jacket, and an unidentified woman's DNA profile was found.\n\nDe Vries testified there have been substantial but unsuccessful efforts to identify that DNA.\n\nCourt heard DNA evidence from 16 females was found in the apartment and in a garbage bin in the area. Nine of those samples were unidentified.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nLagimodiere told reporters outside court that the Crown doesn't believe at this time there are more victims in the case.\n\nOne identified DNA sample belonged to a missing woman. Ashlee Shingoose was last seen in downtown Winnipeg in March 2022.\n\nShingoose's family told local media last year that they were asked to provide a DNA sample to police but it didn't come back as a match to Buffalo Woman.\n\nPolice said in an email Thursday that Shingoose is still considered missing.\n\nThe federal government has a support line for those affected by the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: 1-844-413-6649. The Hope for Wellness Helpline, with support in Cree, Ojibway and Inuktitut, is also available to all Indigenous people in Canada: 1-855-242-3310.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first

But during the late-stage admission in court, his attorneys said they want him to be found not criminally responsible for the first-degree murders.\n\nResearchers, legal scholars and lawyers observing the case believe this relatively rare defence for Mr. Skibicki - commonly referred to as NCR - is expected to change the kind of evidence shown in court about the women's deaths in 2022.\n\nBefore an NCR verdict is established by a court, an accused person must prove to be suffering from a mental disorder or some other incapacitation during the offence, preventing their ability to form the intent required to commit a crime.\n\n\"Lawyers are very reticent to raise the NCR defence unless they have a degree of confidence,\" said Saul Simmonds, founder of the leading Winnipeg-based firm Simmonds and Associates, in an interview.\n\nTimeline of slayings of four women in Winnipeg, demands to search a landfill for remains\n\nA criminal defence lawyer since 1981, Mr. Simmonds has represented clients across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Among the many trials he has worked on, the NCR defence stands out as a complicated test of the Canadian justice system, he said.\n\nAny case with such a defence would need to pass the high bar of presenting psychiatric evidence that directly shows an accused person's state of mind at the time of the offence, he added.\n\n\"There has to be significant evidence to prove that someone is not criminally responsible,\" Mr. Simmonds said. \"It's not just whether or not you are mentally ill. It's whether or not you understood the consequences of what you did at the time of the offence. Are you morally culpable?\"\n\nPolice arrested Mr. Skibicki in May, 2022, after Ms. Contois's partial remains were found in a garbage bin outside an apartment building in Winnipeg. More remains were later discovered at the separate Brady Road landfill in the southern outskirts of the city. She was a band member of Crane River First Nation.\n\nIn spring of that year, Ms. Harris and Ms. Myran, both from Long Plain First Nation, were killed before their bodies were dumped at Prairie Green landfill, north of the city, police said.\n\nPolice have not shared information about the whereabouts of Buffalo Woman's remains.\n\nBrandon Trask, an assistant professor of law at the University of Manitoba, said the NCR defence will likely shift the onus of proof away from the prosecution.\n\n\"There is a presumption in the Criminal Code that everybody is not suffering from a mental disorder so as to relieve them from criminal liability,\" said Prof. Trask, who has been involved with hundreds of cases as a Crown prosecutor in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n\"We may see some pieces of evidence no longer presented in court now that the Crown does not need to prove that Mr. Skibicki committed the killings,\" he said. \"But in a case where you've got multiple killings, it is quite a challenge for the defence to show that NCR applied to every single act, so we are definitely still going to see a significant amount of evidence to that end from the defence.\"\n\nMr. Simmonds said the evidence collection also changes with an NCR defence. \"You're not just looking at how a psychiatrist evaluates a person months after the event, you are also seeing what happened months before it,\" he said. \"Did you seek mental-health help? Because that makes this a different situation than for someone who hadn't.\"\n\nKelly Gorkoff, an associate professor and chair of the criminal justice department at the University of Winnipeg, said there has been an improvement in how society is viewing mental health, but that isn't necessarily reflected in the courts.\n\n\"It's not that justice doesn't need to be served for these women,\" she said. \"But we need to rethink how that should happen. What is the right way to hold somebody responsible for this? Is it only retribution?\"\n\nThese complications are why courts often prefer to have both the Crown and defence agree to an NCR verdict, Mr. Simmonds said.\n\nCourt of King's Bench Justice Glenn Joyal is scheduled on Wednesday to dismiss the 12-member jury selected for the trial late last month after both sides agreed to a judge-alone trial. Opening statements are also expected that day.\n\nMr. Skibicki's lawyers have received about 10 terabytes of information as part of the prosecution's disclosure process. That includes videos and photographs, according to defence attorney Leonard Tailleur.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [],

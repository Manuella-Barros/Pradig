The owner of the Dalry Bike Depot in Edinburgh was alerted to the robbery at around 5am on Saturday. He says the window was caved in and a white bike was dumped outside while another was stole. After checking nearby CCTV, he claims the suspect was captured on video. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, George said: \"Around 5am on Wednesday, June 5, I had an alarm notification on my phone for the store. I rushed over and arrived within a matter of minutes. I was greeted with a hole in through the window, glass everywhere, and a white bicycle abandoned in front of the shop. \"I checked around and had noticed that a customer's bike was stolen. I promptly phoned the police, and officers arrived within a few hours and took statements as well as taking samples from the window. It is our theory that they hadn't fully entered the property, but smashed a hole in the middle and dragged a bike through it that was hung up awaiting collection after repair. \"After checking other local businesses CCTV we have seen the suspect at 4.57am riding along Dalry road toward our store on the white bike wearing a North Face coat and black balaclava. I received the alarm notification at 5.04am, and arrived at 5.11am.\" George is asking anyone with information to get in touch or to contact the police. He added: \"We urge anyone with any information on the suspect and the whereabouts of the stolen bike to contact us or the police on 101. The bike is a Mondraker Dune RR, 2016 Model, in a red/orange colour with Lime green graphics. The customer has been notified and has been very understanding about the incident.\" Talking about the effect the theft has had on him and the store, George said: \"It isn't just the cost of the bike that has been stolen, but it is the cost of the window, the hours of admin and paperwork, the stress and anxiety it has caused us. The community has been fantastic in supporting us and offering help. Ourselves and Lucky Spoke Tattoo will continue to operate in a slightly reduced capacity, but please do get in touch with any queries.\" A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \"Around 5.20am on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, we were called to a report of a break-in and the theft of a bicycle from a premises in Caledonian Place, Edinburgh Enquiries are ongoing.\" Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "summary": "The owner of the Dalry Bike Depot in Edinburgh was alerted at around 5am on Saturday to the robbery.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/balaclava-clad-thug-caught-cctv-32988690", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32988772.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screenshot-2024-06-08-at-11270.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:58:02", "author": "Katie Williams,Ryan Carroll", "authors": ["Katie Williams", "Ryan Carroll"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.55}

The overseeing Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement on Sunday, explained that the development had been communicated in an operational feedback to the Kaduna State Government. Aruwan said the troops embarked on operations to clear the Maro-Enugu axis spanning Kachia and Kajuru Local Government when they engaged the bandits in a gun duel. He further explained, \"At Dantarau community, the troops made contact with bandits and after a sharp exchange, five of the criminals were neutralized.\" The statement also stated that the troops also recovered two AK-47 rifles, one locally fabricated sub-machine gun, nine AK-47 magazines, 250 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, two motorcycles and two handheld radio sets. Aruwan further disclosed that the Air Component of Operation Whirl Punch successfully hit bandits camps in Sabon Birnin Daji general area of Igabi Local Government Area. He explained that credible human intelligence sources confirmed the successful operation resulting in several bandits taken out during the mission. Some of the bandits sustained injuries and are reported to be lurking around the general area in need of medical support. According to Aruwan, locals in the general area are warned to desist from providing medical support to questionable individuals without recourse to the nearest security agencies and advised citizens to report to the 24 Operations Room on the numbers: 09034000060, 08170189999.

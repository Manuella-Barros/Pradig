Those employees, Thompson said, will be eligible for severance packages.\n\nSince his appointment last year, Thompson has been candid about the challenges facing CNN, stressing to staffers that swift and dramatic steps are necessary to reorient the television-focused news organization for a digital future.\n\nLike other legacy media companies, CNN has for its four-decade history relied heavily on carriage fees from the traditional cable news bundle, a declining business that has been upended by the advent of streaming services such as Netflix. While the company is still profitable to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, pivoting the network's business away from the contracting cable industry, which provides the bulk of CNN's revenue, to position it for the future will be an enormously difficult challenge.\n\n\"Turning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time,\" Thompson said in his memo to staff. \"Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\"\n\nThompson's announcement that he intends to build a digital subscription business generating more than a billion dollars in revenue represents a cornerstone of his strategy to \"future-proof\" CNN. A direct-to-consumer subscription product has long been seen by CNN's leaders as the answer to shrinking revenues brought on by the decline of linear television.\n\nFormer management launched CNN+, a subscription streaming service that was quickly shuttered when CNN's one-time parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The siloed news streaming service did not fit into Warner Bros. Discovery's business strategy, which called for building a super-streamer resembling the cable news bundle. CNN now boasts a much more budget-friendly streaming service, CNN Max, that lives alongside other brands like HBO inside its parent company's streaming service Max.\n\nThompson, who was light on specifics while announcing his plans for a digital subscription business, said CNN will create \"products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences.\" He said the first product will launch by the end of 2024.\n\nThompson, who previously served as chief executive of The New York Times, had pushed to expand the newspaper's products beyond core news, acquiring review website The Wirecutter and launching the outlet's cooking vertical, among other moves.\n\n\"We want to build on CNN.com's reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency - how long our users spend with us and how often they return - by improving the quality of the product experience and giving users powerful reasons to come back to us more often,\" Thompson said in his memo.\n\nAs he works to modernize CNN's business, Thompson unveiled plans to embrace artificial intelligence tools, aiming to \"reclaim the 'pioneering spirit' Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future.\"\n\nThompson said CNN will make a \"strategic push\" into AI to \"determine how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively.\"\n\nHis transformative measures will also include a dramatic overhaul of CNN's newsroom, which has been largely split into three divisions: US television, international television and digital. Thompson said the structural changes he is implementing will unify the three branches under one roof.\n\nCNN will also further embrace a \"follow the sun\" model, in which news stories are overseen at any given time by the company's bureaus across the world. As part of that effort, Thompson said CNN's Hong Kong bureau will see an \"expanded role\" and that the organization would \"make greater use\" of its bureaus in London and Los Angeles.\n\n\"This will streamline workflows across newsgathering and place editorial direction closer to the story,\" Thompson explained. \"It will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn.\"\n\nWhile Thompson primarily focused on digital offerings, he also announced plans to breathe new life into CNN's television programming. Thompson said that Charlie Moore, the longtime \"Anderson Cooper 360\" executive producer who was recently promoted to vice president of prime time programming, will \"find ways to further develop and strengthen\" the network's television offerings. Thompson further announced the creation of a \"TV Futures Lab\" that will \"not only develop and manage streaming and (video on demand) programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments.\"\n\nThe changes come after years of strategy shifts and cuts at the pioneering cable news network. After longtime leader Jeff Zucker abruptly left the company in early 2022, the company has been without clear direction.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery then appointed veteran television producer Chris Licht to replace Zucker. Licht was forced to lay off hundreds of staffers early in the job and never articulated a clear path for CNN to move into the digital future. Compounding his lack of vision, Licht's brief one-year tenure was marked by a series of severe missteps.\n\nThompson, who is widely credited for revitalizing The Times, was appointed CNN chief executive last summer, after Licht's tumultuous run in the job. Since then, Thompson has spoken consistently about the need to transform CNN's business but has largely avoided offering specifics. Thompson's announcement Wednesday indicates he is now ready to execute on a more concrete plan.\n\nWhether Thompson can successfully create a billion-dollar digital news business at CNN remains to be seen. Time is also of the essence for Thompson as the cable news business continues to collapse. At The Times, the newspaper announced earlier this year that its digital subscription business will earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue, more than a decade after Thompson had initially taken the helm and started to implement changes there.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional context and developments.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_darcy@aol.com", "name": "Oliver Darcy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson_(media_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Thompson (media executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States cable news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Discovery-backed news outlet will launch a new subscription product on CNN.com before the end of the year, according to a new memo from CNN Chairman and CEO Mark Thompson, and debut two new free ad-supported digital offerings, one based on CNN's original series and productions, and another based on its Spanish-language service.\n\n\"We plan to take the journalistic firepower, user-experience and commercial potential of CNN Digital to the next level with strategic commitment, significant fresh investment, an injection of specialist expertise and plenty of creativity and experimentation,'\" said Thompson, who didn't offer granular details about the new subscription concept. \"We will develop new digital products with a special focus on digital experiences worth paying for.\"\n\nThe memo, like similar ones the news leader has issued in the recent past, was broad and, in some cases, vague. But it reveals his continued efforts to push CNN, a mainstay of traditional television into a new age even as news junkies increasingly turn to non-traditional video sources for both quick-hit information and in-depth reportage. The maneuver is crucial. Unlike many of its rivals, CNN has yet to develop a sustainable digital-video product. And while it experiments, competitors like NBC News and CBS News have launched content offerings that can be found everywhere from Amazon's Fire portal to YouTube.\n\nIn some ways, the new concepts echo one of CNN's biggest recent initiatives: The company in 2022 debuted CNN+, a subscription-based streaming hub that executives said represented the best way to capture die-hard viewers with a mix of lifestyle and news programming that relied on personalities including Wolf Blitzer, Kate Bolduan and Kasie Hunt. Within a month of its launch, the service was shut down by CNN's new parent corporation.\n\nThe new product seems to be narrower in scope -- it will be offered via CNN's popular website, not as a separate streaming hub -- and could also serve as a trial balloon. Thompson laid out a vision of \"creating a growing stable of 'news you can use' offerings anchored by lifestyle and features areas where CNN already has brand permission and is competitively positioned to win. Such products offer multiple opportunities for monetization through sponsorship, advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription.\" He also noted that \"we are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength,:\" including \"consumer advice\" and health \"as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further.\"\n\nThompson, who joined CNN as its new leader in 2023 after logging stints at the BBC and New York Times Co., has vowed to push the journalism unit into new digital frontiers, a bet that he can help build new revenue as CNN's flagship cable network suffers from the defection of traditional TV watchers to streaming. CNN's subscriber base is projected to fall 5.6% to 66.3 million in 2024 -- an election year -- according to estimates from Kagan, a market-research unit of S&P Global Intelligence. According to Kagan, CNN ended 2023 with 70.3 million subscribers.\n\nTo accomplish his goals, Thompson said in his memo he will reorganize CNN's newsgathering structure and eliminate about 100 positions -- about 2.8% of CNN's employee base of 3,500. \"Our priority throughout this process will be to treat them and every other CNN colleague with the respect, dignity, and the support you all deserve, including severance packages, career counseling and assistance with job placement,\" he said.\n\nCNN will break down divisions between U.S.-based and international news teams, as well as those that may exist between digital, text and video production. \"Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost,\" Thompson said. \"We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another.\"\n\nThompson also laid out some goals for CNN's TV operations, where he has recently been willing to cut costs. In February, CNN eliminated its regular morning program, \"CNN This Morning\" in the belief that the production outlays required to compete with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and Fox News Channel's \"Fox & Friends,\" along with the usual array of broadcast news mainstays, were no longer worth the price. CNN also launched the short-form news program \"5 Things,\" which has been streaming on Warner's Max service, and will expand it to CNN.com\n\nBut that won't be enough. Viewership for CNN's current primetime lineup has sunk to some of the lowest levels in the network's history. Charlie Moore, a longtime producer for Anderson Cooper, has been assigned to \"find ways to further develop and strengthen our domestic primetime offering,\" Thompson said. In a bid to devise new programming concepts, CNN will launch a TV Futures Lab that is charged with developing and managing programming for Max, but also with devising ways \"to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments,\" Thompson said.\n\nCNN's top executive offered a nod to the original architect of the news company, noting he hoped current staffers could help \"reclaim the 'pioneering spirit' Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future.\" Turner, however, had what in hindsight appears to have been a much easier task of building something that had not previously existed. Thompson must try to preserve Turner's original product while launching many others top help CNN capture the full potential audience for its programming in a very complex environment.", "source":

Discovery-backed news outlet will launch a new subscription product on CNN.com before the end of the year, according to a new memo from CNN Chairman and CEO Mark Thompson, and debut two new free ad-supported digital offerings, one based on CNN's original series and productions, and another based on its Spanish-language service. The moves come amid an overhaul of CNN's newsroom that will result in the elimination of 100 positions.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nHow Low Can They Go? Big Media Stocks Hammered by Industry Headwinds and Hollywood's M&A Dilemma\n\nBoris Becker, Arnaud Tournant and Caroline Kluft Lead Paris Olympics 2024 Coverage for Warner Bros. Discovery Eurosport\n\nCould Max and Paramount+ Merge? Warner Bros. Discovery Open to Exploring Paramount Streaming Joint Venture\n\n\"We plan to take the journalistic firepower, user-experience and commercial potential of CNN Digital to the next level with strategic commitment, significant fresh investment, an injection of specialist expertise and plenty of creativity and experimentation,'\" said Thompson, who didn't offer granular details about the new subscription concept. \"We will develop new digital products with a special focus on digital experiences worth paying for.\"\n\nThe memo, like similar ones the news leader has issued in the recent past, was broad and, in some cases, vague. But it reveals his continued efforts to push CNN, a mainstay of traditional television into a new age even as news junkies increasingly turn to non-traditional video sources for both quick-hit information and in-depth reportage. The maneuver is crucial. Unlike many of its rivals, CNN has yet to develop a sustainable digital-video product. And while it experiments, competitors like NBC News and CBS News have launched content offerings that can be found everywhere from Amazon's Fire portal to YouTube.\n\nIn some ways, the new concepts echo one of CNN's biggest recent initiatives: The company in 2022 debuted CNN+, a subscription-based streaming hub that executives said represented the best way to capture die-hard viewers with a mix of lifestyle and news programming that relied on personalities including Wolf Blitzer, Kate Bolduan and Kasie Hunt. Within a month of its launch, the service was shut down by CNN's new parent corporation.\n\nThe new product seems to be narrower in scope -- it will be offered via CNN's popular website, not as a separate streaming hub -- and could also serve as a trial balloon. Thompson laid out a vision of \"creating a growing stable of 'news you can use' offerings anchored by lifestyle and features areas where CNN already has brand permission and is competitively positioned to win. Such products offer multiple opportunities for monetization through sponsorship, advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription.\" He also noted that \"we are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength,:\" including \"consumer advice\" and health \"as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further.\"\n\nThompson, who joined CNN as its new leader in 2023 after logging stints at the BBC and New York Times Co., has vowed to push the journalism unit into new digital frontiers, a bet that he can help build new revenue as CNN's flagship cable network suffers from the defection of traditional TV watchers to streaming. CNN's subscriber base is projected to fall 5.6% to 66.3 million in 2024 -- an election year -- according to estimates from Kagan, a market-research unit of S&P Global Intelligence. According to Kagan, CNN ended 2023 with 70.3 million subscribers.\n\nTo accomplish his goals, Thompson said in his memo he will reorganize CNN's newsgathering structure and eliminate about 100 positions -- about 2.8% of CNN's employee base of 3,500. \"Our priority throughout this process will be to treat them and every other CNN colleague with the respect, dignity, and the support you all deserve, including severance packages, career counseling and assistance with job placement,\" he said.\n\nCNN will break down divisions between U.S.-based and international news teams, as well as those that may exist between digital, text and video production. \"Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost,\" Thompson said. \"We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another.\"\n\nThompson also laid out some goals for CNN's TV operations, where he has recently been willing to cut costs. In February, CNN eliminated its regular morning program, \"CNN This Morning\" in the belief that the production outlays required to compete with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" and Fox News Channel's \"Fox & Friends,\" along with the usual array of broadcast news mainstays, were no longer worth the price. CNN also launched the short-form news program \"5 Things,\" which has been streaming on Warner's Max service, and will expand it to CNN.com\n\nBut that won't be enough. Viewership for CNN's current primetime lineup has sunk to some of the lowest levels in the network's history. Charlie Moore, a longtime producer for Anderson Cooper, has been assigned to \"find ways to further develop and strengthen our domestic primetime offering,\" Thompson said. In a bid to devise new programming concepts, CNN will launch a TV Futures Lab that is charged with developing and managing programming for Max, but also with devising ways \"to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments,\" Thompson said.\n\nCNN's top executive offered a nod to the original architect of the news company, noting he hoped current staffers could help \"reclaim the 'pioneering spirit' Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future.\" Turner, however, had what in hindsight appears to have been a much easier task of building something that had not previously existed. Thompson must try to preserve Turner's original product while launching many others top help CNN capture the full potential audience for its programming in a very complex environment.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nAwards Season Calendar (2024-2025): Key Dates and Timeline for Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG and More\n\nHere's Where To Buy Retro Arcade1Up Cabinets To Re-Live Your Childhood Online\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

He said they will look at how the company can safely use the tech to better serve its audience.\n\nThompson, a former executive at the BBC and The New York Times, helped the outlets increase the amount of subscribers significantly. When he joined CNN last year he said that the company's TV offerings \"can no longer define us,\" and that CNN was \"nowhere near ready for the future.\"\n\nCNN will be hoping to avoid another disaster like what transpired with the previous the launch of CNN+, a $100 million digital streaming service launched in 2022 which was shuttered only a month after it launched.\n\nStay informed!

He will host a town hall with staff later in the day to further elaborate on the plan.\n\n\"Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles,\" Thompson wrote. \"However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk.\"\n\nCNN last had significant layoffs in late 2022 under previous CEO Chris Licht. Those cuts included major reductions at the HLN channel as well as at CNN International, along with a reevaluation of its on-air contributor deals.\n\nHowever, he also noted that the company has created new roles that will help him and his team build out his digital ambitions.\n\nThompson was hired last year after Licht's ouster, reorganizing the company earlier this year to be more digital-centric.\n\nWhile the specifics around CNN's first subscription offering were not clear from the memo, Thompson did emphasize that rather than the text-based experience it currently leans on, CNN will focus more on video in digital going forward.\n\n\"More than anything the CNN brand stands for news brought to you in moving pictures and sound with an onscreen anchor or correspondent acting as a trusted guide,\" Thompson wrote. \"In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent. Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform - from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more - it is essential for CNN's future.\"\n\nTo that end, CNN will also be building out its free, ad-supported streaming business with two new offerings, one based on CNN Originals, and another based on CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.\n\nAnd with regard to artificial intelligence, Thompson writes that he wants to determine \"how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively.\"\n\nOn the TV front, Thompson wrote that \"as everyone knows, we're living through a revolution in both news and television consumption from which our domestic and international TV channels are certainly not immune. To me, the right response to this revolution is not despair but adaptation and innovation.\"\n\nHe announced the creation of a TV futures lab led by Eric Sherling, which \"will not only develop and manage streaming and VOD programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments.\"\n\nAnd Charlie Moore, who oversees primetime for CNN, will seek to \"further develop and strengthen\" the lineup, suggesting that changes will follow.\n\nPerhaps most notable for CNN staff (even if viewers may not notice immediately) is that CNN will reorganize its newsrooms to break down walls between CNN domestic and CNN International, as well as digital and TV, text-based and video.\n\n\"Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost,\" Thompson wrote. \"We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another. The new operating model for news is very different from how we work today, and we'll take the next few weeks to transition to the new state.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, America and the world turned their attention to a CNN studio in Atlanta. The programme we broadcast that night was one of the most consequential not just in our history but that of the whole of TV news. It was also a perfect example of everything CNN stands for. Fairness. Total professionalism. A commitment to be there for our audiences when it matters most and to live up to Ted Turner's founding mission for this great news company.\n\nFrom the day I joined CNN nine months ago, I've talked about the need to take this precious inheritance and future-proof it for a very different media future. Back in January I set out some big themes:\n\nToday is a key milestone in the transformation of CNN because, after months of work by literally hundreds of you, we're now able to set out in more detail how we plan to turn these themes into reality. In the sections below you'll read of plans to move from today to an integrated and significantly streamlined multimedia news operation; a bold new digital strategy which includes the launch before the end of the year of CNN.com's first direct-to-consumer subscription product; the creation of a TV Futures lab to develop formats and distribution opportunities for the linear news experience on digital platforms; plans to open up other new sources of revenue for CNN; and much else besides. Some of these plans will require investment and there will be new roles and opportunities in many areas. But we're also closing some posts and you'll read about those in this memo as well.\n\nTurning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time. Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\n\nA GLOBAL INTEGRATED MULTIMEDIA NEWS OPERATION\n\nCNN has historically had three separate newsrooms and multiple planning operations. We're moving today to a single global multimedia editorial operation to take on the challenges of our multi-platform, multi-product future.\n\nOne newsroom. We're merging the newsgathering and digital news teams that currently sit in US domestic and international news to create unified operations under a new Global News organization. These new integrated teams will report out the news, produce it and publish it with a minimum of friction and duplication. Domestic and international news desks will retain their domestic and international specialisms for now, but will work more closely together, and come together to share resources for big breaking stories. Those who previously worked as a digital news writer or editor, or news desk producer or editor, working in separate structures and performing often duplicative tasks, will join unified teams in the US and our main international hubs.\n\nThese hubs will have a single editorial head to lead news coverage from their geography. There are two work groups under this leadership - news reporting and news video. The news reporting teams will chase and publish stories whether in the form of digital stories, live stories, or traditional news alerts. The news video teams will capture and produce video stories increasingly in the spirit of capture once and produce/version for all platforms.\n\nThe news video team will chase down, originate, ingest and verify news video from all sources, whether that's on-the-ground video shot by our own journalists, social media video needing verification, video from agencies or affiliates or other sources. They will alert incoming video to the network for use on all platforms, TV and digital. Embedded within the news video team will be a group of digital video specialists, who will produce, edit, and publish video for digital platforms. The digital video specialists will report up to Alex MacCallum's organization but will work day-to-day alongside global news colleagues.The video team will also handle correspondents' live shots, liaise with TV and streaming shows to satisfy their requirements and handle any TV-specific package requirements.\n\nWe're also introducing the new role of \"story manager\" to run all editorial aspects of a story from beginning to publication/airing, improving editorial focus and long-term planning. This move to story-centric editorial support and management is a break from our current practice, which is to base editorial support on region or shift. We will assign story managers to all major stories and breaking news to manage the editorial execution and create more space to focus on day 2+ reporting. These leads will be placed in all major CNN bureaus around the world.\n\nAdditionally, the Row will be renamed \"CNN Factcheck\" and move under the Global News division as an integrated part of the reporting process, working with story managers from the start of the story lifecycle.\n\nTo ensure consistent, multiplatform coverage around the clock, we will supercharge CNN's\u202f\"Follow the Sun\"\u202fmodel with a new fully blended editorial structure across our hubs globally.\u202fThe new operating model will create an integrated newsgathering, text and video operation and place ownership of it in the hands of editorial hubs around the world.\n\nThis will streamline workflows across newsgathering and place editorial direction closer to the story. It will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn. The enhanced Follow the Sun model will also create an expanded role for CNN's Hong Kong hub in US overnight hours and make greater use of our operations in London and Los Angeles at additional hours across the day.\n\nWe've created a consistent, centralized planning process to maximize coverage opportunities across platforms.\u202fWe've introduced a new, unitary planning group for the whole of CNN to ensure we're planning stories and deployments with the needs of every part of the organization in mind. This will give us full visibility into everything from editorial and logistics to resources and budgets. It will also allow us to seamlessly coordinate our work, and understand what teams are doing, where and why.\u202fWe implemented this reform several weeks ago and have already seen significant positive results. With this change, we will be better positioned to capitalize on the news across platforms on a day to day, week to week and long-term basis.\n\nWe will streamline and standardize story-pitching. We know that stories are pitched in many different ways across teams and departments. By creating a clearly defined process and standardizing the information needed for every pitch, we will increase our ability to plan coverage, distribute it across multiple platforms, deliver better financial accountability, and eliminate some of the bottlenecks that currently slow us down.\n\nWe will embed expertise throughout the news operation, sharing skills and knowledge with multi-platform thinking to the fore. Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost. We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another. The new operating model for news is very different from how we work today, and we'll take the next few weeks to transition to the new state.\n\nBUILDING A BILLION DOLLAR PLUS DIGITAL BUSINESS\n\nCNN is already the largest branded digital news destination in the world. As well as amazing reach, we have many millions of deeply engaged loyal users. We plan to take the journalistic firepower, user-experience and commercial potential of CNN Digital to the next level with strategic commitment, significant fresh investment, an injection of specialist expertise and plenty of creativity and experimentation. We will develop new digital products with a special focus on digital experiences worth paying for.\n\nFirst, we will create best-in-class, subscription-ready products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences, starting with CNN.com's first subscription product launching before the end of 2024. We want to build on CNN.com's reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency - how long our users spend with us and how often they return - by improving the quality of the product experience and giving users powerful reasons to come back to us more often.\n\nWe will reimagine watching, reading and listening to our journalism in a holistic way that meets users' changing needs and expectations across the day and week. And we will work harder to tell them not just what's happening now, but what it means and what's likely to happen next.\n\nSecond, we will lean more heavily into video in our digital products. Our products today are primarily reading experiences. We have a huge stable of loyal users who love reading CNN and we will continue to meet their needs. But more than anything the CNN brand stands for news brought to you in moving pictures and sound with an onscreen anchor or correspondent acting as a trusted guide. In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent. Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform - from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more - it is essential for CNN's future. Migrating our video-based onscreen talent onto our branded platforms and the wider digital news ecosystem is potentially a key differentiator for us and will also be a focus for early experimentation and development.\n\nThird, we will aim to help our audience and customers \"live a better life,\" as Ted Turner promised on our founding day in 1980, by creating a growing stable of \"news you can use\" offerings anchored by lifestyle and features areas where CNN already has brand permission and is competitively positioned to win. Such products offer multiple opportunities for monetization through sponsorship, advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription. We are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength like consumer advice with CNN Underscored and health, as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further.\n\nFinally, we want to reclaim the \"pioneering spirit\" Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future. This effort will include a strategic push into AI to determine how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively. We will work closely with the new ideas labs being created in both the News and TV organizations. We will also aim to develop the sophistication of our data science to improve our understanding of our audiences, the quality and value of our digital advertising product and to drive our new digital subscription businesses to greater growth.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF TV AT CNN\n\nTed Turner founded CNN in 1980 as a TV news company, and TV will always be a central part of the CNN offering to America and the world. There are some stories and moments of drama which can only be fully appreciated and shared through live TV and streaming, as our presidential debate demonstrated so powerfully two weeks ago.\n\nBut as everyone knows, we're living through a revolution in both news and television consumption from which our domestic and international TV channels are certainly not immune. To me, the right response to this revolution is not despair but adaptation and innovation.\n\nOur experimentation with formats like 5 Things on Max and now CNN.com is a good recent example. A second is the changes we made at the start of this year to our US morning programming, introducing a line-up that's delivering better audience performance with lower production costs.\n\nWe're announcing today the creation of TV Futures Lab reporting to Eric Sherling. The lab will not only develop and manage streaming and VOD programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments. The lab will also partner with Digital Products and Services and other parts of CNN to develop and programme other experimental new services.\n\nIn his new role overseeing primetime, Charlie Moore is now actively working with Eric, our top EPs and other CNN colleagues to find ways to further develop and strengthen our domestic primetime offering. Our recent journalistic performance has been outstanding, from major election set-pieces to the Trump trial to a flurry of exclusive interviews and features. I've asked Eric and Charlie to explore how to build on that, increase audience competitiveness and also keep a close eye on production costs.\n\nWe're already modernizing other aspects of production, using technology to reduce expense, develop new revenue opportunities or to deliver a better service to our viewers. We are streamlining the way we produce the news ticker that appears on the bottom of the CNN screen, launching new FAST channels for CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and recently aired an experimental programme on the Trump Trial that used AI to turn the court transcript into an almost instant audio dialogue.\n\nWe've also reinvested in CNN Originals with outside partners and other long-form programming to strengthen weekend primetime, capitalize on non-news advertising revenue opportunities and to develop new franchises and formats.\n\nNEW SOURCES OF REVENUE: FROM FARMERS TO HUNTERS\n\nCNN is one of the world's most successful multi-platform global news brands, but we can't thrive as a company unless we find new sources of revenue to offset the structural pressures on legacy income streams. To address that challenge we're investing in new revenue, commercial and business affairs capabilities, drawing on pre-existing CNN expertise - including the highly entrepreneurial CNN International Commercial team - as well as top external talent. Our new revenue group is targeting the immediate near-term (0-6 months), medium-term (6-12 months) and over the long-term.\n\nWe've already achieved some significant wins this year, for instance engaging with multiple technology platforms on how best to partner around AI, and signing our first multi-million dollar licensing deal to unlock the value of our 44-year video archive.\n\nTo augment our core CNN Headlines FAST offering in the US and internationally, we will launch two more dedicated FAST channels later this year built around content from CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol to give us a suite of four FAST services to reaching digital streaming consumers. We believe that AVOD can be a growth driver for CNN alongside our established domestic and international core TV services.\n\nOther focus areas include: an assessment of the best way to monetize the value of CNN's digital audiences to advertisers; the development of CNN's features, lifestyle and other news-adjacent content to provide advertisers with more premium environments beyond hard news; working out how best to grow CNN's streaming and VOD footprints; and other long-term opportunities for growth.\n\nCULTURE AND COMMUNICATION\n\nOne of the successes of the transformation process was the creation of a \"Culture Committee\" made up of representatives from pretty much every department, bureau, and demographic across CNN. The committee not only drew on the insights in our recent Pulse Survey but connected with 350 people around the globe to identify areas of CNN's culture that themselves need change. Some of the news was good - optimism in CNN's future and belief in our mission is high almost everywhere despite the pressures our business is under. But there were tougher messages too - about bureaucracy, lack of opportunity, a culture that can sometimes stifle open debate, and management and communication that sometimes fall short of the mark.\n\nWe want to do everything we can to open this company's culture up to talent, opportunity and new ideas, and to foster an environment in which everyone feels valued and able to give their best. For that reason, I've accepted the recommendation of the committee to focus on five key priorities for cultural change, which they are actively working through proposed solutions and action around:\n\nOne CNN\n\nA new emphasis on collaboration and communication across platforms, regions and teams.\n\nLead with Transparency and Empower and Respect Our People\n\nClearer goals, more consistent feedback and career support, more transparent and candid communication, better training of management, greater accountability for leaders.\n\nInvest in Continuous Growth and Learning\n\nProvide more and better professional development opportunities, build on Mastercraft and create other new programmes to expand skills, wherever possible open vacant positions to competition and create more chances for employees to move laterally and widen their experience.\n\nActively Seek Out Diversity and Champion Inclusion and Community\n\nDiversity of background and thought will help CNN engage new audiences at home and abroad - so let's embrace DEI more fully and work to foster a CNN community based on fairness, openness and respect.\n\nValue the Full Employee\n\nBreaking news and a rapidly changing business can add up to a lot of pressure, so let's do a better job supporting colleagues, safeguarding well-being and mental health and recognizing the special challenges of working across geographies and cultures.\n\nIMPACT ON JOBS\n\nIn addition to some new posts and opportunities we have opened up at CNN, we're also announcing some staff reductions across the company today. Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles. However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk. The number of colleagues potentially impacted is around a hundred out of a workforce of more than 3,500, but I don't underestimate the impact this news is likely to have on everyone affected and want to thank them for everything they've done for this great news company over the years. Our priority throughout this process will be to treat them and every other CNN colleague with the respect, dignity, and the support you all deserve, including severance packages, career counseling and assistance with job placement.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThere's a lot to take in with these announcements, which is why my senior colleagues will share more information with you area by area and why we're holding a global Town Hall later today. Even if you can't join us live, do submit a remote question or come to another Town Hall in the coming months, or email me directly with questions or ideas.\n\nAs I said at the start, hundreds of you have been involved in developing the plans we're outlining today. I hope that, wherever you work at CNN, you'll feel that you can help ensure we implement them successfully,", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood

Those employees, Thompson said, will be eligible for severance packages.\n\nSince his appointment last year, Thompson has been candid about the challenges facing CNN, stressing to staffers that swift and dramatic steps are necessary to reorient the television-focused news organization for a digital future.\n\nLike other legacy media companies, CNN has for its four-decade history relied heavily on carriage fees from the traditional cable news bundle, a declining business that has been upended by the advent of streaming services such as Netflix. While the company is still profitable to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, pivoting the network's business away from the contracting cable industry, which provides the bulk of CNN's revenue, to position it for the future will be an enormously difficult challenge.\n\n\"Turning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time,\" Thompson said in his memo to staff. \"Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\"\n\n\"CNN last had significant layoffs in late 2022 under previous CEO Chris Licht.

The programme we broadcast that night was one of the most consequential not just in our history but that of the whole of TV news. It was also a perfect example of everything CNN stands for. Fairness. Total professionalism. A commitment to be there for our audiences when it matters most and to live up to Ted Turner's founding mission for this great news company.\n\nFrom the day I joined CNN nine months ago, I've talked about the need to take this precious inheritance and future-proof it for a very different media future. Back in January I set out some big themes:\n\nToday is a key milestone in the transformation of CNN because, after months of work by literally hundreds of you, we're now able to set out in more detail how we plan to turn these themes into reality. In the sections below you'll read of plans to move from today to an integrated and significantly streamlined multimedia news operation; a bold new digital strategy which includes the launch before the end of the year of CNN.com's first direct-to-consumer subscription product; the creation of a TV Futures lab to develop formats and distribution opportunities for the linear news experience on digital platforms; plans to open up other new sources of revenue for CNN; and much else besides. Some of these plans will require investment and there will be new roles and opportunities in many areas. But we're also closing some posts and you'll read about those in this memo as well.\n\nTurning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time. Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\n\nA GLOBAL INTEGRATED MULTIMEDIA NEWS OPERATION\n\nCNN has historically had three separate newsrooms and multiple planning operations. We're moving today to a single global multimedia editorial operation to take on the challenges of our multi-platform, multi-product future.\n\nOne newsroom. We're merging the newsgathering and digital news teams that currently sit in US domestic and international news to create unified operations under a new Global News organization. These new integrated teams will report out the news, produce it and publish it with a minimum of friction and duplication. Domestic and international news desks will retain their domestic and international specialisms for now, but will work more closely together, and come together to share resources for big breaking stories. Those who previously worked as a digital news writer or editor, or news desk producer or editor, working in separate structures and performing often duplicative tasks, will join unified teams in the US and our main international hubs.\n\nThese hubs will have a single editorial head to lead news coverage from their geography. There are two work groups under this leadership - news reporting and news video. The news reporting teams will chase and publish stories whether in the form of digital stories, live stories, or traditional news alerts. The news video teams will capture and produce video stories increasingly in the spirit of capture once and produce/version for all platforms.\n\nThe news video team will chase down, originate, ingest and verify news video from all sources, whether that's on-the-ground video shot by our own journalists, social media video needing verification, video from agencies or affiliates or other sources. They will alert incoming video to the network for use on all platforms, TV and digital. Embedded within the news video team will be a group of digital video specialists, who will produce, edit, and publish video for digital platforms. The digital video specialists will report up to Alex MacCallum's organization but will work day-to-day alongside global news colleagues.The video team will also handle correspondents' live shots, liaise with TV and streaming shows to satisfy their requirements and handle any TV-specific package requirements.\n\nWe're also introducing the new role of \"story manager\" to run all editorial aspects of a story from beginning to publication/airing, improving editorial focus and long-term planning. This move to story-centric editorial support and management is a break from our current practice, which is to base editorial support on region or shift. We will assign story managers to all major stories and breaking news to manage the editorial execution and create more space to focus on day 2+ reporting. These leads will be placed in all major CNN bureaus around the world.\n\nAdditionally, the Row will be renamed \"CNN Factcheck\" and move under the Global News division as an integrated part of the reporting process, working with story managers from the start of the story lifecycle.\n\nTo ensure consistent, multiplatform coverage around the clock, we will supercharge CNN's \"Follow the Sun\" model with a new fully blended editorial structure across our hubs globally. The new operating model will create an integrated newsgathering, text and video operation and place ownership of it in the hands of editorial hubs around the world.\n\nThis will streamline workflows across newsgathering and place editorial direction closer to the story. It will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn. The enhanced Follow the Sun model will also create an expanded role for CNN's Hong Kong hub in US overnight hours and make greater use of our operations in London and Los Angeles at additional hours across the day.\n\nWe've created a consistent, centralized planning process to maximize coverage opportunities across platforms. We've introduced a new, unitary planning group for the whole of CNN to ensure we're planning stories and deployments with the needs of every part of the organization in mind. This will give us full visibility into everything from editorial and logistics to resources and budgets. It will also allow us to seamlessly coordinate our work, and understand what teams are doing, where and why. We implemented this reform several weeks ago and have already seen significant positive results. With this change, we will be better positioned to capitalize on the news across platforms on a day to day, week to week and long-term basis.\n\nWe will streamline and standardize story-pitching. We know that stories are pitched in many different ways across teams and departments. By creating a clearly defined process and standardizing the information needed for every pitch, we will increase our ability to plan coverage, distribute it across multiple platforms, deliver better financial accountability, and eliminate some of the bottlenecks that currently slow us down.\n\nWe will embed expertise throughout the news operation, sharing skills and knowledge with multi-platform thinking to the fore. Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost. We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another. The new operating model for news is very different from how we work today, and we'll take the next few weeks to transition to the new state.\n\nBUILDING A BILLION DOLLAR PLUS DIGITAL BUSINESS\n\nCNN is already the largest branded digital news destination in the world. As well as amazing reach, we have many millions of deeply engaged loyal users. We plan to take the journalistic firepower, user-experience and commercial potential of CNN Digital to the next level with strategic commitment, significant fresh investment, an injection of specialist expertise and plenty of creativity and experimentation. We will develop new digital products with a special focus on digital experiences worth paying for.\n\nFirst, we will create best-in-class, subscription-ready products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences, starting with CNN.com's first subscription product launching before the end of 2024. We want to build on CNN.com's reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency - how long our users spend with us and how often they return - by improving the quality of the product experience and giving users powerful reasons to come back to us more often.\n\nWe will reimagine watching, reading and listening to our journalism in a holistic way that meets users' changing needs and expectations across the day and week. And we will work harder to tell them not just what's happening now, but what it means and what's likely to happen next.\n\nSecond, we will lean more heavily into video in our digital products. Our products today are primarily reading experiences. We have a huge stable of loyal users who love reading CNN and we will continue to meet their needs. But more than anything the CNN brand stands for news brought to you in moving pictures and sound with an onscreen anchor or correspondent acting as a trusted guide. In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent. Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform - from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more - it is essential for CNN's future. Migrating our video-based onscreen talent onto our branded platforms and the wider digital news ecosystem is potentially a key differentiator for us and will also be a focus for early experimentation and development.\n\nThird, we will aim to help our audience and customers \"live a better life,\" as Ted Turner promised on our founding day in 1980, by creating a growing stable of \"news you can use\" offerings anchored by lifestyle and features areas where CNN already has brand permission and is competitively positioned to win. Such products offer multiple opportunities for monetization through sponsorship, advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription. We are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength like consumer advice with CNN Underscored and health, as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further.\n\nFinally, we want to reclaim the \"pioneering spirit\" Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future. This effort will include a strategic push into AI to determine how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively. We will work closely with the new ideas labs being created in both the News and TV organizations. We will also aim to develop the sophistication of our data science to improve our understanding of our audiences, the quality and value of our digital advertising product and to drive our new digital subscription businesses to greater growth.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF TV AT CNN\n\nTed Turner founded CNN in 1980 as a TV news company, and TV will always be a central part of the CNN offering to America and the world. There are some stories and moments of drama which can only be fully appreciated and shared through live TV and streaming, as our presidential debate demonstrated so powerfully two weeks ago.\n\nBut as everyone knows, we're living through a revolution in both news and television consumption from which our domestic and international TV channels are certainly not immune. To me, the right response to this revolution is not despair but adaptation and innovation.\n\nOur experimentation with formats like 5 Things on Max and now CNN.com is a good recent example. A second is the changes we made at the start of this year to our US morning programming, introducing a line-up that's delivering better audience performance with lower production costs.\n\nWe're announcing today the creation of TV Futures Lab reporting to Eric Sherling. The lab will not only develop and manage streaming and VOD programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments. The lab will also partner with Digital Products and Services and other parts of CNN to develop and programme other experimental new services.\n\nIn his new role overseeing primetime, Charlie Moore is now actively working with Eric, our top EPs and other CNN colleagues to find ways to further develop and strengthen our domestic primetime offering. Our recent journalistic performance has been outstanding, from major election set-pieces to the Trump trial to a flurry of exclusive interviews and features. I've asked Eric and Charlie to explore how to build on that, increase audience competitiveness and also keep a close eye on production costs.\n\nWe're already modernizing other aspects of production, using technology to reduce expense, develop new revenue opportunities or to deliver a better service to our viewers. We are streamlining the way we produce the news ticker that appears on the bottom of the CNN screen, launching new FAST channels for CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and recently aired an experimental programme on the Trump Trial that used AI to turn the court transcript into an almost instant audio dialogue.\n\nWe've also reinvested in CNN Originals with outside partners and other long-form programming to strengthen weekend primetime, capitalize on non-news advertising revenue opportunities and to develop new franchises and formats.\n\nNEW SOURCES OF REVENUE: FROM FARMERS TO HUNTERS\n\nCNN is one of the world's most successful multi-platform global news brands, but we can't thrive as a company unless we find new sources of revenue to offset the structural pressures on legacy income streams. To address that challenge we're investing in new revenue, commercial and business affairs capabilities, drawing on pre-existing CNN expertise - including the highly entrepreneurial CNN International Commercial team - as well as top external talent. Our new revenue group is targeting the immediate near-term (0-6 months), medium-term (6-12 months) and over the long-term.\n\nWe've already achieved some significant wins this year, for instance engaging with multiple technology platforms on how best to partner around AI, and signing our first multi-million dollar licensing deal to unlock the value of our 44-year video archive.\n\nTo augment our core CNN Headlines FAST offering in the US and internationally, we will launch two more dedicated FAST channels later this year built around content from CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol to give us a suite of four FAST services to reaching digital streaming consumers. We believe that AVOD can be a growth driver for CNN alongside our established domestic and international core TV services.\n\nOther focus areas include: an assessment of the best way to monetize the value of CNN's digital audiences to advertisers; the development of CNN's features, lifestyle and other news-adjacent content to provide advertisers with more premium environments beyond hard news; working out how best to grow CNN's streaming and VOD footprints; and other long-term opportunities for growth.\n\nCULTURE AND COMMUNICATION\n\nOne of the successes of the transformation process was the creation of a \"Culture Committee\" made up of representatives from pretty much every department, bureau, and demographic across CNN. The committee not only drew on the insights in our recent Pulse Survey but connected with 350 people around the globe to identify areas of CNN's culture that themselves need change. Some of the news was good - optimism in CNN's future and belief in our mission is high almost everywhere despite the pressures our business is under. But there were tougher messages too - about bureaucracy, lack of opportunity, a culture that can sometimes stifle open debate, and management and communication that sometimes fall short of the mark.\n\nWe want to do everything we can to open this company's culture up to talent, opportunity and new ideas, and to foster an environment in which everyone feels valued and able to give their best. For that reason, I've accepted the recommendation of the committee to focus on five key priorities for cultural change, which they are actively working through proposed solutions and action around:\n\nOne CNN\n\nA new emphasis on collaboration and communication across platforms, regions and teams.\n\nLead with Transparency and Empower and Respect Our People\n\nClearer goals, more consistent feedback and career support, more transparent and candid communication, better training of management, greater accountability for leaders.\n\nInvest in Continuous Growth and Learning\n\nProvide more and better professional development opportunities, build on Mastercraft and create other new programmes to expand skills, wherever possible open vacant positions to competition and create more chances for employees to move laterally and widen their experience.\n\nActively Seek Out Diversity and Champion Inclusion and Community\n\nDiversity of background and thought will help CNN engage new audiences at home and abroad - so let's embrace DEI more fully and work to foster a CNN community based on fairness, openness and respect.\n\nValue the Full Employee\n\nBreaking news and a rapidly changing business can add up to a lot of pressure, so let's do a better job supporting colleagues, safeguarding well-being and mental health and recognizing the special challenges of working across geographies and cultures.\n\nIMPACT ON JOBS\n\nIn addition to some new posts and opportunities we have opened up at CNN, we're also announcing some staff reductions across the company today. Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles. However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk. The number of colleagues potentially impacted is around a hundred out of a workforce of more than 3,500, but I don't underestimate the impact this news is likely to have on everyone affected and want to thank them for everything they've done for this great news company over the years. Our priority throughout this process will be to treat them and every other CNN colleague with the respect, dignity, and the support you all deserve, including severance packages, career counseling and assistance with job placement.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThere's a lot to take in with these announcements, which is why my senior colleagues will share more information with you area by area and why we're holding a global Town Hall later today. Even if you can't join us live, do submit a remote question or come to another Town Hall in the coming months, or email me directly with questions or ideas.\n\nAs I said at the start, hundreds of you have been involved in developing the plans we're outlining today. I hope that, wherever you work at CNN, you'll feel that you can help ensure we implement them successfully,", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

CNN, which has more than 3,500 employees, said the cuts would happen across the company.\n\nSince taking over in October, Thompson has emphasized the importance of improving CNN's digital offerings as its legacy cable business declines. The parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery WBD 3.23%increase; green up pointing triangle, launched CNN Max last year, a live-news streaming service within its Max platform that carries some of the network's highest-profile content.\n\nThompson said in Wednesday's memo that CNN was building a billion-dollar-plus digital business. He declined to provide specifics about the coming digital-subscription product but said it would \"be significantly built out of CNN.com.\"\n\nThompson earlier served as CEO of the New York Times, where he oversaw a digital transformation that increased its subscribers from under 600,000 to more than six million.\n\nWhen asked if CNN would pursue a subscription bundle like the one the Times offers, he said: \"It's a logical possibility.\"\n\nThe memo said coming digital-subscription products would eventually include news and analysis as well as paid offerings around lifestyle journalism.\n\nDuring his initial address to staff last fall, Thompson said that conventional TV \"can no longer define us,\" and that the network is \"nowhere near ready for the future.\"\n\nCNN's prime-time viewership has sunk in recent quarters to levels not seen for about a decade. The network got a boost from last month's presidential debate, which was watched by 9.53 million people on CNN's platforms. In total, more than 50 million people tuned in to watch the debate, which was simulcast on other networks. CNN's prime-time viewership reverted back to the network's decade-low levels the day after the debate.\n\nOther cable-news networks have seen viewership decline since the pandemic, but to a far lesser degree than the drop experienced by CNN.\n\nSeparately, Warner Bros. Discovery, is planning a small number of layoffs in the coming weeks within the media conglomerate's entertainment operations, people close to the situation said. The cuts are part of the company's continuing efforts to streamline its myriad business operations and reduce redundancies, the people said.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, like many of its rivals, has been challenged by cord-cutting, a weak ad market and costly streaming investments.\n\nWrite to Isabella Simonetti at isabella.simonetti@wsj.com and Joe Flint at Joe.Flint@wsj.com", "source": {"uri": "wsj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wall Street Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_flint@wsj.com", "name": "Joe Flint", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "isabella_simonetti@wsj.com", "name": "Isabella Simonetti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Those employees, Thompson said, will be eligible for severance packages.\n\nSince his appointment last year, Thompson has been candid about the challenges facing CNN, stressing to staffers that swift and dramatic steps are necessary to reorient the television-focused news organization for a digital future.\n\nLike other legacy media companies, CNN has for its four-decade history relied heavily on carriage fees from the traditional cable news bundle, a declining business that has been upended by the advent of streaming services such as Netflix. While the company is still profitable to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, pivoting the network's business away from the contracting cable industry, which provides the bulk of CNN's revenue, to position it for the future will be an enormously difficult challenge.\n\nMark Thompson officially started on October 9 as CNN's chief executive and chairman and will also act as the network's editor-in-chief.\n\nArt Streiber/Warner Bros.

It happens in stages and over time,\" Thompson said in his memo to staff. \"Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\"\n\nThompson's announcement that he intends to build a digital subscription business generating more than a billion dollars in revenue represents a cornerstone of his strategy to \"future-proof\" CNN. A direct-to-consumer subscription product has long been seen by CNN's leaders as the answer to shrinking revenues brought on by the decline of linear television.\n\nFormer management launched CNN+, a subscription streaming service that was quickly shuttered when CNN's one-time parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery. The siloed news streaming service did not fit into Warner Bros. Discovery's business strategy, which called for building a super-streamer resembling the cable news bundle. CNN now boasts a much more budget-friendly streaming service, CNN Max, that lives alongside other brands like HBO inside its parent company's streaming service Max.\n\nThompson, who was light on specifics while announcing his plans for a digital subscription business, said CNN will create \"products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences.\" He said the first product will launch by the end of 2024.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_darcy@cnn.com", "name": "Oliver Darcy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson_(media_executive)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Thompson (media executive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

He emphasized that there will be an effort to keep users on CNN.com's website longer and finding ways to get them to return more.\n\nWhile CNN's digital products have primarily focused on text articles, Thompson said there will be a shift to more video content being provided.\n\n\"In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe organization is also going to develop more \"news you can use\" for its audience, with lifestyles and features content. Thompson said these products will provide the company with various monetization opportunities, including sponsorships, new advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription.\n\nCNN will also be pushing more into artificial intelligence, Thompson said, and will look at how it can safely use the technology to serve its audience.\n\nThompson, a former chief executive of the BBC and The New York Times, was named as the head of CNN in August 2023 and took over the role in October. He replaced Chris Licht, who was fired in June of that year.

The network will also embed digital video managers in editorial processes.\n\nCNN will also have hubs in Atlanta, London, Hong Kong and Los Angeles with a \"follow the sun\" approach where teams from one location will hand off newsgathering duties to one in a different time zone.\n\nFactchecking is now moving under the news division for tighter integration into editorial processes.

The network will also make a strategic push in AI, though details were not mentioned.\n\nCNN will also being to reshape its approach to digital, adding more video-based content to complement its existing text reporting, a move that Thompson aligns more closely with CNN's position as a TV news organization. It also plans to explore ways to better showcase its anchoring and reporting talent across all platforms.\n\nCNN has also hired Ben Monnie as senior vice president, product growth strategy, reporting to Alex MacCallum, executive vice president of digital who re-joined CNN earlier in 2024 after being part of the team that built the doomed streamer CNN+.

The broadcaster has fallen behind its competitors in recent years while also struggling with shrinking audiences as Americans ditch their traditional television subscriptions.\n\nThompson's mandate is to create a digital platform to reach audiences that consume news online, as well as halt the decline of CNN's traditional cable news business.\n\nCNN had signed its first \"multimillion-dollar licensing deal\" to drive value from its 44-year video archive, he added.\n\nHowever, Thompson also told staff that \"around a hundred out of a workforce of more than 3,500\" would lose their jobs, alongside other roles being created under the new structure.\n\nThompson is one of a number of media bosses in the US overseeing a strategic overhaul of their newsrooms, with fellow British executives Will Lewis and Emma Tucker both pushing through changes at the Washington Post and Wall Street Journal respectively.\n\nTraditional media groups are facing the need to reach new audiences through digital channels, such as TikTok and YouTube, while also protecting their legacy businesses and existing customers.\n\nIn 2022, CNN launched a digital subscription service called CNN+, but this was closed after just a month as new owners Warner Brothers Discovery focused on its Max streaming service. Thompson told the Financial Times in April that this had been \"a big bold experiment, which was abandoned rather briskly\".\n\nIn the memo to staff, Thompson said the new subscription service would \"aim to help our audience and customers live a better life by creating a growing stable of 'want-to-use' paid offerings anchored by lifestyle journalism where CNN is uniquely positioned to win\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States cable news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Thompson acquired tech review company Wirecutter and launched the cooking vertical during his nearly decade-long tenure at The Times.\n\nNow at CNN, Thompson faces a company struggling as the cable news business - and its revenue - steadily fades.\n\nOriginally founded by Ted Turner in 1980 as a 24-hour cable news network - a revolutionary concept at the time - CNN has long relied on distribution fees from cable companies.\n\nWhile CNN and parent company Warner Bros Discovery remain profitable, the cable TV business model is becoming defunct as Netflix and other popular streaming services have reinvented the television industry.\n\n\"Turning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair,\" Thompson said in his memo. \"It happens in stages and over time.\"\n\nA definitive CNN subscription business has been a long-time coming. While streaming service CNN+ was launched in March 2022, it was nearly immediately canceled when parent company WarnerMedia merged with Discovery the following month.\n\nNow, budget-friendly streaming service CNN Max can be found within the parent company's Max umbrella.\n\nBut Thompson said he plans to create a subscription that will generate more than $1 billion for the company.\n\nAnother proposed shift is a reimagining of the CNN newsroom. While currently split into three divisions - US television, international television and digital - Thompson wants to combine the three sections under one umbrella.\n\nThompson also wants to further involve artificial intelligence tools in the newsroom to \"reclaim\" Turner's \"pioneering spirit.\"\n\nThe CEO described embracing a \"follow the sun\" news model that would place greater importance on 24/7 worldwide stories by expanding the Hong Kong bureau and leaning more heavily on the London and LA bureaus.\n\n\"It will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn,\" Thompson said.\n\nAlong with the digital changes, Thompson announced minor updates to CNN's television programming, including unspecified new ideas from \"Anderson Cooper 360\" Executive Producer Charlie Moore and the creation of a \"TV Futures Lab\" to \"lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments.\"\n\nThompson's announcement comes after years of leadership turmoil.\n\nLongtime CEO Jeff Zucker abruptly left the company in 2022 and was replaced by television producer Chris Licht.\n\nLicht laid off hundreds of CNN staffers early into his new position. After Licht's brief one-year tenure, Thompson was appointed to repeat the success he had seen at The New York Times - which announced this year that its digital subscription business will earn more than $1 billion in annual revenue.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States cable news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The CEO's memo to staffers also noted that around 100 roles will be cut in the process. CNN currently operates with a workforce of more than 3,500 staffers.\n\n\"In addition to some new posts and opportunities we have opened up at CNN, we're also announcing some staff reductions across the company today,\" Thompson said. \"Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles. However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk.\"\n\nAside from workforce eliminations, Thompson's restructuring plans are wide-reaching, introducing a formal merger of CNN's three newsrooms which include US Newsgathering (TV), International Newsgathering (TV) and Global Digital News. Longtime CNN executive Virginia Moseley will helm the combined newsroom, responsible for all reporting for CNN platforms.\n\nThompson also plans to launch subscriber-first products, with the first launch prior to the end of 2024. While the details of the products were not revealed, Thompson is setting out to great the \"best-in-class, subscription-ready products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences,\" according to the memo.\n\n\"In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent,\" Thomson continued. \"Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform - from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more - it is essential for CNN's future.\"\n\nThompson brought in Alex MacCallum earlier this year to spearhead the digital product development and on Monday the CEO announced that Ben Monnie, joining from Google, will report to her as SVP of product growth strategy. Monnie also spent 10 years with the New York Times with both Thompson and MacCallum.\n\nThompson highlighted that the news media industry is undergoing significant changes in consumption, which he said, \"To me, the right response to this revolution is not despair but adaptation and innovation.\"\n\nAlongside the subscription plans, Thompson announced the creation of TV Futures Lab, which will develop and manage the network's streaming and VOD programming, which is available on the Max platform.\n\nRecently, the network relaunched Kate Bolduan's \"5 Things,\" series as a test case for the platform.

But it was the victim of corporate M&A as new parent Warner Bros Discovery shut it down after less than a month. The venerable news network is going to try again.\n\nLast Janurary, CNN CEO Mark Thompson, on his 100th day on the job, laid out plans for the news network's evolution in a memo. One of Thompson's goals would include combining all of CNN's newsgathering operations into one unit that will serve the network's TV, streaming, and digital platforms, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNow according to a report from Deadline this project is in motion with a \"one newsroom\" strategy that will merge TV and digital newsgathering ins a single operation. This will result in about 100 employees losing their jobs.\n\nCNN.com will also launch a subscription service later this year, putting some of its content behind a paywall. At the same time, CNN will launch a free ad-supported channel that will air CNN originals and other programming but not the same feed as its CNN cable network.\n\nExactly what content will be locked behind a paywall is unknown at this time. Though reports suggest many of their videos will soon be hidden behind a paywall.\n\nNow in an interview with the Financial Times, Thompson when asked about the future of CNN and cable TV said, \"But the rate at which people have been and probably will continue to cut the cord and not look at cable TV at all is a far, far greater strategic threat than the finer points of competition between individual cable channels.\" Thomas went on to say. \"The idea that there might be digital subscription is a serious possibility,\"\n\nThe move would represent a remarkable reversal for CNN, which infamously spent hundreds of millions of dollars on big-name anchors and a newsroom only to watch the launch fall flat, with Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav quickly pulling the plug on the service. Its implosion marked one of the biggest media flops in an industry littered with failures.\n\nThompson has the history to potentially pull off a successful digital subscription. During his tenure at The New York Times, he transformed the newspaper's online presence by successfully implementing a subscription model as the publication expanded its premium content, particularly around areas like travel, food, and health. For CNN, Thompson plans to start with news, the \"central proposition that the CNN brand brings to mind.\"\n\nIt's still unclear what that would look like or how much such a service would cost. It is also unclear how much video content CNN would put into this service and how much would remain free.\n\nThompson also told the The Wall Street Journal that he wants to find a better way to show video news on phones. The CEO said he wants to tap into formats popular with younger consumers to create a \"high quality, differentiated product\" that people will pay for.\n\nThe question is whether people will pay for CNN news on its website and apps. Increasingly, news has become something people think should be free, even as some publications have successfully put up pay walls, such as The Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the year will play out for CNN. For now, there aren't a lot of details to Thompson's plans.\n\nNo launch date or pricing for this new streaming service have been announced at this time.", "source": {"uri": "cordcuttersnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cord Cutters News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_bouma@cordcuttersnews.com", "name": "Luke Bouma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

On Wednesday, Thompson sent staffers a lengthy memo that builds on the foundation for his transformation of the news organization he inherited nine months ago.\n\nHarkening back to CNN founder Ted Turner's entrepreneurial spirit, Thompson updated employees on their key focus areas, including digital subscription offerings, streamlining the newsgathering process, the future of the linear television business, the addition of AI and job cuts.\n\nAccording to Deadline, which obtained the memo, Thompson indicated that the network will launch CNN.com's first direct-to-consumer subscription product by the end of 2024. \"We want to build on CNN.com's reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency,\" Thompson wrote, adding: \"We will reimagine watching, reading and listening to our journalism in a holistic way that meets users' changing needs and expectations across the day and week.\"\n\nThompson also noted that additional digital products will have a video focus, promising: \"Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform -- from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more -- it is essential for CNN's future.\"\n\nThe CNN newsroom will also undergo changes, with Thompson looking to combine domestic and international newsgathering and digital teams into one hub called Global News. The new organization will be comprised of two key work groups: news reporting and news video.\n\nPer Thompson, the news reporting group will \"chase and publish stories whether in the form of digital stories, live stories or traditional news alerts.\" Meanwhile, the news video group will \"capture and produce video stories increasingly in the spirit of capture once and produce/version for all platforms.\" That team will also be responsible for verifying news videos from various sources.\n\nAdditional. newsroom changes include rebranding the editorial oversight team The Row as CNN Factcheck and creating a new \"story manager\" role responsible for overseeing \"all editorial aspects of a story from beginning to publication/airing, improving editorial focus and long-term planning.\"\n\nAlong with the network's digital platforms, CNN's linear product will also see changes. Thompson announced the creation of a TV Futures Lab -- overseen by Eric Sherling, CNN's executive vice president of U.S. Programming -- that will \"not only develop and manage streaming and VOD programming for the Max platform, but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments.\"\n\nAdditionally, Charlie Moore, CNN's newly appointed vice president of primetime programming, has been tasked with finding ways to further develop and strengthen CNN's domestic offerings during the 8-11 p.m. block.\n\nThompson also indicated that the network will make a \"strategic push into AI\" based around how to safely deploy the emerging technology in ways that \"deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively.\"\n\nWhile new hires will accompany this wave of new changes, there will also be a significant reduction in CNN's 3,500-person workforce. Thompson indicated that around 100 jobs will be eliminated as his plans are put into place. Concrete details on which positions will be eliminated will be conveyed to affected staff by their immediate supervisors.\n\nThompson said he would address the layoffs as well as all the other changes he outlined in his memo during a global town hall and encouraged staff to submit questions.\n\n\"I don't underestimate the impact this news is likely to have on everyone affected and want to thank them for everything they've done for this great news company over the years,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ted Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_ad-supported_streaming_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free ad-supported streaming television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Global News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://abn-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Mark-Thompson-CNN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721330", "eventUri": "eng-9721330", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He said that the subscription offerings will be \"want to use\" paid offerings\" that will be anchored by lifestyle journalism.\n\nHe also announced the launch of additional FAST Channels later this year, with CNN Originals and CNN en Espanol debuting later this year. They will be added to the CNN and CNN International FAST channels.\n\nThompson had signalled staff reductions in a previous memo as it restructures its operations.\n\nHe wrote, \"Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles. However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk. The number of colleagues potentially impacted is around a hundred out of a workforce of more than 3,500, but I don't underestimate the impact this news is likely to have on everyone affected and want to thank them for everything they've done for this great news company over the years.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, America and the world turned their attention to a CNN studio in Atlanta. The programme we broadcast that night was one of the most consequential not just in our history but that of the whole of TV news. It was also a perfect example of everything CNN stands for. Fairness. Total professionalism. A commitment to be there for our audiences when it matters most and to live up to Ted Turner's founding mission for this great news company.\n\nFrom the day I joined CNN nine months ago, I've talked about the need to take this precious inheritance and future-proof it for a very different media future. Back in January I set out some big themes:\n\nToday is a key milestone in the transformation of CNN because, after months of work by literally hundreds of you, we're now able to set out in more detail how we plan to turn these themes into reality. In the sections below you'll read of plans to move from today to an integrated and significantly streamlined multimedia news operation; a bold new digital strategy which includes the launch before the end of the year of CNN.com's first direct-to-consumer subscription product; the creation of a TV Futures lab to develop formats and distribution opportunities for the linear news experience on digital platforms; plans to open up other new sources of revenue for CNN; and much else besides. Some of these plans will require investment and there will be new roles and opportunities in many areas. But we're also closing some posts and you'll read about those in this memo as well.\n\nTurning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time. Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\n\nA GLOBAL INTEGRATED MULTIMEDIA NEWS OPERATION\n\nCNN has historically had three separate newsrooms and multiple planning operations. We're moving today to a single global multimedia editorial operation to take on the challenges of our multi-platform, multi-product future.\n\nOne newsroom. We're merging the newsgathering and digital news teams that currently sit in US domestic and international news to create unified operations under a new Global News organization. These new integrated teams will report out the news, produce it and publish it with a minimum of friction and duplication. Domestic and international news desks will retain their domestic and international specialisms for now, but will work more closely together, and come together to share resources for big breaking stories. Those who previously worked as a digital news writer or editor, or news desk producer or editor, working in separate structures and performing often duplicative tasks, will join unified teams in the US and our main international hubs.\n\nThese hubs will have a single editorial head to lead news coverage from their geography. There are two work groups under this leadership - news reporting and news video. The news reporting teams will chase and publish stories whether in the form of digital stories, live stories, or traditional news alerts. The news video teams will capture and produce video stories increasingly in the spirit of capture once and produce/version for all platforms.\n\nThe news video team will chase down, originate, ingest and verify news video from all sources, whether that's on-the-ground video shot by our own journalists, social media video needing verification, video from agencies or affiliates or other sources. They will alert incoming video to the network for use on all platforms, TV and digital. Embedded within the news video team will be a group of digital video specialists, who will produce, edit, and publish video for digital platforms. The digital video specialists will report up to Alex MacCallum's organization but will work day-to-day alongside global news colleagues.The video team will also handle correspondents' live shots, liaise with TV and streaming shows to satisfy their requirements and handle any TV-specific package requirements.\n\nWe're also introducing the new role of \"story manager\" to run all editorial aspects of a story from beginning to publication/airing, improving editorial focus and long-term planning. This move to story-centric editorial support and management is a break from our current practice, which is to base editorial support on region or shift. We will assign story managers to all major stories and breaking news to manage the editorial execution and create more space to focus on day 2+ reporting. These leads will be placed in all major CNN bureaus around the world.\n\nAdditionally, the Row will be renamed \"CNN Factcheck\" and move under the Global News division as an integrated part of the reporting process, working with story managers from the start of the story lifecycle.\n\nTo ensure consistent, multiplatform coverage around the clock, we will supercharge CNN's\u202f\"Follow the Sun\"\u202fmodel with a new fully blended editorial structure across our hubs globally.\u202fThe new operating model will create an integrated newsgathering, text and video operation and place ownership of it in the hands of editorial hubs around the world.\n\nThis will streamline workflows across newsgathering and place editorial direction closer to the story. It will better equip us to handle a wider array of platform needs around the clock and will mean we can flex news desk resources when the news cycle takes an unexpected turn. The enhanced Follow the Sun model will also create an expanded role for CNN's Hong Kong hub in US overnight hours and make greater use of our operations in London and Los Angeles at additional hours across the day.\n\nWe've created a consistent, centralized planning process to maximize coverage opportunities across platforms.\u202fWe've introduced a new, unitary planning group for the whole of CNN to ensure we're planning stories and deployments with the needs of every part of the organization in mind. This will give us full visibility into everything from editorial and logistics to resources and budgets. It will also allow us to seamlessly coordinate our work, and understand what teams are doing, where and why.\u202fWe implemented this reform several weeks ago and have already seen significant positive results. With this change, we will be better positioned to capitalize on the news across platforms on a day to day, week to week and long-term basis.\n\nWe will streamline and standardize story-pitching. We know that stories are pitched in many different ways across teams and departments. By creating a clearly defined process and standardizing the information needed for every pitch, we will increase our ability to plan coverage, distribute it across multiple platforms, deliver better financial accountability, and eliminate some of the bottlenecks that currently slow us down.\n\nWe will embed expertise throughout the news operation, sharing skills and knowledge with multi-platform thinking to the fore. Rather than separate tribes of TV and digital, international and domestic, we need to recognize that we are all journalists and storytellers first and foremost. We plan to provide more opportunities for everyone to learn new skills and new forms of storytelling, and more chances to move from one part of CNN to another. The new operating model for news is very different from how we work today, and we'll take the next few weeks to transition to the new state.\n\nBUILDING A BILLION DOLLAR PLUS DIGITAL BUSINESS\n\nCNN is already the largest branded digital news destination in the world. As well as amazing reach, we have many millions of deeply engaged loyal users. We plan to take the journalistic firepower, user-experience and commercial potential of CNN Digital to the next level with strategic commitment, significant fresh investment, an injection of specialist expertise and plenty of creativity and experimentation. We will develop new digital products with a special focus on digital experiences worth paying for.\n\nFirst, we will create best-in-class, subscription-ready products that will provide need-to-know news, analysis and context in compelling new formats and experiences, starting with CNN.com's first subscription product launching before the end of 2024. We want to build on CNN.com's reach with a new focus on engagement and frequency - how long our users spend with us and how often they return - by improving the quality of the product experience and giving users powerful reasons to come back to us more often.\n\nWe will reimagine watching, reading and listening to our journalism in a holistic way that meets users' changing needs and expectations across the day and week. And we will work harder to tell them not just what's happening now, but what it means and what's likely to happen next.\n\nSecond, we will lean more heavily into video in our digital products. Our products today are primarily reading experiences. We have a huge stable of loyal users who love reading CNN and we will continue to meet their needs. But more than anything the CNN brand stands for news brought to you in moving pictures and sound with an onscreen anchor or correspondent acting as a trusted guide. In the future our digital products need to do a far better job of reflecting CNN's massive strength in video and anchoring/reporting talent. Video will be at the heart of our future and a re-imagined video experience on every platform - from pure digital to streaming, FAST channels and more - it is essential for CNN's future. Migrating our video-based onscreen talent onto our branded platforms and the wider digital news ecosystem is potentially a key differentiator for us and will also be a focus for early experimentation and development.\n\nThird, we will aim to help our audience and customers \"live a better life,\" as Ted Turner promised on our founding day in 1980, by creating a growing stable of \"news you can use\" offerings anchored by lifestyle and features areas where CNN already has brand permission and is competitively positioned to win. Such products offer multiple opportunities for monetization through sponsorship, advertising and direct-to-consumer subscription. We are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength like consumer advice with CNN Underscored and health, as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further.\n\nFinally, we want to reclaim the \"pioneering spirit\" Ted Turner talked about at our founding and regain a leadership position in the news experiences of the future. This effort will include a strategic push into AI to determine how best to safely harness this emerging new technology to serve our audiences and deliver our journalistic goals more effectively and responsively. We will work closely with the new ideas labs being created in both the News and TV organizations. We will also aim to develop the sophistication of our data science to improve our understanding of our audiences, the quality and value of our digital advertising product and to drive our new digital subscription businesses to greater growth.\n\nTHE FUTURE OF TV AT CNN\n\nTed Turner founded CNN in 1980 as a TV news company, and TV will always be a central part of the CNN offering to America and the world. There are some stories and moments of drama which can only be fully appreciated and shared through live TV and streaming, as our presidential debate demonstrated so powerfully two weeks ago.\n\nBut as everyone knows, we're living through a revolution in both news and television consumption from which our domestic and international TV channels are certainly not immune. To me, the right response to this revolution is not despair but adaptation and innovation.\n\nOur experimentation with formats like 5 Things on Max and now CNN.com is a good recent example. A second is the changes we made at the start of this year to our US morning programming, introducing a line-up that's delivering better audience performance with lower production costs.\n\nWe're announcing today the creation of TV Futures Lab reporting to Eric Sherling. The lab will not only develop and manage streaming and VOD programming for the Max platform but will lead new thinking about ways to migrate the linear news experience to other new digital environments. The lab will also partner with Digital Products and Services and other parts of CNN to develop and programme other experimental new services.\n\nIn his new role overseeing primetime, Charlie Moore is now actively working with Eric, our top EPs and other CNN colleagues to find ways to further develop and strengthen our domestic primetime offering. Our recent journalistic performance has been outstanding, from major election set-pieces to the Trump trial to a flurry of exclusive interviews and features. I've asked Eric and Charlie to explore how to build on that, increase audience competitiveness and also keep a close eye on production costs.\n\nWe're already modernizing other aspects of production, using technology to reduce expense, develop new revenue opportunities or to deliver a better service to our viewers. We are streamlining the way we produce the news ticker that appears on the bottom of the CNN screen, launching new FAST channels for CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, and recently aired an experimental programme on the Trump Trial that used AI to turn the court transcript into an almost instant audio dialogue.\n\nWe've also reinvested in CNN Originals with outside partners and other long-form programming to strengthen weekend primetime, capitalize on non-news advertising revenue opportunities and to develop new franchises and formats.\n\nNEW SOURCES OF REVENUE: FROM FARMERS TO HUNTERS\n\nCNN is one of the world's most successful multi-platform global news brands, but we can't thrive as a company unless we find new sources of revenue to offset the structural pressures on legacy income streams. To address that challenge we're investing in new revenue, commercial and business affairs capabilities, drawing on pre-existing CNN expertise - including the highly entrepreneurial CNN International Commercial team - as well as top external talent. Our new revenue group is targeting the immediate near-term (0-6 months), medium-term (6-12 months) and over the long-term.\n\nWe've already achieved some significant wins this year, for instance engaging with multiple technology platforms on how best to partner around AI, and signing our first multi-million dollar licensing deal to unlock the value of our 44-year video archive.\n\nTo augment our core CNN Headlines FAST offering in the US and internationally, we will launch two more dedicated FAST channels later this year built around content from CNN Originals and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol to give us a suite of four FAST services to reaching digital streaming consumers. We believe that AVOD can be a growth driver for CNN alongside our established domestic and international core TV services.\n\nOther focus areas include: an assessment of the best way to monetize the value of CNN's digital audiences to advertisers; the development of CNN's features, lifestyle and other news-adjacent content to provide advertisers with more premium environments beyond hard news; working out how best to grow CNN's streaming and VOD footprints; and other long-term opportunities for growth.\n\nCULTURE AND COMMUNICATION\n\nOne of the successes of the transformation process was the creation of a \"Culture Committee\" made up of representatives from pretty much every department, bureau, and demographic across CNN. The committee not only drew on the insights in our recent Pulse Survey but connected with 350 people around the globe to identify areas of CNN's culture that themselves need change. Some of the news was good - optimism in CNN's future and belief in our mission is high almost everywhere despite the pressures our business is under. But there were tougher messages too - about bureaucracy, lack of opportunity, a culture that can sometimes stifle open debate, and management and communication that sometimes fall short of the mark.\n\nWe want to do everything we can to open this company's culture up to talent, opportunity and new ideas, and to foster an environment in which everyone feels valued and able to give their best. For that reason, I've accepted the recommendation of the committee to focus on five key priorities for cultural change, which they are actively working through proposed solutions and action around:\n\nOne CNN\n\nA new emphasis on collaboration and communication across platforms, regions and teams.\n\nLead with Transparency and Empower and Respect Our People\n\nClearer goals, more consistent feedback and career support, more transparent and candid communication, better training of management, greater accountability for leaders.\n\nInvest in Continuous Growth and Learning\n\nProvide more and better professional development opportunities, build on Mastercraft and create other new programmes to expand skills, wherever possible open vacant positions to competition and create more chances for employees to move laterally and widen their experience.\n\nActively Seek Out Diversity and Champion Inclusion and Community\n\nDiversity of background and thought will help CNN engage new audiences at home and abroad - so let's embrace DEI more fully and work to foster a CNN community based on fairness, openness and respect.\n\nValue the Full Employee\n\nBreaking news and a rapidly changing business can add up to a lot of pressure, so let's do a better job supporting colleagues, safeguarding well-being and mental health and recognizing the special challenges of working across geographies and cultures.\n\nIMPACT ON JOBS\n\nIn addition to some new posts and opportunities we have opened up at CNN, we're also announcing some staff reductions across the company today. Wherever possible, we've closed open positions rather than target currently occupied roles. However, some of our colleagues will learn today that their jobs are being eliminated or are at risk. The number of colleagues potentially impacted is around a hundred out of a workforce of more than 3,500, but I don't underestimate the impact this news is likely to have on everyone affected and want to thank them for everything they've done for this great news company over the years. Our priority throughout this process will be to treat them and every other CNN colleague with the respect, dignity, and the support you all deserve, including severance packages, career counseling and assistance with job placement.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThere's a lot to take in with these announcements, which is why my senior colleagues will share more information with you area by area and why we're holding a global Town Hall later today. Even if you can't join us live, do submit a remote question or come to another Town Hall in the coming months, or email me directly with questions or ideas.\n\nAs I said at the start, hundreds of you have been involved in developing the plans we're outlining today. I hope that, wherever you work at CNN, you'll feel that you can help ensure we implement them successfully,", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors":

Read our full Disclosure here.\n\nIn a memo sent to staff Wednesday morning, CNN chief executive Mark Thompson said the network would lay off 100 employees as it pushes to expand its digital programs.\n\nThe network said the memo outlined a plan to \"build a billion-dollar digital business, experiment with artificial intelligence and overhaul key newsroom structures.\"\n\nThe far-reaching measures, which Thompson described to staffers in a memo as a \"key milestone in the transformation of CNN,\" will result in about 100 employees, or about three percent of the workforce, being laid off. Those employees, Thompson said, will be eligible for severance packages.\n\nSince his appointment last year, Thompson has been candid about the challenges facing CNN, stressing to staffers that swift and dramatic steps are necessary to reorient the television-focused news organization for a digital future.\n\nLike other legacy media companies, CNN has for its four-decade history relied heavily on carriage fees from the traditional cable news bundle, a declining business that has been upended by the advent of streaming services such as Netflix. While the company is still profitable to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, pivoting the network's business away from the contracting cable industry, which provides the bulk of CNN's revenue, to position it for the future will be an enormously difficult challenge.\n\n\"Turning a great news organization towards the future is not a one-day affair. It happens in stages and over time,\" Thompson said in his memo to staff. \"Today's announcements do not answer every question or seek to solve every challenge we face. However, they do represent a significant step forward and I hope you will read about them in that spirit.\"\n\n\"CNN last had significant layoffs in late 2022 under previous CEO Chris Licht.

Discovery-owned unit \"will lean more heavily into digital products.\" He said CNN.com will offer its first digital subscription product by the end of this year, but did not specify what the new offering will carry.\n\nThompson, who joined CNN from the New York Times Co. last year, has focused on how to strengthen the news operation's business while its chief source of revenue, pay TV subscribers, is in steady decline. The network's prime time TV ratings are down dramatically from the highs reached in 2020.\n\nCNN already reaches a massive audience through its digital platforms, but all of the content is currently free and does not generate the kind of ad rates attainable through traditional TV. Watching the CNN channel live still requires a pay TV subscription, which many consumers are dropping through cord-cutting as they depend on streaming for video content.\n\n\"CNN is one of the world's most successful multi-platform global news brands,\" Thompson wrote. \"But we can't thrive as a company unless we find new sources of revenue to offset the structural pressures on legacy income streams.\"\n\nThompson added that the company's investment in digital will be aimed at developing new products that consumers will be willing to pay for.\n\n\"We are currently assessing existing areas of digital strength like consumer advice with CNN Underscored and health, as well as other less established categories to decide which areas to develop further,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe 100 eliminated employees will be informed of their status on Wednesday. CNN has 3,500 employees worldwide.\n\nCNN had a major round of layoffs in 2022 after parent company Warner Bros. Discovery took ownership. The broader news business has been battered by cost cutting in recent years as organizations struggle to generate sustainable income, with audiences getting more of their information online.\n\nThompson's memo also noted that Charlie Moore, executive producer for Anderson Cooper's program, will oversee all of prime time on the channel -- and most likely be in charge of a revamp. The newer additions to prime time -- Kaitlan Collins, Abby Phillip and Laura Coates -- have failed to catch on with viewers who are locked into commentary-driven shows on MSNBC and Fox News.\n\nCNN did recently score a coup by having the first 2024 presidential debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on June 27. The event was watched by 51 million viewers, who witnessed a disastrous performance by Biden, who has fended off calls to drop out of the race ever since.\n\nIf the Democratic ticket changes, the telecast moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash could go down as the most consequential debate in history.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cord-cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The shift away from traditional TV will be painful, he added. \"We recognize its potentially enormous impact on the individuals affected,\" Thompson wrote to his 4,000 employees world wide. He declined to provide the Journal with further details about his shift to digital but said the move would \"be significantly built out of CNN.com.\"\n\nIn addition to a streamlined focus on traditional news topics, Thompson wrote that a separate division would expand CNN's \"lifestyle journalism,\" an admission that political news coverage will not save the network from its ratings free fall. TV news \"can no longer define us,\" he added, writing that the network is \"nowhere near ready for the future.\"\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, which owns CNN, has announced separate plans to conduct a small number of layoffs in the coming weeks, according to sources who spoke with the outlet. The challenge of cord-cutting continues to force mainstream media outlets to adapt to new platforms, fewer paid subscribers, and even slash the seven-figure salaries of their on-air talent.\n\nIn May the network reported its lowest viewership levels in decades. Between May 13th and 19th, CNN nabbed an average of 83,000 viewers in the crucial 25-54 age demographic between 8 and 11 p.m., the lowest level seen in over 30 years. Across all demos, the network lagged far behind its peers in a news ratings race it no longer appears qualified to run. In the past period, CNN garnered 494,000 viewers compared to 2 million for Fox and 1.1 million for MSNBC. Thompson at the time attributed the sagging ratings to a holdover effect as his CNN transitions away from traditional news and directs more of its focus to pop culture topics.\n\n\"We don't believe news is just politics. Business and tech are news. Climate and weather are news. Health, wellness, and living longer are news. So expect to see us build new branded verticals in all these areas on TV, on our apps, and across our other platforms,\" Thompson said.\n\nOne of Thompson's first major moves was to propose dramatically slashing the salaries of its biggest talent. Top-earning anchors include Anderson Cooper at $20 million, Wolf Blitzer at $15 million, Jake Tapper at $8.5 million, and Chris Wallace at $8 million. Lower-level anchors including John Berman, Kate Bolduan, and Sara Sidner hold annual salaries between $1 million and $2 million. However, Thompson will have to wait until at least 2025 or even 2026 when contracts expire and he can renegotiate paychecks for his top stars.\n\nNo matter where it turns, CNN seems to fall victim to itself. Thompson canned former NBA star and notorious anti-Trumper Charles Barkley after his show \"King Charles\" failed to deliver and the basketball icon was reported to have called the network a \"s***show\" while it was courting him. Even when CNN succeeded by hosting town halls with Trump, the moves prompted grumbling among its reporters and media personalities who blamed network executives for amplifying so-called falsehoods.", "source": {"uri": "fromthetrenchesworldreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "From the Trenches World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cable_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States cable news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Thompson's memo said the network was creating a billion-dollar-plus digital business. He declined to offer the WSJ specifics about the coming digital-subscription service but said it would \"be significantly built out of CNN.com.\"\n\nReports of the planned subscription service first emerged in January, when Thompson outlined plans to combine the network's TV, streaming and digital presence.\n\nAs PYMNTS wrote at the time, these changes are happening as consumers' media diets are moving away from traditional cable, with consumers canceling their cable and pay TV subscriptions by the millions every year.\n\n\"Cord cutting started in 2008 -- right around the time of the Great Recession -- and slowly gained a head of steam as millennials, mostly, gravitated to the streaming content that they could access on their laptops or connected TVs -- and soon thereafter, their smartphones,\" PYMNTS' Karen Webster wrote last fall.\n\n\"Netflix and specialty websites filled the news and entertainment content gap with better content delivered via new and cheaper business models. The ranks of the cord cutters rose.\"\n\nAs that report also noted, CNN does have a somewhat spotty track record with subscription models. In 2022, the short-lived CNN+ shut down one month after launching in the wake of WarnerMedia and Discovery's merger.\n\nAnd in times of economic distress, consumers aren't keen on adding more digital media subscriptions. The report \"The One-Stop Bill Pay Playbook: Drivers of Consumers' Bill Payment Priorities,\" a PYMNTS Intelligence and Mastercard collaboration, found that only 22% would prioritize paying their digital media subscription bills in full above others. Meanwhile, 20% would skip payment on their digital media bills until they could afford it, 20% would pay just a portion of the bill and 38% would cancel the service.", "source": {"uri": "pymnts.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PYMNTS.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarnerMedia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WarnerMedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastercard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millennials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cord-cutting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CNN-streaming.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721330", "eventUri": "eng-9721330", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 135}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

And perhaps no network more so than CNN. Following parent-company Warner Bros.' merger with Discovery in 2022, newly installed (and since dispatched) CEO Chris Licht reportedly pushed staff to take a slightly more down-the-middle approach to political reporting. In an age of hyperpolarization, that doesn't get you very far; ratings have plummeted to a consistent third place for the past two years, outflanked on the Left and Right by MSNBC and Fox News.\n\nNow, Thompson is trying to reorient the TV news giant for a future in which TV isn't all that central to the news ecosystem.

Prepare to be asked before year's end", "body": "The cable news network plans to launch a new subscription product -- details TBD -- by the end of 2024. Will Mark Thompson repeat his New York Times success, or is CNN too different a brand to get people spending?\n\nPaying for CNN is not something people are used to.\n\nLet me rephrase that: Directly paying for CNN is not something people are used to. For decades, an overwhelming majority of American households paid for cable or satellite service, and an opaque slice of that monthly charge -- around $1 or so -- found its way to Turner, Time Warner, AOL Time Warner, AT&T, Warner Bros. Discovery, or whatever other corporate daddy ran the place at the time.\n\nThat was only one slice of the revenue pie, of course -- add in advertising, licensing, international, and so on -- but it was the most reliable piece, the one that felt like a tax on modern American existence. It all added up to a really good business -- one that threw off a little over $5.2 billion in profits in the 2010s.\n\nBut that revenue line is evaporating, quickly. The number of U.S. cable subscribers has fallen from 98.7 million in 2016 to 58 million in 2023, with projections -- optimistic ones, arguably -- putting that number at 40 million by 2028. That's a lot of monthly $1 charges gone. Add in a steep ratings decline (and an accompanying ad collapse) and the future looks very fuzzy.\n\nYou can read all of Thompson's memo here. Much of what he outlines -- unifying distinct news operations, streamlining planning processes, becoming more multiplatform -- seems thoroughly reasonable, if at times painful. (The changes will lead to the elimination of roughly 100 jobs.) But most interesting is the plan for \"BUILDING A BILLION DOLLAR PLUS DIGITAL BUSINESS\" via new subscription products. Here's Thompson (emphasis his):\n\nBut I don't think it's wrong to be skeptical, at least initially, about the prospects of a CNN.com subscription product. (And the others that will presumably follow this one -- once a bundler, always a bundler.) Yes, CNN.com reaches a huge audience; by some measures, it's the most popular news site in the world. But are those readers committed enough to the CNN brand to convert to monthly paying subscribers?\n\nSecond, the boom times for digital news subscriptions seem to be, if not over, ebbing. The Times has established itself as the space's American winner; it is to general-interest digital news subs what Amazon is to online retail or Google is to search, a massive gravitational force that makes being No. 2 a lot like being No. 10. Look at the Post, a paper that has managed to lose half its digital subscribers in just a few years. Look at Gannett, whose digital subs count peaked a year ago and has been flat-to-down since. Or look at this year's Digital News Report, which showed the share of people who say they pay for digital news flat for the past three years. Is the CNN digital brand -- as huge as it is -- distinctive enough to get people to add another subscription to their credit cards?\n\nFinally, CNN has been down this road before. Remember 2017, the last time CNN was going to build a \"BILLION DOLLAR PLUS DIGITAL BUSINESS\" via CNN.com subscription products?\n\nThose products never reached the market -- even though 2017 was a significantly more opportune moment than now. I suspect that's because testing found limited demand for those personality-driven verticals. (Also, remember NewsCo?)\n\nCNN journalists do a lot of great work, and I wish these efforts well. But my strong suspicion is that the drivers of cable news success, of free web success, and digital subscription success are too distinct from one another for CNN's brand to carry over at scale.", "source": {"uri": "niemanlab.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nieman Lab"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_benton@niemanlab.org", "name": "Joshua Benton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarnerMedia", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WarnerMedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

CNN Forced To Make HUGE Announcement ... They're COLLAPSING!", "body": "OPINION| In a move that has left many Americans reaching for the popcorn, CNN CEO Mark Thompson has announced that the network will be laying off 100 employees. Yes, you read that correctly, the same CNN that once prided itself on being the \"most trusted name in news\" is now resorting to layoffs to try and keep its head above water.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Isn't CNN supposed to be a bastion of journalistic integrity and excellence?\" Well, according to Thompson, the layoffs are part of a \"key milestone in the transformation of CNN.\" Translation: they're trying to save money because their ratings are tanking faster than a lead balloon.\n\nBut let's take a step back and examine this move. CNN, a network that once had the ear of the American public, has now become a laughingstock. Their biased reporting, constant fear-mongering, and blatant disregard for the truth have left many Americans turning to alternative sources of news.\n\nAnd now, in a desperate attempt to stay afloat, they're resorting to layoffs. It's like watching a slow-motion train wreck, and you can't help but wonder how much longer they can keep this charade going.\n\nBut here's the thing, folks. CNN's problems go much deeper than just layoffs. They've lost the trust of the American people, and no amount of cost-cutting measures can fix that. The American people are tired of being lied to, manipulated, and insulted by a network that claims to be on their side.\n\nSo, what's the solution? It's simple, really. CNN needs to take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask themselves why they've become so disconnected from the American people. They need to rediscover the principles of honest journalism, and they need to start reporting the news instead of trying to shape it.\n\nIn the meantime, we'll be over here, enjoying the show. Watching CNN implode is like watching a bad reality TV show, and you can't help but wonder what will happen next. Will they finally get the message and start reporting the news objectively?

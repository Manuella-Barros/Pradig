At the Only Watch charitable auction in 2019, a steel model sold for US$31 million, setting a record.\n\nStallone's version of the two-sided timepiece, with its 20 complications-the most Patek has ever put in a wristwatch-is in white gold. It has five different chiming modes, features a perpetual calendar and can track two time zones. The watch is so rare, even for the vaunted Swiss watchmaker, that it comes with an elaborate presentation box that includes a collection book and plaque, both with Stallone's name, an original certificate, cuff links and an iPad in a Patek Philippe leather case. The watch itself remains in its plastic wrapping; the action star has never worn it.\n\nSotheby's has assigned Stallone's Grandmaster Chime an estimate of US$2.5 million to US$5 million, though it could certainly go for more.\n\nThat watch joins other sought-after Patek Philippes, as well as watches from Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Rolex and Piaget. A group of Panerai watches, including the one Stallone wore in the film Expendables 2, round out the collection, which will sell as part of the Sotheby's Important Watches sale in New York City.\n\nStallone, now 77, says he's owned the watch long enough and it's time to move on. He is a longtime watch collector who at one point owned around 100 timepieces. \"I've been a client and enthusiast of Patek Philippe for many years,\" he tells Bloomberg.\n\n\"When I look back on my time with Patek and the watches I've collected, I feel a sense of pride. There's this feeling that I've made it. \"\n\nAccording to Stallone, he bought the Grandmaster Chime as a collector with no intention to wear it. He says the watch was not easy to come by; he had to appeal to the highest levels at the company to be allocated one. He likens the timepiece to a Monet-a work of art-and says letting it go is \"bittersweet.\"\n\n\"When you have a great watch and it grows in popularity,\" he says, \"it's a constant reminder that hard work pays off.\"\n\nTwo highly coveted Nautilus models are in the sale, too. A 2021 stainless steel reference 5711/13000A-001, with a green sunburst dial and diamonds on the bezel, is estimated to sell for US$200,000 to US$400,000 for its extreme rarity. A steel blue-dial reference 5711/1A-001 is estimated to sell in a range of US$50,000 to US$100,000. The 5711 line has been discontinued, causing its values on the secondary market to soar.\n\nStallone also has a longstanding relationship with Panerai, the maker of thick dive watches that is owned by Swiss luxury juggernaut Richemont. After the actor wore one in the 1994 film Daylight, the company experienced a boost in public interest. \"But for Sylvester Stallone, Panerai wouldn't be what it it is today,\" says Geoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches for the Americas. \"I'm not sure we'd even know about Panerai.\"\n\nStallone's friend Arnold Schwarzenegger then began wearing Panerai, and Stallone went on to wear a Panerai Bronzo in the film Expendables 2; he can be seen wearing it in the poster. According to Hess, he gave Bronzos to key fellow cast members including Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Liam Hemsworth, Chuck Norris and Schwarzenegger.\n\n\"I always thought the bronze PAM00382 Luminor was incredible, because of the metal,\" Stallone says. \"Its design reminds me of the Titanic-a porthole-and has this industrial feel. I knew I had to wear it in the movie, because it was going to make such a statement.\"\n\nThe one he's selling is numbered 000, \"so it's likely the first one Panerai ever made,\" he adds. \"I put this thing through its paces-underwater, above water, in the sand, fight scenes-you name it. It was my companion throughout that film and longer than that. I've derived so much pleasure from this watch. And now, why not have someone else enjoy it as much as I did?\"\n\nOther watches in the group include an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Tourbillon 50th Anniversary that's estimated in the range of US$100,000 to US$200,000 and a pink gold Rolex Day-Date for US$25,000 to US$50,000.\n\nSotheby's Hess managed to land the sale because of a yearslong relationship with Stallone. When Hess was at rival auction house Phillips, he worked with the actor in 2020 on a sale of five watches, including that Daylight Panerai. He also says a distant tie stretches all the way back to Hess's childhood.\n\n\"If you look at the credits at the end of every Rocky movie, they say: 'This film is dedicated to the enduring memory of Jane Oliver,'\" Hess says. Oliver was Stallone's first manager in the late 1970s-and Hess's cousin. \"She gave me an autographed picture that says 'To Geoffrey from Sly,' he says. \"I've had it for 47 years.\"\n\nHess connected with Stallone in 2019, and they began working together. He knew Stallone had the Grandmaster Chime, and together they worked out the right time to sell it. \"I'm gearing up for what I hope could be a record for a modern watch\" at a non-charity auction, Hess says. \"We're certainly shooting for a record for a watch from the 21st century.\" BLOOMBERG", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"},

headliner is a Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300 which is expected to fetch between 2.5 and five million dollars (\u00a31.99 million and \u00a33.97 million).\n\nSylvester Stallone arriving for the UK premiere of The Expendables 2 (Ian West/PA)\n\nThe watch, unveiled in 2014, was designed to be Patek Philippe's most intricate and complicated wristwatch in the company's history and comprises 20 complications, including five chiming modes, a reversible case, two independent dials and six patented innovations.\n\nStallone's Grandmaster Chime comes in its single sealed casing with a presentation box engraved with Stallone's name as well as a certificate of origin confirming him as the original purchaser.\n\nThe lot also includes, among other things, product literature, a

400,000 dollars (\u00a3159,000 and \u00a3318,000).\n\nThere is also an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Tourbillon 50th Anniversary watch which could fetch between 100,000 to 200,000 dollars (\u00a379,500 to

watches over the years, each with its own unique character and history.\n\n\"I enjoy the collecting process like so many others in this passionate community, who don't just see watches as an accessory, but admire them for their history, craftsmanship, artistry - but most importantly - how they make them feel.\n\n\"Looking at these watches, I feel truly lucky to have owned them; they serve as a reminder that hard work pays off.\n\n\"While parting ways with this collection is bittersweet, I cherish that I've owned them with pride, and hope they will be appreciated and admired in their next homes.\"\n\nGeoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches, Americas said: \"While many recognise Stallone as the legendary actor behind characters like Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, watch enthusiasts know

elegance of a piece-unique Panerai.\n\n\"Not only does Sly's collection offer discerning collectors the chance to acquire a rare work of horology, but one which has been handpicked and cherished by an American icon as well.\n\n\"It's particularly thrilling to bring the astonishing Patek Grandmaster Chime, one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world, to the rostrum at Sotheby's.\n\n\"With Sly being a personal friend, the opportunity to work with him and present this part of his collection to market is a privilege that eclipses virtually any watch project I've worked on in my

At the Only Watch charitable auction in 2019, a steel model sold for $31 million, setting a record.\n\nStallone's version of the two-sided timepiece, with its 20 complications -- the most Patek has ever put in a wristwatch -- is in white gold. It has five different chiming modes, features a perpetual calendar and can track two time zones. The watch is so rare, even for the vaunted Swiss watchmaker, that it comes with an elaborate presentation box that includes a collection book and plaque, both with Stallone's name, an original certificate, cuff links and an iPad in a Patek Philippe leather case. The watch itself remains in its plastic wrapping; the action star has never worn it.\n\nSotheby's has assigned Stallone's Grandmaster Chime an estimate of $2.5 million to $5 million, though it could certainly go for more.\n\nThat watch joins other sought-after Patek Philippes, as well as watches from Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Rolex and Piaget. A group of Panerai watches, including the one Stallone wore in the film Expendables 2, round out the collection, which will sell as part of the Sotheby's Important Watches sale in New York City.\n\nRead more: Thirteen Cool Things About the Most Complicated Watch Ever Made\n\nStallone, now 77, says he's owned the watch long enough and it's time to move on. He is a longtime watch collector who at one point owned around 100 timepieces. \"I've been a client and enthusiast of Patek Philippe for many years,\" he tells Bloomberg. \"When I look back on my time with Patek and the watches I've collected, I feel a sense of pride. There's this feeling that I've made it. \"\n\nAccording to Stallone, he bought the Grandmaster Chime as a collector with no intention to wear it. He says the watch was not easy to come by; he had to appeal to the highest levels at the company to be allocated one. He likens the timepiece to a Monet -- a work of art -- and says letting it go is \"bittersweet.\"\n\n\"When you have a great watch and it grows in popularity,\" he says, \"it's a constant reminder that hard work pays off.\"\n\nTwo highly coveted Nautilus models are in the sale, too. A 2021 stainless steel reference 5711/13000A-001, with a green sunburst dial and diamonds on the bezel, is estimated to sell for $200,000 to $400,000 for its extreme rarity. A steel blue-dial reference 5711/1A-001 is estimated to sell in a range of $50,000 to $100,000. The 5711 line has been discontinued, causing its values on the secondary market to soar.\n\nStallone also has a longstanding relationship with Panerai, the maker of thick dive watches that is owned by Swiss luxury juggernaut Richemont. After the actor wore one in the 1994 film Daylight, the company experienced a boost in public interest. \"But for Sylvester Stallone, Panerai wouldn't be what it it is today,\" says Geoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches for the Americas. \"I'm not sure we'd even know about Panerai.\"\n\nStallone's friend Arnold Schwarzenegger then began wearing Panerai, and Stallone went on to wear a Panerai Bronzo in the film Expendables 2; he can be seen wearing it in the poster. According to Hess, he gave Bronzos to key fellow cast members including Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Liam Hemsworth, Chuck Norris and Schwarzenegger.\n\n\"I always thought the bronze PAM00382 Luminor was incredible, because of the metal,\" Stallone says. \"Its design reminds me of the Titanic -- a porthole -- and has this industrial feel. I knew I had to wear it in the movie, because it was going to make such a statement.\"\n\nThe one he's selling is numbered 000, \"so it's likely the first one Panerai ever made,\" he adds. \"I put this thing through its paces -- underwater, above water, in the sand, fight scenes -- you name it. It was my companion throughout that film and longer than that. I've derived so much pleasure from this watch. And now, why not have someone else enjoy it as much as I did?\"\n\nOther watches in the group include an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Tourbillon 50th Anniversary that's estimated in the range of $100,000 to $200,000 and a pink gold Rolex Day-Date for $25,000 to $50,000.\n\nSotheby's Hess managed to land the sale because of a yearslong relationship with Stallone. When Hess was at rival auction house Phillips, he worked with the actor in 2020 on a sale of five watches, including that Daylight Panerai. He also says a distant tie stretches all the way back to Hess's childhood.\n\n\"If you look at the credits at the end of every Rocky movie, they say: 'This film is dedicated to the enduring memory of Jane Oliver,'\" Hess says. Oliver was Stallone's first manager in the late 1970s -- and Hess's cousin. \"She gave me an autographed picture that says 'To Geoffrey from Sly,' he says. \"I've had it for 47 years.\"\n\nHess connected with Stallone in 2019, and they began working together. He knew Stallone had the Grandmaster Chime, and together they worked out the right time to sell it. \"I'm gearing up for what I hope could be a record for a modern watch\" at a non-charity auction, Hess says. \"We're certainly shooting for a record for a watch from the 21st century.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Expendables 2", "body": "Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone has put a selection of his watches up for auction including the exact model he wore during action movie The Expendables 2.\n\nStallone's collection, which spans more than 20 years, includes a Panerai Luminor Submersible 1950 PAM00382 - a model that was also worn by Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Terry Crews and Randy Couture in the 2012 action film.\n\nThe Rocky star, 77, said it was \"bittersweet\" to sell 11 of his timepieces but added that \"they serve as a reminder that hard work pays off\".\n\nThe auction's headliner is a Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300 which is expected to fetch between 2.5 and five million dollars (\u00a31.99 million and \u00a33.97 million).\n\nThe watch, unveiled in 2014, was designed to be Patek Philippe's most intricate and complicated wristwatch in the company's history and comprises 20 complications, including five chiming modes, a reversible case, two independent dials and six patented innovations.\n\nStallone's Grandmaster Chime comes in its single sealed casing with a presentation box engraved with Stallone's name as well as a certificate of origin confirming him as the original purchaser.\n\nThe lot also includes, among other things, product literature, a collection book, travel case, cufflinks, USB drive, and an Apple iPad with a leather case.\n\nElsewhere, Stallone's Patek Philippe Nautilus 5711/1300A-001 is estimated to fetch between 200,000 and 400,000 dollars (\u00a3159,000 and \u00a3318,000).\n\nThere is also an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Tourbillon 50th Anniversary watch which could fetch between 100,000 to 200,000 dollars (\u00a379,500 to \u00a3159,000).\n\nThe Panerai Luminor Submersible, dubbed \"Bronzo\", is estimated to sell for between 30,000 to 60,000 dollars (\u00a323,860 to \u00a347,720) and is accompanied by a signed movie poster of The Expendables 2.\n\nStallone said: \"I've had the privilege of owning some truly remarkable watches over the years, each with its own unique character and history.\n\n\"I enjoy the collecting process like so many others in this passionate community, who don't just see watches as an accessory, but admire them for their history, craftsmanship, artistry - but most importantly - how they make them feel.\n\n\"Looking at these watches, I feel truly lucky to have owned them; they serve as a reminder that hard work pays off.\n\n\"While parting ways with this collection is bittersweet, I cherish that I've owned them with pride, and hope they will be appreciated and admired in their next homes.\"\n\nGeoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches, Americas said: \"While many recognise Stallone as the legendary actor behind characters like Rocky Balboa and John Rambo, watch enthusiasts know the legendary actor to be a noteworthy, influential and truly passionate collector.\n\n\"Each watch in this collection is imbued with his appreciation for fine craftsmanship and artistry; from the intricate mastery of a Patek complication, to the unexpected elegance of a piece-unique Panerai.\n\n\"Not only does Sly's collection offer discerning collectors the chance to acquire a rare work of horology, but one which has been handpicked and cherished by an American icon as well.\n\n\"It's particularly thrilling to bring the astonishing Patek Grandmaster Chime, one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world, to the rostrum at Sotheby's.\n\n\"With Sly being a personal friend, the opportunity to work with him and present this part of his collection to market is a privilege that eclipses virtually any watch project I've worked on in my career.\"\n\nStallone's collection is headlining Sotheby's Important Watches auction, taking place in New York on June 5.", "source": {"uri":

At the Only Watch charitable auction in 2019, a steel model sold for $31 million, setting a record.\n\nStallone's version of the two-sided timepiece, with its 20 complications -- the most Patek has ever put in a wristwatch -- is in white gold. It has five different chiming modes, features a perpetual calendar and can track two time zones. The watch is so rare, even for the vaunted Swiss watchmaker, that it comes with an elaborate presentation box that includes a collection book and plaque, both with Stallone's name, an original certificate, cuff links and an iPad in a Patek Philippe leather case. The watch itself remains in its plastic wrapping; the action star has never worn it.\n\nSotheby's has assigned Stallone's Grandmaster Chime an estimate of $2.5 million to $5 million, though it could certainly go for more.\n\nThat watch joins other sought-after Patek Philippes, as well as watches from Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Rolex and Piaget. A group of Panerai watches, including the one Stallone wore in the film Expendables 2, round out the collection, which will sell as part of the Sotheby's Important Watches sale in New York City.\n\nRead more: Thirteen Cool Things About the Most Complicated Watch Ever Made\n\nStallone, now 77, says he's owned the watch long enough and it's time to move on. He is a longtime watch collector who at one point owned around 100 timepieces. \"I've been a client and enthusiast of Patek Philippe for many years,\" he tells Bloomberg. \"When I look back on my time with Patek and the watches I've collected, I feel a sense of pride. There's this feeling that I've made it. \"\n\nAccording to Stallone, he bought the Grandmaster Chime as a collector with no intention to wear it. He says the watch was not easy to come by; he had to appeal to the highest levels at the company to be allocated one. He likens the timepiece to a Monet -- a work of art -- and says letting it go is \"bittersweet.\"\n\n\"When you have a great watch and it grows in popularity,\" he says, \"it's a constant reminder that hard work pays off.\"\n\nTwo highly coveted Nautilus models are in the sale, too. A 2021 stainless steel reference 5711/13000A-001, with a green sunburst dial and diamonds on the bezel, is estimated to sell for $200,000 to $400,000 for its extreme rarity. A steel blue-dial reference 5711/1A-001 is estimated to sell in a range of $50,000 to $100,000. The 5711 line has been discontinued, causing its values on the secondary market to soar.\n\nStallone also has a longstanding relationship with Panerai, the maker of thick dive watches that is owned by Swiss luxury juggernaut Richemont. After the actor wore one in the 1994 film Daylight, the company experienced a boost in public interest. \"But for Sylvester Stallone, Panerai wouldn't be what it it is today,\" says Geoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches for the Americas. \"I'm not sure we'd even know about Panerai.\"\n\nStallone's friend Arnold Schwarzenegger then began wearing Panerai, and Stallone went on to wear a Panerai Bronzo in the film Expendables 2; he can be seen wearing it in the poster. According to Hess, he gave Bronzos to key fellow cast members including Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Liam Hemsworth, Chuck Norris and Schwarzenegger.\n\n\"I always thought the bronze PAM00382 Luminor was incredible, because of the metal,\" Stallone says. \"Its design reminds me of the Titanic -- a porthole -- and has this industrial feel. I knew I had to wear it in the movie, because it was going to make such a statement.\"\n\nThe one he's selling is numbered 000, \"so it's likely the first one Panerai ever made,\" he adds. \"I put this thing through its paces -- underwater, above water, in the sand, fight scenes -- you name it. It was my companion throughout that film and longer than that. I've derived so much pleasure from this watch. And now, why not have someone else enjoy it as much as I did?\"\n\nOther watches in the group include an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Tourbillon 50th Anniversary that's estimated in the range of $100,000 to $200,000 and a pink gold Rolex Day-Date for $25,000 to $50,000.\n\nSotheby's Hess managed to land the sale because of a yearslong relationship with Stallone. When Hess was at rival auction house Phillips, he worked with the actor in 2020 on a sale of five watches, including that Daylight Panerai. He also says a distant tie stretches all the way back to Hess's childhood.\n\n\"If you look at the credits at the end of every Rocky movie, they say: 'This film is dedicated to the enduring memory of Jane Oliver,'\" Hess says. Oliver was Stallone's first manager in the late 1970s -- and Hess's cousin. \"She gave me an autographed picture that says 'To Geoffrey from Sly,' he says. \"I've had it for 47 years.\"\n\nHess connected with Stallone in 2019, and they began working together. He knew Stallone had the Grandmaster Chime, and together they worked out the right time to sell it. \"I'm gearing up for what I hope could be a record for a modern watch\" at a non-charity auction, Hess says. \"We're certainly shooting for a record for a watch from the 21st century.\"\n\nCopyright Bloomberg\n\nTags : Luxury Watches Events", "source": {"uri": "il.fashionnetwork.com", "dataType":

But despite his well-known love of wristwatches, one of the rarest models in the Rocky star's collection -- a Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime -- has until now remained a secret.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter Sign Up\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a rel=\"nofollow noreferer\" href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

The sale will mark only the second time a Grandmaster Chime has appeared at auction, following a $31 million sale at a charitable Christie's auction in 2019 that made it the most expensive timepiece ever sold.\n\n\"It's particularly thrilling to bring the astonishing Patek Grandmaster Chime, one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world, to the rostrum at Sotheby's,\" said Geoff Hess, Sotheby's head of watches for the Americas, in a statement. The watch has its origins in 2007, when the company's former president Philippe Stern launched a project to create the most intricate watch in Patek Philippe's history. Originally unveiled in 2014 to commemorate the watchmaker's 175th anniversary, the edition became part of the company's permanent collection two years later.\n\nSEE ALSO: Here's What's Leading Next Week's 20th- and 21st-Century Evening Sales at Christie's\n\nIts twenty complications include five chiming mechanisms, including a Grande Sonnerie and audible date repeater controlled by a perpetual calendar. The model's development, production and assembly took over 100,000 hours, according to Sotheby's. The magnificent timepiece will be offered with a presentation box engraved with Stallone's name and coordinating items including cufflinks, a USB drive, and an Apple iPad and earpods in Patek Philippe cases.\n\nIt isn't the only Patek Philippe wristwatch in Stallone's collection. Sotheby's is also set to auction off a Patek Philippe 5711 Nautilus with thirty-two baguette diamonds and a sunburst olive-green dial. The exclusive model, which was distributed only to VIP and \"VVIP\" Patek Philippe clients, is expected to fetch between $200,000 and $400,000.\n\nSylvester Stallone's impact on the world of luxury watches\n\nWhile Stallone has collected watches for decades, his affinity for Panerai inspired one of the actor's contributions to the watch industry. Stallone claims to have become interested in the company during the filming of the 1996 movie Daylight, after which he requested Panerai create a model for him to wear in the film. His collaborations with the brand have since resulted in the creation of numerous limited-edition SLYTECH models that take their name from the actor's \"Sly\" nickname.\n\nTwo Panerai models will be offered up from Stallone's collection next month, including a bronze PAM00382 Luminor Submersible seen on the actor in the 2011 film The Expendables 2 and a PAM00269 Luminor Submersible with a yellow gold case and black dial created especially for Stallone in 2006. Both watches have estimates of $30,000 to $60,000.\n\nStallone will also sell timepieces from Audemars Piguet, Piaget and Cartier. His 2016 Rolex Day-Date is expected to fetch between $25,000 and $50,000. That engraved pink gold watch was created to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the model, which was the first to display days and dates separately on a dial and is commonly referred to as \"The President\" due to Lyndon B. Johnson's affinity for the style.\n\nThe actor has previously sold portions of his watch collection at Phillips, auctioning four Richard Mille models and a Panerai in 2020 for a total of $3.1 million. Sotheby's will offer Stallone's watches in its June 5 Important Watches sale in New York, which is expected to realize a total of $3 million to $6 million.\n\n\"I enjoy the collecting process like so many others in this passionate community, who don't just see watches as an accessory, but admire them for their history, craftmanship, artistry -- but most importantly -- how they make them feel,\" said Stallone in a statement. \"While parting ways with this collection is bittersweet, I cherish that I've owned them with pride, and hope they will be appreciated and admired in their next homes.\"", "source": {"uri": "observer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_tremayne_pengelly@observer.com", "name": "Alexandra Tremayne-Pengelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patek_Philippe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patek Philippe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sotheby's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panerai", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Panerai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christie's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Nautilus_(SSN-571)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USS Nautilus (SSN-571)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perpetual calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater_(horology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repeater (horology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stern (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watchmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cufflink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cufflink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USB flash drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget_SA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piaget SA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mille", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Mille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audemars_Piguet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audemars Piguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartier_(jeweler)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cartier (jeweler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

complicated wristwatches in the world, to the rostrum at Sotheby's.\n\n\"With Sly being a personal friend, the opportunity to work with him and present this part of his collection to market is a privilege that eclipses virtually any watch project I've worked on in my career.\"\n\nStallone's collection is headlining Sotheby's Important Watches auction, taking place in New York on June 5.",

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nSylvester Stallone is one of the most influential watch collectors of the last 30 years. In the mid-'90s, he fell in love with Panerai, collaborated with the brand, and started giving its big-boy timepieces away to friends you may have heard of like Arnold Schwarzenegger. (How Stallone first got introduced to Panerai is a matter of great contention!) Now, Stallone is auctioning off 11 pieces from his collection through Sotheby's in June. While there are watches included in the sale that we've seen the action star wear in movies like The Expendables 2, the crown jewel of this auction has been hidden from view until today.\n\nFor the first time, a Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime 6300 is coming up for sale. (Sorta: a version Patek created specially for the charity auction Only Watch sold in 2019. More on that in a bit.) Stallone never actually wore this watch and it's still sealed in its original packaging. Patek's 6300 is already a holy grail watch, one of the maker's most complicated pieces. You've seen variations of it on the wrist of Jay-Z or setting records for the most expensive watch ever sold at $31 million back in 2019. Stallone's watch is a 6300G-010 made of white gold. The watch really earns its Grandmaster Chime name with the ability to go Gong Mode in five different ways, including a grande sonnerie, petite sonnerie, and an alarm.\n\nThe specs of the 6300 are impressive, but what's fun about this auction is that it reveals what customers like Stallone get with the watch. The Grandmaster Chime also comes with an equally grand presentation box that's engraved with Stallone's name. Stallone's name also appears on a \"Grandmaster Chime book\" and a certificate of origin. Also included in the package: \"travel case, cufflinks, USB drive, sealed setting pin, hang tag, an Apple iPad with a Patek Philippe leather case, adapter, charger, and Apple earpods with a Patek Philippe case.\" I need a PP AirPods case.

Sotheby's said it is \"widely considered a 'holy grail' amongst the watch community.\" Publicly, no one knew Stallone owned the watch as he has never worn it. In fact, it has never been removed from its sealed plastic casing.\n\nThe Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175 with its distinctive hand-engraved yellow gold case was unveiled as a limited-edition in 2014 to commemorate Patek Philippe's 175th anniversary. It later joined Patek's permanent collection in 2016 as the reference 6300, making it the company's most complex and first grande-sonnerie wristwatch added to the company's collection. It features a reversible white gold case adorned with Patek Philippe's signature hobnail pattern. The development, production and assembly of the timepiece took 100,000 hours.\n\nThe movement of the Grandmaster Chime has no fewer than 20 complications: a grande and petite sonnerie, minute repeater, alarm with time strike, date repeater, second time zone with day-night indicator, strikework mode display, strikework isolator display, alarm on-off indicator, crown position indicator and power reserve indicators for the movement and the strikework. The instantaneous perpetual calendar alone consists of a date on both sides, day of week, month, leap-year cycle, four-digit year display, 24-hour and minute subdial, and moon phases.\n\nThe complications are revealed on both sides of the timepiece, easily reversable. It can be worn on either side.\n\nAs mentioned, the watch is in its original single sealed casing. It is accompanied by a presentation box engraved with Stallone's name and a Grandmaster Chime book bearing his name on the cover and inside cover. The lot also includes a certificate of origin confirming Stallone as the original purchaser, product literature in a large leather portfolio, a collection book, travel case, cufflinks, USB drive, sealed setting pin, hang tag, an Apple iPad with a Patek Philippe leather case, adapter, charger and Apple earpods with a Patek Philippe case.\n\nGeoff Hess, Sotheby's head of Watches, said the timepiece is \"one of the most complicated wristwatches in the world.... With Sly being a personal friend, the opportunity to work with him and present this part of his collection to market is a privilege that eclipses virtually any watch project I've worked on in my career.\"\n\nThe other 10 watches in the collection consists of three other Patek Philippe watches, four Panerai models, and timepieces by Audemars Piguet, Rolex, Cartier and Piaget. Highlights of the sale are as follows.\n\nThe Patek Philippe Nautilus is as the one of Patek Philippe's most popular models and is recognized as one of the most important luxury sports watches in history.\n\nThe 2021 stainless steel Nautilus reference 5711/1300A-001 has the highly sought-after \"sunburst olive-green\" dial within the Nautilus line. Its bezel is adorned with 32 baguette diamonds, marking Patek's first gem-set stainless steel 5711.\n\nProduced for only a brief period, the stainless steel and diamond reference 5711/1300A-001 is the most exclusive of all modern Nautilus, according to Sotheby's. It was distributed to its best clients. It's only the second time this model has been made available on the open market.\n\nIts estimate is $200,000 to $400,000.\n\nThis example of the legendary Royal Oak sports watch has an automatic flying tourbillon movement created for the 50th anniversary of the Royal Oak in 2022. The watch is housed in a pink gold case revealing a smoked blue dial with a grande tapisserie pattern. The movement also features a special gold rotor with a '50 Years' logo.\n\nIts estimate is $100,000 to $200,000.\n\nLaunched in 2011, the PAM 382 \"Bronzo\" by Panerai, limited to 1,000 pieces, has a 47mm case and green dial. It was the first Panerai watch crafted entirely of bronze. The entire edition quickly sold out, the auction house said. The watch is numbered N0000/1000 - suggesting it could be the first piece made in this limited-edition series. It was worn by Stallone in the film \"The Expendables 2,\" the same year the model was released. The same model was worn by several actors in the film, including Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Terry Crews and Randy Couture. The watch is also accompanied by a signed movie poster of \"The Expendables 2.\"\n\nIts estimate is $30,000 - $60,000.\n\nStallone's longtime association with Panerai helped propel the brand to international recognition. When he wore the Panerai reference 5218-201/a in the 1996 film, \"Daylight,\" it resulted in the creation of two new watch models, with the moniker \"Sly Tech\" on the dial along with Stallone's signature on the caseback.\n\nStallone continued his collaboration with Panerai, with several limited edition \"SLYTECH\" models. The reference PAM00269 stands out as a unique piece made exclusively for him. Produced in 2006, this Luminor Submersible Chronograph has a 47mm yellow gold case and black dial. The caseback has the engravings, \"Special Edition for SLY\" and \"Esemplare Unico.\"\n\nIts estimate is $30,000 to $60,000.\n\nIn 2016, Rolex marked the 60th anniversary of the Day-Date timepiece with the reference 22823. Encased in elegant pink gold, it has quintessential Rolex features: applied Roman numerals, a fluted bezel and a president bracelet. What sets this watch apart is its dial in Rolex's hallmark dark green color. This piece bears the nickname \"Sly\" engraved on the caseback.\n\nIts estimate is $25,000 to $50,000.\n\n\"I enjoy the collecting process,\" Stallone said in a statement. \"Like so many others in this passionate community, who don't just see watches as an accessory, but admire them for their history, craftsmanship, artistry - but most importantly - how they make them feel.\"\n\nThe other

Apparently one of the answers to that question involves luxury watches. Stallone, it turns out, is a watch guy -- and a selection of 11 timepieces from his collection will be at the heart of Sotheby's Important Watches auction, to be held on June 5 in New York City.\n\n\"Each watch in this collection is imbued with [Stallone's] appreciation for fine craftsmanship and artistry; from the intricate mastery of a Patek complication, to the unexpected elegance of a piece-unique Panerai,\" said Geoff Hess, Sotheby's Head of Watches, Americas in a statement. \"Not only does Sly's collection offer discerning collectors the chance to acquire a rare work of horology, but one which has been handpicked and cherished by an American icon as well.\"\n\nThe auction won't just be notable for the star power factor. One of the watches that'll be part of it is a Patek Philippe Reference 6300G Grandmaster Chime. Sotheby's notes that this will be the first time such a watch is made available at auction. The auction house estimates that it will sell for between $2.5 and $5 million.\n\nFor his part, Stallone took a philosophical stance regarding the sale of his watches. \"I enjoy the collecting process like so many others in this passionate community, who don't just see watches as an accessory, but admire them for their history, craftsmanship, artistry -- but most importantly -- how they make them feel,\" he said. \"Looking at these watches, I feel truly lucky to have owned them; they serve as a reminder that hard work pays off.

Stallone wore the watch in question in the film Expendables 2, and the timepiece's weathered bronze exterior is certainly photogenic. This one's expected to sell for between $30,000 and $60,000.\n\nAnd if you're remotely curious about whether Stallone will bring up watches in his forthcoming memoir, you won't have that much longer to wait; it's set for publication next year.", "source": {"uri": "insidehook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideHook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sotheby's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patek_Philippe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patek Philippe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sylvester-Stallone-Patek-Philippe-Grandmaster-Chime.jpg?resize=1200,800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543336", "eventUri": "eng-9543336", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 454}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Submersible 1950 PAM00382 - a model that was also worn by Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Terry Crews and Randy Couture in the 2012 action film.\n\nThe Rocky star, 77, said it was \"bittersweet\" to

The first example to appear at auction, the watch boasts 20 complications spread across two dials, with five chiming mechanisms, including a groundbreaking date repeater controlled by the perpetual calendar, a Grande Sonnerie, and an alarm feature. An invisible reversing mechanism makes it easy to flip the 47.7 mm white gold case around to view either dial. The watch arrives in a sealed bag (it's never been worn) with a ton of accessories, including a presentation box engraved with Sylvester Stallone's name, a Certificate of Origin dated December 15, 2021, a Grandmaster Chime book stamped with the actor's name, a Collection book, a travel case, cufflinks, a sealed setting pin and hang tag, an iPad and AirPods in leather cases, and a personally signed handwritten note from Sly.", "source": {"uri": "uncrate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Uncrate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patek_Philippe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patek Philippe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_(chess)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grandmaster (chess)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_calendar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perpetual calendar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundbreaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundbreaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repeater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sylvester Stallone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars_and_Timekeeping", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Calendars and Timekeeping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Supplies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Living_History", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Living History", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://uncrate.com/p/2024/05/sly-stallone-patek-grandmaster-chime.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543336", "eventUri": "eng-9543336", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-12-", "textStart": 660, "textEnd": 671}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

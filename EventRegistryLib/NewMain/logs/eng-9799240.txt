This is certainly what the Prime Minister will be thinking today, but his new good friend the King could well have exactly the same perspective on the situation, too.\n\nThe King initially commented on the stabbings, expressing his horror at the 'utterly horrific' atrocity - 'We send our most heartfelt condolences, prayers and deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have so tragically lost their lives, and to all those affected by this truly appalling attack'. But since then, as rioting has spread all over the country that he rules, he has been conspicuously silent. Is this the right approach, or should the King have come forward and offered a strong statement of condemnation?\n\nThose who are defending Charles's apparent dithering in the face of civil unrest point to the fact that, when Britain was last engulfed in riots in 2011, his mother did not offer any public comment, waiting instead for the violence to die down before matters could resume as usual. Yet Britain in 2024 is a different place to how it was thirteen years ago, and not just because we now have a Labour government and a new King. Back then, while social media and smartphones and the immediate rush of information undoubtedly played a part in people's lives, they were not as all-consuming as they are now; Instagram and WhatsApp, for instance, were in their infancy, and TikTok did not even exist. The famous line about how a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its boots is several times as true now as it was back then.\n\nNobody is expecting the King to be on hand to offer public statements on every single minor news development. It would be beneath any understanding of royal dignity to turn the monarch into an all-purpose commentator, a rent-a-quote who can be called upon to add a line or two to any opportunistic writer's story.\n\nYet there is also the question of whether holding oneself above everyday concerns can lead to an Olympian detachment that is a very poor look for the monarchy that Charles has, implicitly, suggested that he will rebrand for a new era. Both the Christmas addresses that he has made so far as King have emphasised the difficulties of social cohesion and poverty in Britain. The riots have exposed these issues in the most public and glaring way; it should be down to Charles to address this very serious problem in his country.\n\nIt has been suggested that a combination of his ongoing cancer treatment and a desire not to overshadow the government's efforts to quell the unrest have led to his silence. But he is receiving daily updates and wants to be kept informed as to what is being done about the wider issues around community cohesion and interfaith dialogue. This is all very well, and indeed commendable, but it does not go far enough. A written statement would be welcome, a personal address to the nation even more so.\n\nCharles has, by and large, been a popular King over the past couple of years, and the news of his illness engendered a vast amount of public sympathy. It is surely now time to repay this sympathy with a clear, open and heartfelt expression of solidarity with the law-abiding and a condemnation of the violence that has taken place in his country. Continued silence will only increase republican suggestions that the King holds himself above his people, and it will be that much harder to refute such a claim in the future should he remain apparently aloof from this most pressing of situations.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_larman@spectator.us", "name": "Alexander Larman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_dialogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interfaith dialogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republicanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165115697-e1723112362568.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799240", "eventUri": "eng-9799240", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The juxtaposition between the royal family member relaxing behind palace walls and the rising incidents of violence is unsettling to many of his usually loyal fans.\n\nThe riots have surged as misinformation spread online that the attacker was a Muslim immigrant which has led to a rise in racism and anti-immigrant sentiments. King Charles and Queen Camilla issued an initial statement on July 29 sending their \"heartfelt condolences, prayers, and deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of those who have so tragically lost their lives.\" While claiming to be \"shocked\" by the news, Charles has done little else since -- and the criticism is growing louder.\n\nKate Williams, a professor of public engagement with history at the University of Reading, told the Times Radio that King Charles needs to step up at this crucial moment. \"This would be a moment for the King to talk about multiculturalism, the Commonwealth, people coming together and I think that if I were advising him I would suggest making that statement sooner [rather] than later,\" she suggested. Williams was conscientious of his cancer battle and even said a written statement was better than dead silence from the monarchy.\n\n\"I do think that something should be said on behalf of the royal family, expressing sympathy with those who have lost their livelihoods, those who are living in fear,\" she added. \"Do we need to get to the point where we've got people dying? Because I think that people do look to the monarchy and they do want to know what the monarchy thinks.\" Williams isn't the only public figure asking Charles to stop being so oblivious to the \"crisis times.\"\n\nFormer BBC correspondent Peter Hunt took to his X account to share his dismay at how Charles was handling the volatile situation. \"We have a silent head of state. The palace spin talks of bridge building in private,\" he wrote. \"Charles is meant to be a unifying figure who champions religious tolerance and mutual respect. Yet he's said nothing about racism and rioting. It's an untenable position. If not now, when?\"\n\nThe anti-monarchy sentiment has been rising since the death of Queen Elizabeth II and British taxpayers want to see the royal family pull their weight when it comes to work.

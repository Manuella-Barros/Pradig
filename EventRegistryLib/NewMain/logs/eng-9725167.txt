However, a dispute over agent Kia Joorabchian's colossal commission left the deal in tatters and Ashworth and United stepped in to take their chance.\n\nA switch to Old Trafford now looks inevitable and according to journalist Ben Jacobs, United want to close the deal quickly.\n\n\"United [are] hoping to wrap up a deal for Joshua Zirkzee this week,\" Jacobs said on his X account.\n\n\"Terms and agent commissions finalised. Zirkzee has agreed a five-year contract. Talks with Bologna at an advanced stage.\n\n\"[United] feel Zirkzee compliments Rasmus H\u00f8jlund and can be used as more than just a No.9\"\n\nThere are two key updates in Jacobs' post. First, United's confidence of wrapping this up so quickly, given that the 23 year old's Netherlands were only dumped out of Euro 24 last night by England.\n\nThe second interesting point is that United intend to use the former Bayern Munich man alongside Hojlund rather than rotating them. Given that they both operate centrally, this will lead to some speculation about potential changes in formation from the 4-2-3-1 Ten Hag likes to employ, and/or a new role for Bruno Fernandes, who normally plays in the pocket behind the number nine.\n\nThe only sticking point in the deal would appear to be whether United can agree a figure to pay Bologna over instalments rather than having to pay the whole release clause up front. Talks are understood to be ongoing on this.\n\nMeanwhile, Tuttomercatoweb claims that the Dutchman is already on his way to Old Trafford to complete the deal.\n\n\"Decisive hours for the transfer of Joshua Zirkzee to Manchester United,\" the outlet claims.\n\n\"In these minutes, the English club and Bologna are in contact to define the details of the transfer of the 2001-born footballer who, after the end of the European Championship in Holland, will fly to England to begin his adventure in the Premier League.\"\n\nHolding up the red shirt before he goes on holiday would make a lot of sense for the star and would be an excellent start to United's summer transfer business.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "red_billy@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Red Billy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

The Dutchman is set to 'fly to Manchester' to seal the deal. Ugarte remains a target for Man Utd as they aim to strengthen in midfield before the transfer window closes.\n\nManchester United target and Bologna hotshot Joshua Zirkzee is set to fly to England to finally put pen to paper on a move to Old Trafford, according to Italian publication TuttoMercatoWeb, after a five-year deal was agreed in recent weeks.\n\nRasmus Hojlund, who was signed last summer for \u00a372 million, was Erik ten Hag's go-to guy in the solitary striker berth last season and notched a club-best goal tally of 16 with Bruno Fernandes one goal shy of the Dane's haul.\n\nRelated Man Utd Have Plan for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund\n\nManchester United are currently weighing up their options for centre forward but do believe Zirkzee could work alongside Hojlund.\n\nThat said, the former Ajax chief and his entourage, particularly on the back of Anthony Martial's departure, are looking to strengthen in that department and the 23-year-old emerged as the leading candidate early on in the trading period.\n\nZirkzee Set to Fly to England Deal set to be official in the coming days Close\n\nThe imposing, yet elegant, striker enjoyed a fruitful campaign with the Serie A club, notching 12 goals and seven assists in all competitions. A positive return for the youngster, much of his influence comes from the intangible aspects of his game.\n\nAccording to TuttoMercatoWeb, Zirkzee's move to Manchester United is reaching its end with both parties currently in direct contact, hoping to iron out the finer details of the 2001-born ace's deal in the coming days.\n\nZirkzee, 23, and the Netherlands crashed out of Euro 2024 at the hands of England in the semi-finals and that in itself has sped up the prospective switch.\n\nThe Athletic's David Ornstein recently reported that Manchester United's ability to agree personal terms and Zirkzee's sizeable agent commission meant that a deal has progressed quickly. The journalist suggested that the 13-time Premier League champions are 'working to finalise' the deal.\n\nZirkzee vs Hojlund - 23/24 League Stats\n\nStatistic\n\nZirkzee\n\nHojlund\n\nMinutes\n\n2,772\n\n2,172\n\nGoals\n\n11\n\n10\n\nAssists\n\n4\n\n2\n\nShots per game\n\n2.5\n\n1.3\n\nAerials won per game\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nKey passes per game\n\n1.3\n\n0.9\n\nDribbles per game\n\n1.5\n\n0.6\n\nOverall rating\n\n7.03\n\n6.70\n\nWriting in his Daily Briefing, the ever-reliable Fabrizio Romano revealed that the former Bayern Munich youth prospect's move to England is all 'going to plan' and the intricacies of his contract is the only business remaining.\n\nAC Milan were previously interested in the youngster's signature in the embryonic stages of the summer transfer window but the Serie A club's interest was shelved recently. Now, the reports have suggested that Zirkzee's agent, Kia Joorabchian, is now working tirelessly to seal a deal for his client.\n\nMan Utd Move Closer to Ugarte Agreement Midfielder 'open' to Old Trafford move Close\n\nNot only are Manchester United looking to strengthen in the centre forward department, but with the inevitable departure of Casemiro on the horizon, the Red Devils are keen to find a replacement for the Brazilian before the summer transfer window closes for business.\n\nParis Saint-Germain outcast Manuel Ugarte has been earmarked as the priority target. FootMercato journalist Santi Aouna has suggested that a move for the Uruguay international is progressing positively, with a move coming ever so closer to materialising.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: In the 2022/23 Champions League group stage, Ugarte completed the most tackles and interceptions combined (34), including 12 tackles in a 3-0 away win against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nThe defensive-minded midfielder's maiden season in the French capital didn't go to plan after signing from Sporting CP last summer. Vitinha, Warren Zaire-Emery and the like are ahead of the 23-year-old in the PSG pecking order, but he would put together a compelling case to demand a starting berth at Old Trafford.\n\nAll statistics per WhoScored", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Zirkzee", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Zirkzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bologna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Ugarte_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Ugarte (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelson_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gelson Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Martial", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

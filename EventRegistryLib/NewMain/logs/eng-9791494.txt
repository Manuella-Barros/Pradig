February reports highlighted Iran's provision of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles to Russia, and the U.S. in June indicated an uptick in defense collaboration, including drone provisions for Ukraine strikes -- claims Russia has denied.

(AFP)\n\nSergei Shoigu, a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin arrived in Tehran on Monday for talks with Iranian leaders including the president and top security officials as the Islamic Republic weighs its response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail in Iran last week.\n\nThe US is reportedly concerned that escalating tensions in the Middle East is bringing Russia and Iran closer together after the Ukraine war has already deepened military cooperation between the two countries.\n\nRussia had condemned the assassination and called on all parties to refrain from steps that could tip the Middle East into a wider regional war.\n\nSergei Shoigu, the secretary of Russia's security council, was shown by Russia's Zvezda television station meeting Rear Admiral Ali Akbar Ahmadian, a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander who serves as secretary of the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nShoigu, who was Russia's defence minister before being moved to the security council in May, will also meet President Masoud Pezeshkian, Zvezda said.\n\n\"In Tehran, the secretary of the Russian Security Council is scheduled to meet with the president, the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and the head of the General Staff,\" according to Zvezda TV.\n\nThough Putin has yet to comment in public on the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East, senior Russian officials have said that those behind the killing of Haniyeh were seeking to scuttle any hope of peace in the Middle East and to draw the US into military action.\n\nIran has blamed Israel and said it will \"punish\" it; Israeli officials have not claimed responsibility. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also the Lebanese group Hezbollah whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nReuters reported in February that Iran had provided Russia with a large number of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. The US said in June that Russia appeared to be deepening its defence cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it was using to strike Ukraine, something Moscow denies.\n\nRussia said last Friday it joined Iran in condemning the assassination of the Hamas leader and pointing out \"the extremely dangerous consequences of such actions.\"\n\nWashington said it did not have any expectation that Russia would play a productive role in de-escalating tensions in the region.\n\n\"We haven't seen them play a productive role in this conflict since October 7. They have, for the most part, been absent. Certainly we've seen them do nothing to urge any party to take de-escalatory steps,\" US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a daily briefing.\n\nThe US did not know why exactly Shoigu's trip took place now, Miller said, but said one possibility might have been to further Moscow's relationship with Tehran to seek support for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Certainly we have seen that

Further discussions with Iranian military officials were planned. The visit reflects the growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu visited Iran for talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian and top officials amid mounting tensions over a possible retaliation attack by the Islamic Republic against Israel for the death of a Hamas leader.\n\nShoigu, 68, will also meet with his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Ahmadian and the Chief of the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Mohammad Bagheri, Russia's state-run Tass news service reported.

Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and the Lebanese group Hezbollah whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with the Islamic State.\n\nReuters reported in February that Iran had provided Russia with many powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles. The U.S. said in June that Russia appeared to be deepening its defense cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it was using to strike Ukraine, something Moscow denies.\n\nRussia said last Friday it joined Iran in condemning the assassination of the Hamas leader and pointed out \"the extremely dangerous consequences of such actions.\"\n\nWashington said it did not have any expectation that Russia would play a productive role in de-escalating tensions in the region.\n\n\"We haven't seen them play a productive role in this conflict since October 7. They have, for the most part, been absent. Certainly, we've seen them do nothing to urge any party to take de-escalatory steps,\" U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a daily briefing.\n\nThe U.S. does not know why Shoigu's trip is taking place now, Miller said, but one possibility might be to further Moscow's relationship with Tehran to seek support for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"Certainly, we have seen that with the security relationship between Iran and Russia before,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They have, for the most part, been absent. Certainly we've seen them do nothing to urge any party to take de-escalatory steps,\" US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a daily briefing. The US did not know why exactly Shoigu's trip took place now, Miller said, but said one possibility might have been to further Moscow's relationship with Tehran to seek support for its invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda_(TV_channel)", "type":

Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, who is reportedly planning the military strikes on Israel.\n\nBagheri told Shoigu that Russian-Iranian ties were \"deep, long term and strategic\" and would only expand under Iran's new government, according to the Times, citing Iranian media.\n\nShoigu also met with Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian.\n\n\"We are ready for full cooperation with Iran on regional issues,\" Shoigu said.\n\nIran and Russia have grown closer since the start of the Ukraine war, with Moscow turning to Tehran to provide it with military drones. Russia has launched more than 4,000 Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones against Ukraine, according to The Wall Street Journal in May.\n\nMoscow now manufactures Iranian-designed drones within its borders at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in the Russian steppes.\n\n\"If Iranians are asking Russians for air defense, they are cashing in their chips,\" Colin Clarke, director of policy and research at Soufan Group, an intelligence consulting firm, told the Times.\n\n\"The question is how do Russians assuage Tehran without ruining their relationship with Israel,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Monday convened his national-security team in the White House Situation Room, where he was told that the timing and nature of Iran's and Hezbollah's planned attack on Israel is unclear, according to news site Axios.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from the G7 countries on Sunday that Iran and Hezbollah could attack Israel in the next 24 to 48

to discuss strengthening bilateral cooperation in a wide range of spheres including security, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported.\n\nThe visit was on the invitation of his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Iran's local Tasnim news agency reported.\n\nIt said the visit had the aim of 'strengthening interactions, the examination of regional and international issues, and bilateral political security relations'.\n\nRussia has 'strongly condemned' the killing of Haniyeh, the political leader of the Islamist Palestinian movement Hamas, in Tehran last month.\n\nPezeshkian has described Russia as a 'valued strategic ally'.\n\nShoigu was removed as defence minister in May in a major shake-up of Russia's military leadership, becoming secretary of the Security Council instead.\n\nThe visit to one of Russia's key political allies underlines Shoigu's continued significant role.\n\nAs defence minister, he visited Iran in September last year, while his predecessor at the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, a longstanding ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, visited in late 2022.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net",

The visit comes after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which Russia condemns. Amid these developments, Russia continues to deepen its defense cooperation with Iran, raising international concerns.\n\nIn a significant diplomatic move, a senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Tehran on Monday for high-stakes discussions with Iranian leaders.

He was dismissed in May this year and moved to lead Russia's Security Council.\n\nOn July 31, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Hamas group in Palestine, was killed in Tehran alongside his bodyguard. While it is assumed that Jerusalem was to be behind the assassination, there is disagreement as to how it was achieved. Some believe it was a long-range missile, a projectile fired at close range or even a bomb hidden in his apartment. Israel has yet to provide an official comment on the incident.\n\nIran has no doubt, on Monday, Tehran maintained that it has the \"legal right\" to \"punish the Zionist regime\" in response to Haniyeh's assassination, which took place when Haniyeh visited Tehran for the new Iranian president's inauguration, though it also stated that Tehran \"does not seek to aggravate tensions in the region.\"\n\nThree American and Israeli officials told Axios that Iran's expected retaliatory strike against Israel is expected to take place on Monday, August 5, and is likely to be on an even more extensive scale than the April 13 attack and could involve participation by Iranian-backed Hezbollah from Lebanon and Houthi rebels from Yemen.\n\nIn response to the situation, Washington deployed an aircraft carrier strike group, a squadron of F-22 Raptor fighter jets, and additional warships to the Middle East.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"},

The United States said in June that Russia appeared to be deepening its defence cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it was using to strike Ukraine, something Moscow denies.\n\nRussia said last Friday that it joined Iran in condemning the assassination of the Hamas leader and pointing out \"the extremely dangerous consequences of such actions\".\n\n(Writing

Iran has officially blamed Israel for Haniyeh's death and said it would \"avenge\" his death.\n\nThe visit, at the invitation of Ali Akbar Ahmadian, secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, aims to strengthen bilateral relations and discuss regional and international issues, according to Iran's ISNA news agency.\n\nShoigu is scheduled to meet with senior Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian, during his stay.\n\nThe trip underscores the growing strategic cooperation between Iran and Russia, two countries facing Western sanctions and sharing increasingly close ties in recent years.\n\nKey points of discussion are expected to include bilateral political and security relations, regional security issues, potentially including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and economic cooperation in the face of international sanctions.\n\nNeither Iranian nor Russian officials have released details about the length of Shoigu's stay or specific agenda items for the talks.\n\nThe Russian official's visit comes hours after Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi, who was believed to have relayed a message from the US over Iran's potential retaliation against Israel.\n\n\"The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh as a religious thinker, memorizer of the Qur'an, prominent politician of the Arab world, a great Palestinian figure, and a great mujahid of Islamic resistance, is an act against all standards of international law and custom,\" Iran's acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri Kani said at his meeting with his Jordanian counterpart.\n\nRussia and Iran specialist Nicole Bayat Grajewski said on X.com that \"Shoigu will not only meet with Ahmadian but also chief of the Iranian General Staff Bagheri and President Pezeshkian, Patrushev wouldn't always meet with military officials in his trips to Iran but Shoigu and Bagheri have a pretty extensive track record of working together.\"\n\nRussia's Izvestia regional expert Andrey Ontikov said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu may be driving the escalation with Iran.\n\n\"If Netanyahu stops his operation in the Gaza Strip now, an investigation will begin into why the Hamas attack on 7 October [2023] happened. Netanyahu risks not only losing his post as prime minister but also ending up behind bars,\" Ontikov told Russian media. Netanyahu has been blamed for Israel's lack of preparedness for the Hamas attack; he is also facing longstanding corruption charges.\n\nThe expert added Iran is seeking a measured response to Haniyeh's killing. \"Iran is now actively contacting various parties through intermediaries and developing a formula for a retaliatory reaction that will allow Tehran to save face,\" he said.\n\nOntikov cautioned against expectations of a swift resolution to regional conflicts, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to imagine that a solution will be found in the coming years. This problem has existed for decades, and they can't seem to resolve it. The fact is that it's a religious conflict,\" he noted.", "source": {"uri": "intellinews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Intellinews                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Iran has provided Russia with military drones, and the two countries recently finalised an agreement to expand their military and intelligence cooperation.\" The New York Times emphasised.\n\nIranian state television showed Shoigu and General Bagheri greeting each other, meeting face-to-face and then participating in a bigger meeting at a negotiation table with members of the Russian delegation and Iranian military officials.\n\n\"We are ready for full cooperation with Iran on regional issues,\" Shoigu said (according to Iranian state media).\n\nGeneral Bagheri told Shoigu that relations between their countries are \"deep, long-term and strategic\" and that they will only expand under the new Iranian government.\n\nThe New York Times noted that Russia also has economic and cultural ties with Israel, as a large number of Russian Jews live there.

Sergei Shoigu, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was shown on the Russian Ministry of Defense-controlled Zvezda TV channel meeting Rear Adm. Ali Akbar Ahmadian, a senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander who serves as secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security Council. The channel reported that Shoigu would also meet with newly inaugurated Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nShoigu landed in Tehran less than a week after the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh as the latter was visiting the Iranian capital for Pezeshkian's inauguration ceremony. Russia said it \"strongly condemned\" Haniyeh's killing, while Pezeshkian described Russia as a \"valued strategic ally.\" Military cooperation between the Moscow regime and the Islamic Republic has been significantly boosted over the last two years, following Russia's aggression against Ukraine. In February, Reuters reported that Iran had delivered surface-to-surface ballistic missiles to Russia, while in June, the United States stated that Iran had sent the Russians \"hundreds\" of the attack drones that have previously been used to devastating effect in Ukraine since the February 2022 invasion.\n\n\"Putin's goal is clear. He wants to reshape the new global order and undermine the West. To accomplish this strategy, he needs chaos in the Middle East, and Iran, as Russia's proxy, is assisting. Shoigu's goal in Tehran is to strengthen security relations so that Iran can escalate and Moscow can later blackmail the West into navigating negotiations through the Kremlin if they want to de-escalate the conflict.\" -- Ivana Stradner, FDD Research Fellow\n\n\"The partnership between Khamenei's Islamic Republic and Putin's Russia is deeply entrenched in their ideological opposition to the U.S.-centric international order. In light of the conflict in Ukraine, Russia perceives the emergence of a new theater in the Middle East as an opportunity to expand its influence in the region while simultaneously redirecting attention away from the Ukrainian front.\" -- Saeed Ghasseminejad, Senior Iran and Financial Economics Advisor\n\nAccording to the Moscow Times, \"the visit to one of Russia's key political allies underlines Shoigu's continued significant role.\" While serving as Russia's defense minister -- a post he was removed from during a major leadership shake-up orchestrated by Putin in May -- Shoigu met with top Iranian leaders. On the fringes of last April's summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization -- whose members include Russia, India, China, Iran, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan -- Shoigu and his Iranian counterpart discussed enhanced security ties, with Shoigu reportedly highlighting a significant increase in military contracts between Tehran and Moscow.\n\nResponding to Shoigu's current visit to Iran, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that Washington had no expectations that Moscow would play a positive role in reducing regional tensions. \"We haven't seen them play a productive role in this conflict since [the Hamas atrocities of] October 7. They have, for the most part, been absent. Certainly, we've seen them do nothing to urge any party to take de-escalatory steps,\" Miller said.\n\n\"Russia and Iran Agree to Deepen Security Ties,\" FDD Flash Brief\n\n\"Congress Seeks Answers on

The two countries are trying to create a multipolar world and ensure the security of the region\".\n\n\"The relations between the two countries are growing in all sectors and have good prospects, the Russian official added.\n\nRussia has strongly condemned the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31.\n\nOn August 1, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov labeled the killing of Haniyeh as unacceptable and warned of its potentially grave consequences.\n\nFollowing the assassination, Israel has heightened its state of alert, increasing security measures around its forces and critical infrastructure in anticipation of potential retaliation from Iran.\n\nThe Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned ambassadors and diplomatic mission heads in Tehran for a meeting with acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani, during which Iran's commitment to responding to Israel was reaffirmed.\n\nIsrael Under Fire - Hezbollah's Drone Attack Injures Israeli Soldiers\n\nIranian Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said that Tehran \"seeks to establish stability in the region, but this will not be achieved unless the aggressor is punished and the Zionist regime is deterred from further provocations.\" He added that Tehran's response is inevitable.\n\nKanaani also urged the United States to cease its support for Israel, criticizing the international community for failing to protect regional stability and calling for support in \"punishing the aggressor.\"", "source": {"uri": "palestinechronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Palestine Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

According to the New York Times Tehran took the opportunity presented by this week's visit of Sergei Shoigu secretary of Russia's Security Council to provide much needed advanced air defense systems as the likelihood of war with Israel escalates.\n\nShoigu met with newly elected President Masoud Pezeshkian, Secretary of Iran's National Security Council, Ali Akbar Ahmadian as well as Chief of the General Staff General Mohammad Bagheri, who is believed to be in charge of plans for attacks on Israel.\n\nFollowing the meetings, Shoigu said that Russia is \"ready for full cooperation with Iran on regional issues,\" while Bagheri saidd relations between the countries were \"deep, long-term and strategic,\" adding that they will only expand under Iran's new leadership.\n\nAccording to the NYT, citing two Iranian officials familiar with military planning including a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said that Russia has already begun to supply modern radars and air defense systems. This despite the historically close economic and cultural ties with Israel resulting from its large of Russian Jewish population. Analysts believe Moscow could not reject Tehran's appeals at is increasingly relying on Iranian along with North Korean military support for its war against Ukraine.\n\nColin Clark, director of research at intelligence and security consulting firm Soufan Group said that in asking Russia for air defenses they are cashing in their chips but, he says, \"The question is how the Russians can reassure Tehran without damaging relations with Israel.\"\n\nIran is preparing to strike Israel to avenge the murder of Haniyeh who had been invited to Tehran to attend President Pezeshkian's inauguration. He was killed on July 31 when, according to the IRGC \"a short-range projectile with a warhead weighing about 7 kilograms [15 pounds]\" was fired into the a guest house in which he was staying.\n\nIran immediately accused Israel for carrying out the attack which Jerusalem has neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nThe international community are concerned that an Iranian attack on Israel will be met by a major response that could provoke a full-scale war in the Middle East. US officials said they expected Tehran's strike is likely to be supported by Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen. Israel is currently preparing for what it feels could be an extensive multi-day onslaught including the organization of air defense shelters including an underground bunker in Jerusalem, where the top political leadership will take refuge in the event of war.\n\nIn response to the situation, Washington has increased its military presence in the region by deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, a squadron of F-22 Raptor fighter jets, and additional warships to the Middle East as well as stepping up diplomatic efforts along with its G7 partners to apply diplomatic pressure on both sides to avoid escalation.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh's killing on his Tehran visit.\n\nThe two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia's security council in May.\n\nThey said Shoigu's visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh's killing as \"a very dangerous assassination\", in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.\n\nThe Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran's Foreign ministry. On Monday it said Tehran did not seek to raise regional tensions but needed to punish Israel to prevent further instability.\n\nDIPLOMACY NO LONGER AN OPTION\n\nIn Washington, an official from the Biden administration warned on Monday of the risks of a major regional conflict. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, emphasized that the scale of Iran's and Hezbollah's response would be a key factor in determining the extent of a potential conflict.\n\nDespite efforts by Western and regional states to persuade Iran to retaliate in a measured way, or not at all, Tehran has told foreign officials it will respond \"severely\" to the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran, where he attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration, four Iranian sources independently confirmed.\n\nIn Lebanon, a prominent Lebanese source close to Hezbollah said \"a retaliatory strike is inevitable and diplomacy is no longer a viable option\", adding Iran wants the strike to be \"severe\" but not lead to a regional war. However, he said, this does not rule out the possibility of a war in Lebanon between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nA Middle East-focused senior U.S. official said Washington was doing all it can \"to dissuade all parties from going to a place they can't get back from,\" stressing that other states in the region and Europe should do more. A Qatari official said Doha was in constant discussion with Iran to lessen tensions.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that Israel must be prepared for anything, including a swift transition to offense.\n\nThe country's response to any attack by Hezbollah or Iran would likely depend more on the damage caused rather than the scale of the attack, according to two sources familiar with recent Israeli assessments.\n\nIsraeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also Hezbollah, with whom Israel has been trading fire since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and ignited the Gaza conflict.", "source":

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh's killing on his Tehran visit.\n\nThe two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia's security council in May.\n\nThey said Shoigu's visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh's killing as \"a very dangerous assassination\", in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.\n\nThe Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran's Foreign ministry. On Monday it said Tehran did not seek to raise regional tensions but needed to punish Israel to prevent further instability.\n\nDIPLOMACY NO LONGER AN OPTION\n\nIn Washington, an official from the Biden administration warned on Monday of the risks of a major regional conflict. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, emphasized that the scale of Iran's and Hezbollah's response would be a key factor in determining the extent of a potential conflict.\n\nDespite efforts by Western and regional states to persuade Iran to retaliate in a measured way, or not at all, Tehran has told foreign officials it will respond \"severely\" to the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran, where he attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration, four Iranian sources independently confirmed.\n\nIn Lebanon, a prominent Lebanese source close to Hezbollah said \"a retaliatory strike is inevitable and diplomacy is no longer a viable option\", adding Iran wants the strike to be \"severe\" but not lead to a regional war. However, he said, this does not rule out the possibility of a war in Lebanon between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nA Middle East-focused senior U.S. official said Washington was doing all it can \"to dissuade all parties from going to a place they can't get back from,\" stressing that other states in the region and Europe should do more. A Qatari official said Doha was in constant discussion with Iran to lessen tensions.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that Israel must be prepared for anything, including a swift transition to offense.\n\nThe country's response to any attack by Hezbollah or Iran would likely depend more on the damage caused rather than the scale of the attack, according to two sources familiar with recent Israeli assessments.\n\nIsraeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also Hezbollah, with whom Israel has been trading fire since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and ignited the Gaza conflict.\n\n(Reporting by

The officials, including a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information.\n\nThe delivery of these air defence systems, which includes modern radar equipment, has reportedly already commenced. The New York Times highlighted that on 5 August, former Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu visited Tehran, where he held discussions with Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Brigadier General Mohammad Bagheri, who oversees military strike planning against Israel. The talks also included Iran's Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council.\n\nThis visit highlights the close alliance between Iran and Russia, a partnership that has strengthened significantly since the onset of the Ukraine war in 2022. Iran has supplied Russia with military drones, and the two countries recently concluded an agreement to expand their military and intelligence cooperation.\n\nIranian state television broadcasted footage of Shoigu's meetings with General Bagheri and other high-ranking officials. The visual coverage displayed the warm greetings between the officials, followed by a round-table discussion that included members of both the Russian delegation and Iranian military leaders. Shoigu expressed Russia's readiness for comprehensive regional cooperation with Iran, as reported by Iranian state media.\n\nGeneral Bagheri emphasised the \"deep, long-term, and strategic\" nature of Iran-Russia relations, suggesting that these ties are set to deepen under Iran's new government.\n\nWhile Russia maintains significant economic and cultural ties with Israel, partly due to the sizeable population of Russian Jews in the country, analysts point out that Moscow is unlikely to refuse Tehran's requests for assistance. This is particularly true given Russia's reliance on Iranian drones in the war in Ukraine. Colin P. Clarke, a representative from the intelligence and security consultancy Soufan Group, noted that Iran is leveraging its position to obtain Russian air defence capabilities. The challenge for Russia, Clarke added, is to accommodate Iran's demands without jeopardising its relations with Israel.\n\nThe situation escalated following the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in a bomb explosion at his guest house in Iran, coinciding with the inauguration day of Iran's new president. In response, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has reportedly ordered a direct attack on Israel, escalating the already tense situation in the region.\n\nIsrael Prepares for Iranian

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh's killing on his Tehran visit.\n\nThe two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia's security council in May.\n\nThey said Shoigu's visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh's killing as \"a very dangerous assassination\", in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.\n\nThe Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran's Foreign ministry. On Monday it said Tehran did not seek to raise regional tensions but needed to punish Israel to prevent further instability.\n\nDIPLOMACY NO LONGER AN OPTION\n\nIn Washington, an official from the Biden administration warned on Monday of the risks of a major regional conflict. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, emphasized that the scale of Iran's and Hezbollah's response would be a key factor in determining the extent of a potential conflict.\n\nDespite efforts by Western and regional states to persuade Iran to retaliate in a measured way, or not at all, Tehran has told foreign officials it will respond \"severely\" to the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran, where he attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration, four Iranian sources independently confirmed.\n\nIn Lebanon, a prominent Lebanese source close to Hezbollah said \"a retaliatory strike is inevitable and diplomacy is no longer a viable option\", adding Iran wants the strike to be \"severe\" but not lead to a regional war. However, he said, this does not rule out the possibility of a war in Lebanon between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nA Middle East-focused senior U.S. official said Washington was doing all it can \"to dissuade all parties from going to a place they can\u00b4t get back from,\" stressing that other states in the region and Europe should do more. A Qatari official said Doha was in constant discussion with Iran to lessen tensions.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that Israel must be prepared for anything, including a swift transition to offense.\n\nThe country's response to any attack by Hezbollah or Iran would likely depend more on the damage caused rather than the scale of the attack, according to two sources familiar with recent Israeli assessments.\n\nIsraeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also Hezbollah, with whom Israel has been trading fire since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and ignited the Gaza conflict.\n\n(Reporting by

Shoigu is now secretary of Russia's Security Council but recent arrests of high-ranking officials who served with him have raised speculation about his declining influence within the Kremlin.\n\nShoigu met with top Iranian officials on Monday, including new president Masoud Pezeshkian, Armed Forces General Staff Chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri, and Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Akbar Ahmadian.\n\nTehran said it would expand ties with Moscow in talks which come as Iran weighs its response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, a political leader from the Iranian-backed Hamas group which has accused Israel of being behind the killing.\n\nHowever, back in Russia there were further arrests of Shoigu's former top colleagues making the news.\n\nVyacheslav Akhmedov and Major General Vladimir Shesterov were detained on Monday suspected of fraud related to the embezzlement of government funds for Patriot Park, considered to be Russia's \"military Disneyland,\" said to be Shoigu's personal project.\n\nIn April, Russia's deputy defense minister Timur Ivanov had been arrested on accusations of treason and accused of bribe-taking. Meanwhile, last week, Russian state media reported that Vladimir Pavlov, the head of the defense ministry's procurement arm, JSC Voentorg, had been arrested and accused of fraud.\n\nThe Russian military blogger Two Majors said on Telegram the latest arrests were part of a clampdown on the previous team that controlled the defense ministry under Shoigu's leadership and showed his diminishing influence. \"The weeding out of corrupt officials continues, which is good news,\" Monday's post by Two Majors said.\n\nThe Telegram channel VCHK-OGPU, which claims to have links to Russia's security services, posted on August 1 that long-time Shoigu ally, Pavel Baryshev, was dismissed from his post as deputy minister of natural resources.\n\n\"Shoigu continues to lose his people in the power structures,\" the post said, \"Baryshev's dismissal is an indicator of the loss of influence of the Shoigu clan.\"\n\nIn noting the responses by Russian military bloggers, the Institute for the Study

State-run RIA news agency reported on Tuesday that Shoigu said he discussed Haniyeh's killing on his Tehran visit.\n\nThe two sources with knowledge of the matter did not provide further details on the talks with Shoigu, who was defence minister before becoming the secretary of Russia's security council in May.\n\nThey said Shoigu's visit was one of several avenues Moscow had used to relay to Iran the need for restraint while at the same time condemning Haniyeh's killing as \"a very dangerous assassination\", in a bid to prevent a Middle East war.\n\nThe Middle East, the sources said, was on the brink of a major war and those behind the assassination were clearly trying to trigger such a conflict.\n\nRussia has cultivated closer ties with Iran since the start of its war with Ukraine and has said it is preparing to sign a wide-ranging cooperation agreement with Tehran.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Iran's Foreign ministry. On Monday it said Tehran did not seek to raise regional tensions but needed to punish Israel to prevent further instability.\n\nDIPLOMACY NO LONGER AN OPTION\n\nIn Washington, an official from the Biden administration warned on Monday of the risks of a major regional conflict. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, emphasized that the scale of Iran's and Hezbollah's response would be a key factor in determining the extent of a potential conflict.\n\nDespite efforts by Western and regional states to persuade Iran to retaliate in a measured way, or not at all, Tehran has told foreign officials it will respond \"severely\" to the killing of Haniyeh in Tehran, where he attended President Masoud Pezeshkian's inauguration, four Iranian sources independently confirmed.\n\nIn Lebanon, a prominent Lebanese source close to Hezbollah said \"a retaliatory strike is inevitable and diplomacy is no longer a viable option\", adding Iran wants the strike to be \"severe\" but not lead to a regional war. However, he said, this does not rule out the possibility of a war in Lebanon between Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nA Middle East-focused senior U.S. official said Washington was doing all it can \"to dissuade all parties from going to a place they can't get back from,\" stressing that other states in the region and Europe should do more. A Qatari official said Doha was in constant discussion with Iran to lessen tensions.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned on Monday that Israel must be prepared for anything, including a swift transition to offense.\n\nThe country's response to any attack by Hezbollah or Iran would likely depend more on the damage caused rather than the scale of the attack, according to two sources familiar with recent Israeli assessments.\n\nIsraeli officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also Hezbollah, with whom Israel has been trading fire since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and ignited the Gaza conflict.\n\n(Reporting by

How is that for symmetry among enemies?\n\nSergei Shoigu, Russia's ex-Defense Minister and current national Security Council secretary, is meeting with senior Iranian military and security officials, as well as newly sworn-in president Masoud Pezeshkian.\n\nRussia's RIA Novosti news agency described the focus of the talks as \"strengthening bilateral cooperation in a wide range of spheres including security\" - and the meetings come amid growing speculation that Russia is actively helping the Islamic Republic to thwart potential Israeli attacks.\n\nRussia has \"strongly condemned\" the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last Wednesday. Iran considered the brazen act as tantamount to assassinating an official head of state while on an official visit. President Pezeshkian has meanwhile hailed Moscow as a \"valued strategic ally.\"\n\nThere has of late been much speculation that President Putin is ready to give greater support to America's rivals and enemies in the Middle East as 'payback' for Washington's support to Ukraine over the past more than two years.\n\nAlso on Monday, the Israeli military confirmed that head of US Central Command, General Michael Kurilla, is in the country to assess the security situation against the backdrop of the potential attack from Iran.\n\nKurilla met with Israeli army chief, Lieutenant-General Herzi Halevi, and \"held a joint situational assessment on security and strategic issues, as well as joint preparations in the region, as part of the response to threats in the Middle East,\" according to a statement carried in Israeli press.\n\nBoth Israel and Iran have been rallying global allies to their respective sides. Iran on Monday announced it has called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to discuss the assassination of Haniyeh and to gain support for a military response. That meeting is planned for Wednesday.\n\nThe Guardian has said Tehran officials will at the meeting attempt convince Arab nations to give political backing to its right of retribution. This strongly suggests in the meantime that a major attack likely won't come Monday or Tuesday, but the anticipation could stretch into later this week.\n\nThe same publication notes that Biden is \"due to meet his national security team in Washington at 2.15 pm local time, approximately 10pm in Tehran, by which time it is likely to be clear if Iran is planning to launch an attack overnight.\"", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

The whole range of issues, starting with Syria. Certainly, the disturbing developments on Lebanon's border with Israel were on the agenda. Of course, the recent tragic events that took place in Tehran were touched upon. It was impossible to bypass this topic,\" Shoigu told the media reporters.\n\nA sharp aggravation of the situation in the Middle East began in recent days following the assassination in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the chairman of the political bureau of the radical Palestinian movement Hamas, and the liquidation in Beirut of Fouad Shokr, one of the commanders of the military wing of the Shiite movement Hezbollah.\n\nIran, Hamas and Hezbollah held Israel responsible for the incident and said they would not leave it unretaliated.\n\nThe Jewish state's authorities did not comment on Haniyeh's death, and called Shokr's elimination a response to the shelling of the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, where 12 people were killed. Hezbollah disclaimed responsibility for the attack.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security Council of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Shoigu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Shoigu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Pezeshkian", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masoud Pezeshkian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Bagheri_(Iranian_commander)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Bagheri (Iranian commander)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Druze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Heights", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golan Heights"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majdal_Shams", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majdal Shams"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Majdal Shams"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791494", "eventUri": "eng-9791494", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 105}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

The transfer was reportedly carried out using IL-76 military transport aircraft, which made multiple flights from Russia to Iran.\n\nThis move comes amid heightened tensions following threats from Iran to strike Israel in retaliation for the elimination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nDefense Express noted that Iran had not previously been known to possess these types of weapons, and there had been no public discussion about their transfer. This suggests that Russian personnel might be accompanying the equipment to operate it, as Iranian specialists are unlikely to have been trained on these systems.\n\nMurmansk-BN systems are designed to suppress satellite navigation and communication over distances up to 5,000 km.\n\nThe transfer of the Iskander missile system is significant in light of Iran's missile needs. The Iskander systems have a range of up to 500 km, but Iran would require missiles with a range of about 1,200 km to reach Israel.\n\nThis raises the possibility that Iskander-K systems, with R-500 cruise missiles capable of reaching 1,500 km, might have been included in the transfer.\n\nAmid these developments, a large-scale Iranian attack on Israel is anticipated. Speculations suggested the attack could have occured between the night of August 5th and 6th, potentially mirroring a previous attack on April 14, when Iran launched numerous drones and missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted.\n\nOn Monday, August 6, Russia's former Defense Minister now the secretary of the Kremlin's Security Council, Sergei Shoigu, has reportedly landed in Tehran to meet top Iranian officials.\n\nAs reported by Russian news agency Interfax, Shoigu was set to hold talks with President Masoud Pezeshkian, Ali Akbar Ahmadian, Iran's secretary of the Supreme National

This message was delivered by Russia's Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, who met with Iranian leaders including President Masoud Pezeshkian, on Monday in Tehran.\n\nNow, why would the Russian \"murderous dictator,\" as President Biden once called Putin, do this at the time when the Pentagon is boosting its military presence in the Middle East in preparation for what Secretary of State Antony Blinken termed as an \"imminent\" attack on Israel by Iran and Hezbollah?\n\nThe worst-case scenario that many national security professionals are now worried about is a broader war in the Middle East. And if that happens, the big question is: Would Russia, the world's largest nuclear power and a top U.S. antagonist, align itself with Iran? Because if it did, it would have catastrophic consequences for the region and the world.\n\nWHY PUTIN PREFERS HARRIS OVER TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE\n\nThere's an assumption now in Washington that Putin would automatically side with Tehran and against Israel and the United States. After all, Iran has been providing Moscow with hundreds of ballistic missiles, drones and other munitions to fight against Ukraine. The U.S., on the other hand, has been flowing advanced weapons and cash to Ukraine to help degrade the Russian military.\n\nBut Putin's decision calculus is not simple. His relationship with Israel and Tehran is not linear, but rather it's driven by complex considerations. Here's why Putin almost certainly doesn't want a devastating strike on Israel.\n\nThroughout his presidency and until the invasion of Ukraine, Putin has pursued a largely pro-Israel policy. Not because he is a nice guy, but because he is a pragmatist. Since becoming president in 2000, Putin has drastically improved the Russian-Israeli relationship. After decades of hostile relations between the USSR and Israel, Putin became the first Kremlin leader to visit Israel in 2005. He subsequently endorsed the building of a massive $60 million Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center, to which he donated a month's worth of his salary. Having opened in Moscow in 2012, the museum acknowledged Russia's and the USSR's history of antisemitism and recognized the contributions of Jews to Soviet life.\n\nAs a practical matter, Putin likely calculates that the 1.2 million Russian and former Soviet e\u0301migre\u0301s living in Israel represent a good pool of expatriates who could return to their own or their parents' motherland, adding some educated human capital to demographically struggling Russia. He also sees Jewish e\u0301migre\u0301s in Israel, Europe and the United States as a potential source of investment in Russia, especially in high technology, now that Russia is marginalized from the West because of its war on Ukraine.\n\nPutin frequently meets with the Chief Rabbi of Russia Berel Lazar. They write joint holiday greetings to the Jewish people in Russia. Putin sometimes repeats the jokes that Lazar tells him. When speaking about the Russian-speaking Israeli population, Putin calls them \"our Jews\" (\"Nashi Yevrei\").\n\nRUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA RATCHETING UP THREATS AGAINST US. WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW\n\nMoreover, Putin probably sees an opportunity to influence the politics of the Jewish state as Israel has become home to the world's largest population of Jews from the former Soviet Union, with 15%-17% of the Israeli population being Russian-speaking.\n\nPutin used to have an excellent relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who views the Russian e\u0301migre\u0301 population as key to his political success and survival. Indeed, Jewish immigrants and their descendants have become a sizable secular nationalist political block, which has secured right-wing rule to this day. During his 2019 electoral campaign, Netanyahu placed ads and billboards in Russian, highlighting his ties with Putin, and increased the number of Russian-language media interviews in hopes of getting Russian-Israelis' votes.\n\nThe personal rapport between Putin and Netanyahu, both realpolitik-minded and pragmatic, strengthened the Russian-Israeli relationship. The two leaders share the belief that Islamic extremism is a common enemy with which there cannot be a compromise. Notably, Israel did not criticize Moscow for its wars in Muslim Chechnya nor did it express any negative reaction to Putin's annexation of Crimea.\n\nIn fact, Israel studiously maintained a neutral posture during the initial stages of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, having refrained from condemning Putin for the invasion, refused to join the U.S. and EU sanctions against Moscow, and opted to provide only humanitarian aid to Ukraine rather than military hardware. This was a strategic decision by Israel, which viewed Russia as a new power broker in the region critical to its ability to manage the threat from Iran. Risking Washington's ire, Israel prioritized the critically needed security coordination between the Russian military and Israel Defense Forces in Syria, where Russia controls the skies and has tacitly allowed Israeli fighter jets to conduct strikes on Iranian proxies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMoscow was not always a friend of the ayatollahs either, having shared a tumultuous history with Tehran. In 2010, the Kremlin - obeying U.N. sanctions - banned by a presidential decree the sale to Iran of S-300 air defense missile system, which would have augmented the defenses of Iranian nuclear sites from airstrikes. And in 2019, amid rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, Putin declined Iran's request to buy the advanced S-400 missile defense system. This was probably in response to concerns shared by Israel and Saudi Arabia and because he sought to maintain a positive working relationship with the two.\n\nThe Biden administration, however, has driven a wedge between Moscow and Jerusalem, pushing Russia and Iran closer than ever. Under relentless pressure, Washington compelled Israel to supply military hardware to Ukraine to fight against Russia.\n\nPutin is highly unlikely to risk losing all of this political and personal capital he built with Russian-Israeli Jews and the state of Israel over the course of almost a quarter of a century, and alienating Saudi Arabia, by letting himself be perceived as enabling Iran to strike Israel.\n\nPublicly, Moscow will almost certainly maintain pro-Iran and anti-Western rhetoric, however, aiming to keep Iran on its side and to boost its negotiating leverage with the United States over Ukraine and Western economic sanctions. Putin seeks to show the U.S. and the world that he can be dealt with on a transactional basis.\n\nThe recent massive prisoner exchange with the U.S. and several European countries is a clear example of that. The prisoner swap took place even as Ukraine was finally receiving U.S. F-16s, which will be killing Russian forces. On Friday, Putin also withdrew at the last minute the delivery of weaponry to Houthi rebels in Yemen, also probably to show to Saudi Arabia and the U.S. that Moscow, while in a marriage of convenience with Tehran, is not seeking a World War III.\n\nThe rhetoric coming out of the Biden administration about Putin and Russia - like \"son of a b---h,\" \"murderous dictator\" and \"gas station masquerading as a country\" - reveals that emotions rather than rational calculus are driving Washington's policies. This incompetent and childish approach to statecraft has set the world on fire.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs November is getting ever closer, Americans must decide which team - Trump or Harris - has the intellectual firepower, competence and nuanced understanding of the world to ensure America's and its true allies' security first.\n\nPutin may be a killer and a dictator, but he is realpolitik to the core, skillfully playing a geopolitical game of chess. His decision calculus is not irrational. To outplay him, any U.S. leader must understand the Russian spymaster's thinking first.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

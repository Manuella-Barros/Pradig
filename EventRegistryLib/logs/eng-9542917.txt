Write us off at your own parallel,\" he said.\n\nLesufi added that the campaign of the ANC was in phases, saying former party and state deputy president David Mabuza would also bolster the provincial push in addition to Sexwale.\n\n\"So you will see all these faces because you have to keep the campaign interesting all the time,\" he said.\n\n\"If we didn't put Thabo Mbeki, will you still be interested in the ANC campaign, so it has its phases to ensure that it is relevant, to ensure it has interest and it has following.\"\n\nLesufi, who is also Gauteng premier, was alluding to the Mbeki campaigning for the ANC in Soweto, Gauteng and the country's biggest township. It was Mbeki's first time electoral work for the party since 2007, owing to his sour relationship with former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nSouth Africa's second democratically-elected president told journalists in Soweto that people would see a lot of him on the campaign trail, but this did not mean he had put aside the concerns he raised about the ANC before.\n\n\"I came to Jabulani to ask the people of Soweto to vote for the ANC on 29 May. I have not been in Soweto for a long time but I think the response is very good. We will come here again because I think it is important that we should return the ANC to power,\" he said.\n\n\"I know there are many problems within the country, even problems within the ANC. As we say vote ANC, we are saying we will attend to the problems within the ANC itself to make sure it is able to discharge the responsibilities of the population.\"\n\nThe governing party narrowly won the province by 50.19% in 2019 which was a dip from the 2014 results which saw them amass 53.59% share of the votes.\n\nWithout providing any proof for his assertions, Gauteng ANC spokesperson Lesego Makhubela claimed its internal polls predicted that the party would win the province by between 55% and 62% of the votes.\n\nSpeaking to the M&G this week, Makhubela accused the Democratic Alliance and ActionSA of \"cooking\" the polls revealing that the ANC would lose its majority in the province.\n\nIn an interview with M&G last month, DA leader John Steenhuisen admitted that John van Der Berg, who is the managing partner of Victory Research, one of the polling companies that have predicted that the ANC will not win the election outright, was working for the DA and was doing the party's polling.\n\nMakhubela said: \"We are happy that the DA and ActionSA are exposing each other about how they are working and colluding...to cook the surveys and the polls in order to run propaganda and prepare the electorate for something that will never happen -- - that the ANC will lose power.\"\n\nOpposition parties have also accused the ANC of using government resources for electioneering by using the Nasi Ispani initiative -- - Lesufi's jobs creation drive where thousands of young people have been absorbed into the provincial government -- to lure voters for the upcoming election.\n\nBut Makhubela said the jobs drive was part of listening to voters' concerns about unemployment, including more than a month without the country experiencing rolling Eskom blackouts that have become a feature pf daily life for over a decade.\n\n\"They told us even before elections that we need to fix Eskom and that is why we sent the most capable [people] to go and deal with the Eskom issue and that is why when we speak now, load shedding is a thing of the past,\" he said.\n\nWith new players like ActionSA, Umkhonto weSizwe Party and Patriotic Alliance expected to have their own say in Gauteng, the ANC seems to be leaving nothing to chance by calling on its big guns to campaign for the party.\n\nOn Sexwale's recruitment, Makhubela called the former provincial premier a \"towering giant of the revolution\", adding that Sexwale was known across Gauteng.\n\nSpeaking to M&G on Thursday Makhubela said Sexwale was the first premier of Gauteng, a towering giant of their revolution and one of the most respected citizens of the province.\n\n\"It means the towering stalwarts of the ANC have come to endorse the renewal of the ANC and have come to show confidence in the campaign of the ANC,\" Makhubela said.\n\nHe added that Sexwale would be deployed to the squatter camps, affluent suburbs, the farm part of the province, among other campaign stops.\n\n\"There is no specific target. He will be speaking to every person who is eligible to vote and those who are not eligible to vote.\"", "source": {"uri": "mg.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mail & Guardian"}, "authors":

The party has been electorally dominant since then, reaching a peak of 69.7% of national votes in 2004.\n\nHowever, support for the party has declined sharply since the 2014 national and provincial elections, reaching a low of 57.5% in 2019.\n\nNegative attitudes towards the ruling party have depressed its vote tallies, increased abstention, and widened potential support for opposition parties. Opinion polls have consistently shown that the ANC will not win the more than 50% of votes required to form a government by itself in the national and provincial elections on 29 May 2024.\n\nThis raises the likelihood of the first national coalition government in 30 years.\n\nFor my PhD thesis I researched how South African opposition parties organise and campaign at the municipal level, and the factors that influence individual voting decisions. It revealed that voting decisions are heavily conditioned by experiences with government service delivery. More than policy platforms, the decision to vote was influenced by personal feelings about whether any political party could be trusted to provide basic health, electricity, housing, and roads in a fair manner.\n\nAs part of doctoral research to understand the nuances of South African voting behaviour, I conducted semi-structured interviews with 111 people who intended to vote for the ANC in the municipalities of eThekwini, on the east coast of the country; Johannesburg; Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg; and Rustenburg, in the North West province; between 2017 and 2018. I focused on black townships, which have historically been bastions of support for the ruling party.\n\nBased on the research findings, I argue that the extent of loyalty to the ANC varied significantly among supporters. Many of those intending to vote ANC in 2019 expressed only a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. Their weaker ties to the ANC make them more prone to changing their votes or abstaining in subsequent elections. This was most evident among those who reached voting age after the first democratic elections in 1994. This demographic made up 68% of the voting age population at the time of the 2022 StatsSA Census.\n\nA first category of ANC voters expressed strong loyalty to the party, which was more prevalent among older South Africans but also some younger voters who valued the ANC's history in the struggle for political freedom. Strong emotional attachments to the party made them resistant to changing their voting choice. Individuals affirmed that \"now I won't just turn my back\" or\n\nyou will be an ANC member until you die.\n\nHowever, a second category of ANC supporter had a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. They voted for it because they saw it as the only party that had provided services to their communities. They had more of a transactional relationship than an emotional investment. They said they would continue to vote for the ANC because it was the only party that had historically shown a commitment to \"change\" and \"development\" within their communities, even though they were not satisfied with the current rate of improvements in housing, electricity, and water service delivery.\n\nA 39-year-old woman in Soweto explained that even though she was deeply unsatisfied with the ANC, she would continue to vote for them\n\nbecause they used to do good things.\n\nA third category of ANC voters voted strategically or habitually because they thought it was prudent to align themselves with the party most likely to win. Despite their unhappiness with ANC performance, they were afraid that voting for an opposition party would be a \"waste\" because they were unlikely to win. They expressed a declining emotional attachment to the ANC over time. A 31-year-old man explained this in an interview:\n\nI am so confused now, because yes, I have voted before, but now things are not the same like before.\n\nOpposition parties were not seen as viable because they had not contributed to local development. While local governments are directly responsible for providing electricity, sanitation and water services, the provincial and national governments have a significant role in providing basic healthcare, electricity generation, housing and upgrading informal settlements.\n\nVoters were concerned that they were less likely to benefit from these services if they elected an opposition councillor or provincial government that would have to work with the ANC government at the national level. In this way, strategic considerations often loomed larger than policy platforms or party leadership.\n\nTipping point\n\nSince the 2019 elections, public opinion of the ANC has continued to worsen. Perceptions of service delivery have been undermined by, for example, power cuts that have devastated the economy.\n\nThe thinning loyalty towards the ANC (especially among young people) increases the probability that they will change their voting behaviour in the future. Some may opt to abstain. But if eligible voters start to see opposition parties as credible challengers, then voting for them will represent a potentially effective way to improve development outcomes.\n\nAs the most loyal ANC voters from older generations continue to decline relative to the \"born free\" generations, the narrative of the ANC's decline could potentially drive strategic voters to opposition parties in greater numbers.\n\nThe 2024 elections may well be the tipping point that enables opposition parties to portray themselves as viable contenders in the formation of coalition governments on the provincial and national stage. These parties are poised to attract votes from those with a \"thin\" loyalty to the ANC. As feelings of loyalty diminish, the electoral environment is becoming more conducive for voters to entertain the real possibility of putting opposition parties in positions of power.\n\nMichael Braun

The party has been electorally dominant since then, reaching a peak of 69.7% of national votes in 2004.\n\nHowever, support for the party has declined sharply since the 2014 national and provincial elections, reaching a low of 57.5% in 2019.\n\nNegative attitudes towards the ruling party have depressed its vote tallies, increased abstention, and widened potential support for opposition parties. Opinion polls have consistently shown that the ANC will not win the more than 50% of votes required to form a government by itself in the national and provincial elections on 29 May 2024.\n\nThis raises the likelihood of the first national coalition government in 30 years.\n\nFor my PhD thesis I researched how South African opposition parties organise and campaign at the municipal level, and the factors that influence individual voting decisions. It revealed that voting decisions are heavily conditioned by experiences with government service delivery. More than policy platforms, the decision to vote was influenced by personal feelings about whether any political party could be trusted to provide basic health, electricity, housing, and roads in a fair manner.\n\nRead more: After the euphoria of Nelson Mandela's election, what happened next? Podcast\n\nAs part of doctoral research to understand the nuances of South African voting behaviour, I conducted semi-structured interviews with 111 people who intended to vote for the ANC in the municipalities of eThekwini, on the east coast of the country; Johannesburg; Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg; and Rustenburg, in the North West province; between 2017 and 2018. I focused on black townships, which have historically been bastions of support for the ruling party.\n\nBased on the research findings, I argue that the extent of loyalty to the ANC varied significantly among supporters. Many of those intending to vote ANC in 2019 expressed only a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. Their weaker ties to the ANC make them more prone to changing their votes or abstaining in subsequent elections. This was most evident among those who reached voting age after the first democratic elections in 1994. This demographic made up 68% of the voting age population at the time of the 2022 StatsSA Census.\n\nA first category of ANC voters expressed strong loyalty to the party, which was more prevalent among older South Africans but also some younger voters who valued the ANC's history in the struggle for political freedom. Strong emotional attachments to the party made them resistant to changing their voting choice. Individuals affirmed that \"now I won't just turn my back\" or\n\nHowever, a second category of ANC supporter had a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. They voted for it because they saw it as the only party that had provided services to their communities. They had more of a transactional relationship than an emotional investment. They said they would continue to vote for the ANC because it was the only party that had historically shown a commitment to \"change\" and \"development\" within their communities, even though they were not satisfied with the current rate of improvements in housing, electricity, and water service delivery.\n\nA 39-year-old woman in Soweto explained that even though she was deeply unsatisfied with the ANC, she would continue to vote for them\n\nA third category of ANC voters voted strategically or habitually because they thought it was prudent to align themselves with the party most likely to win. Despite their unhappiness with ANC performance, they were afraid that voting for an opposition party would be a \"waste\" because they were unlikely to win. They expressed a declining emotional attachment to the ANC over time. A 31-year-old man explained this in an interview:\n\nI am so confused now, because yes, I have voted before, but now things are not the same like before.\n\nOpposition parties were not seen as viable because they had not contributed to local development. While local governments are directly responsible for providing electricity, sanitation and water services, the provincial and national governments have a significant role in providing basic healthcare, electricity generation, housing and upgrading informal settlements.\n\nRead more: South Africa's ANC marks its 112th year with an eye on national elections, but its record is patchy and future uncertain\n\nVoters were concerned that they were less likely to benefit from these services if they elected an opposition councillor or provincial government that would have to work with the ANC government at the national level. In this way, strategic considerations often loomed larger than policy platforms or party leadership.\n\nSince the 2019 elections, public opinion of the ANC has continued to worsen. Perceptions of service delivery have been undermined by, for example, power cuts that have devastated the economy.\n\nThe thinning loyalty towards the ANC (especially among young people) increases the probability that they will change their voting behaviour in the future. Some may opt to abstain. But if eligible voters start to see opposition parties as credible challengers, then voting for them will represent a potentially effective way to improve development outcomes.\n\nRead more: South Africa's ruling party has favoured loyalty over competence - now cadre deployment has come back to bite it\n\nAs the most loyal ANC voters from older generations continue to decline relative to the \"born free\" generations, the narrative of the ANC's decline could potentially drive strategic voters to opposition parties in greater numbers.\n\nThe 2024 elections may well be the tipping point that enables opposition parties to portray themselves as viable contenders in the formation of coalition governments on the provincial and national stage. These parties are poised to attract votes from those with a \"thin\" loyalty to the ANC. As feelings of loyalty diminish, the electoral environment is becoming more conducive for voters to entertain the real possibility of putting opposition parties in positions of power.\n\nMichael Braun

The party has been electorally dominant since then, reaching a peak of 69.7% of national votes in 2004.\n\nHowever, support for the party has declined sharply since the 2014 national and provincial elections, reaching a low of 57.5% in 2019.\n\nNegative attitudes towards the ruling party have depressed its vote tallies, increased abstention, and widened potential support for opposition parties. Opinion polls have consistently shown that the ANC will not win the more than 50% of votes required to form a government by itself in the national and provincial elections on 29 May 2024.\n\nThis raises the likelihood of the first national coalition government in 30 years.\n\nFor my PhD thesis I researched how South African opposition parties organise and campaign at the municipal level, and the factors that influence individual voting decisions. It revealed that voting decisions are heavily conditioned by experiences with government service delivery. More than policy platforms, the decision to vote was influenced by personal feelings about whether any political party could be trusted to provide basic health, electricity, housing, and roads in a fair manner.\n\nRead more: After the euphoria of Nelson Mandela's election, what happened next? Podcast\n\nAs part of doctoral research to understand the nuances of South African voting behaviour, I conducted semi-structured interviews with 111 people who intended to vote for the ANC in the municipalities of eThekwini, on the east coast of the country; Johannesburg; Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg; and Rustenburg, in the North West province; between 2017 and 2018. I focused on black townships, which have historically been bastions of support for the ruling party.\n\nBased on the research findings, I argue that the extent of loyalty to the ANC varied significantly among supporters. Many of those intending to vote ANC in 2019 expressed only a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. Their weaker ties to the ANC make them more prone to changing their votes or abstaining in subsequent elections. This was most evident among those who reached voting age after the first democratic elections in 1994. This demographic made up 68% of the voting age population at the time of the 2022 StatsSA Census.\n\nDegrees of loyalty\n\nA first category of ANC voters expressed strong loyalty to the party, which was more prevalent among older South Africans but also some younger voters who valued the ANC's history in the struggle for political freedom. Strong emotional attachments to the party made them resistant to changing their voting choice. Individuals affirmed that \"now I won't just turn my back\" or\n\nyou will be an ANC member until you die.\n\nHowever, a second category of ANC supporter had a \"thin\" loyalty to the party. They voted for it because they saw it as the only party that had provided services to their communities. They had more of a transactional relationship than an emotional investment. They said they would continue to vote for the ANC because it was the only party that had historically shown a commitment to \"change\" and \"development\" within their communities, even though they were not satisfied with the current rate of improvements in housing, electricity, and water service delivery.\n\nA 39-year-old woman in Soweto explained that even though she was deeply unsatisfied with the ANC, she would continue to vote for them\n\nbecause they used to do good things.\n\nA third category of ANC voters voted strategically or habitually because they thought it was prudent to align themselves with the party most likely to win. Despite their unhappiness with ANC performance, they were afraid that voting for an opposition party would be a \"waste\" because they were unlikely to win. They expressed a declining emotional attachment to the ANC over time. A 31-year-old man explained this in an interview:\n\nI am so confused now, because yes, I have voted before, but now things are not the same like before.\n\nOpposition parties were not seen as viable because they had not contributed to local development. While local governments are directly responsible for providing electricity, sanitation and water services, the provincial and national governments have a significant role in providing basic healthcare, electricity generation, housing and upgrading informal settlements.\n\nRead more: South Africa's ANC marks its 112th year with an eye on national elections, but its record is patchy and future uncertain\n\nVoters were concerned that they were less likely to benefit from these services if they elected an opposition councillor or provincial government that would have to work with the ANC government at the national level. In this way, strategic considerations often loomed larger than policy platforms or party leadership.\n\nTipping point\n\nSince the 2019 elections, public opinion of the ANC has continued to worsen. Perceptions of service delivery have been undermined by, for example, power cuts that have devastated the economy.\n\nThe thinning loyalty towards the ANC (especially among young people) increases the probability that they will change their voting behaviour in the future. Some may opt to abstain. But if eligible voters start to see opposition parties as credible challengers, then voting for them will represent a potentially effective way to improve development outcomes.\n\nRead more: South Africa's ruling party has favoured loyalty over competence - now cadre deployment has come back to bite it\n\nAs the most loyal ANC voters from older generations continue to decline relative to the \"born free\" generations, the narrative of the ANC's decline could potentially drive strategic voters to opposition parties in greater numbers.\n\nThe 2024 elections may well be the tipping point that enables opposition parties to portray themselves as viable contenders in the formation of coalition governments on the provincial and national stage. These parties are poised to attract votes from those with a \"thin\" loyalty to the ANC. As feelings of loyalty diminish, the electoral environment is becoming more conducive for voters to entertain the real possibility of putting opposition parties in positions of power.", "source":

Shut the door and keep Malema out of power", "body": "What a difference a few days can make. Just two weeks ago, many people were predicting that the ANC could fall to below 40% in the general elections and that it would have to choose between a coalition with the DA, or with the EFF. The news was dominated by former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto Wesizwe party.\n\nNow the trend may be turning.\n\nAs the ANC has started its campaign in earnest, and former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kgalema Motlanthe have entered the fray, the polling indicates the ANC's share of the vote is rising (Gareth van Onselen, no friend of the ANC, says that on current trends, the ANC could go above 50%).\n\nAt the same time, the more established opposition parties appear to be losing ground, while the newer parties may be losing their shine (the smaller the party, the harder it can be to poll for).\n\nSoon, the strategists in every party will start to think about the longer term, a crucial task for the political players who are not focused exclusively on these elections.\n\nFor them, deciding who to team up with in a coalition must be compatible with a coherent longer-term strategy for 2029 and beyond.\n\nPolling from Ipsos shows that while the ANC is just above 41%, the EFF is now at 11.5%.\n\nIf this were the final result, it would mean that while the ANC had lost significant support, the EFF had increased its share by less than one percentage point -- revealing an inability to exploit exploding unhappiness with the government over its many failures, which include soaring youth unemployment.\n\nThe EFF has been the biggest electoral threat the ANC has ever faced. The governing party hasn't ever had to worry about the DA winning more votes nationally, while the EFF has shown that it is prepared to campaign over the longer term, and Cope has collapsed. And MK is surely a one-election party (Zuma will be 87 in 2029).\n\nThe EFF has also caused damage to the ANC by targeting its leaders, first Jacob Zuma and now President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Elections 2024\n\nAt the same time, the major source of the EFF's influence is its role of kingmaker in councils.\n\nIf the ANC were determined to focus solely on the longer term, the best way to remove the EFF as a threat forever would be to simply keep it away from the machinery of power, regardless of the short-term cost.\n\nShould the ruling party refuse to work with the EFF in any legislature, reject a coalition with it in the national government and cease working relationships with it in provinces and councils, Julius Malema would be reduced to the leader of an opposition party that had lost momentum.\n\nUnder that pressure, it would be difficult for him to keep the party going for another five years.\n\nThere is evidence that Malema understands this. In recent days, he has suggested that despite their obvious differences, he would be prepared to work with the DA.\n\nAnother benefit for the ANC of shutting out the EFF is that the DA would come under pressure.\n\nConsidering that DA leader John Steenhuisen has said several times over the years that he would be willing to work with the ANC, it should not be that hard for the ANC to convince him to follow through.\n\nAnd, in the hard-nosed world of coalition negotiations, they would probably say he could tell his constituency he was only doing this to save them from the ANC's only other option, what the DA calls the \"doomsday coalition\".\n\nBut, in the longer term, working with the ANC would probably see the DA losing support ahead of 2029. (Something similar has happened before. In 2009, the FF+ deployed its leader, Pieter Mulder, to the position of deputy minister of agriculture, and the result was that his party lost support).\n\nOf course, the ANC's senior strategists could decide to go in the opposite direction.\n\nThey could conclude the DA will never be a long-term threat and that the way to neutralise the EFF is to force Malema to join a coalition with the ANC.\n\nHowever, the EFF -- like the DA -- could be accused of \"selling out\" by working with the ANC. This would surely frustrate many of its voters who responded to its campaign for radical change.\n\nOf course, it is not only the ANC making decisions -- the EFF, the DA and other parties also have to think strategically about the longer term.\n\nThe DA appears to have been spending more time planning for the longer term than the other parties and could enter any post-election discussion with a clearer strategy.\n\nBut for Malema, if the results of this election do show he has lost momentum, he may have to grasp any possible coalition opportunity given to him -- he would be forced to think only of the short term.\n\nHowever, there is still some time before the elections. And the polling on which political parties are currently basing their strategies could be very wrong -- which means they need to be flexible, right up until the final results are announced.\n\nWith more than three weeks to go, almost anything could happen.

It's a powerful position, which sets the tone, direction, work and scruples of Parliament. The Constitution stipulates that Parliament must oversee and hold to account all organs of state. That's aside from lawmaking.\n\nWhen asked to name the Speakers of the highest standing, most people would list the late Frene Ginwala and Max Sisulu. Both were nonpartisan in presiding in the House and running Parliament. Both understood the national legislature was a multiparty institution that required cooperation -- regardless of political views and majoritarian tendencies -- to work effectively in the interest of the people, not the political elite.\n\nSince 1994, the ANC has retained the Speaker's post, effectively the head of the legislative sphere of state, like the Chief Justice heads the judiciary and the President the executive. With remuneration pegged at the same level as that of the Deputy President, it is an attractive offering. As one of the two presiding officers established in the Constitution, the National Assembly Speaker has the edge, as the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson is dependent on provincial dynamics and pace.\n\nOnly ex-deputy president Baleka Mbete doubled up state and party -- she was ANC national chairperson and National Assembly Speaker from 2014 to 2017, before leaving Parliament after the 2019 elections. The ANC's Speakers are part of its Political Committee, which is key to translating party policy to governance, and its National Executive Committee, the party's highest decision-making structure between conferences.\n\nIf the 29 May elections produce a result that requires the ANC to form a coalition, the post of National Assembly Speaker could be crucial. Were the ANC to let go of this post, it would signal a desperation to retain power.\n\nMore comfortable for the ANC would be negotiations for the posts of House chairperson -- these included opposition MPs until the Jacob Zuma administration -- and committee chairpersonships. Traditionally, only the chairpersonship of the public spending watchdog, the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, is held by an opposition MP.\n\nThe extent of coalition negotiations and whether the Speaker's post is in the mix depends on how short the ANC is of a majority. The negotiating scope would differ if the ANC came in at 160 seats on the back of 40% voting support at the hustings, or 188 seats on the back of 47%.\n\nMissing, say, 13 seats for a 201 majority in the 400-strong House, and thus a governing majority, could involve a collection of one- and two-seat parties like Al Jama-ah, African Independent Congress or the National Freedom Party, should these return to the parliamentary benches. In this case, the ANC would not give up the Speaker's post. House chairpersonships that supervise committees, but also internal arrangements and international relations, and committee chairperson posts could well be sufficient to ensure an ANC-led Parliament, Cabinet and executive.\n\nIf it's a case of the ANC falling short of 41 seats for a governing majority, it becomes more tricky. If putting up the Deputy Speaker's post, or the NCOP chairpersonship, fails to be attractive to other parties in the coalition negotiations, the ANC could have its arm twisted to relinquish the Speaker's post.\n\nThis would be a last-ditch concession in a bid to hold on to power, but also a key bargaining chip in broader negotiations to elicit compromises from others. For example, the EFF could get the Speaker's post for giving up a claim to the finance ministry, or another portfolio the ANC would prefer to retain, such as defence or policing. The IFP could get the Speaker's post -- and the KwaZulu-Natal premiership -- in what that party has already described as a government of national unity.\n\nAn emerging concern for governance under the Constitution is the available choices for Speaker candidates across political party election candidate lists.\n\nIf an ANC-EFF coalition is agreed upon not only in Gauteng, but also nationally, aside from Shivambu, EFF MP Hlengiwe Mkhaliphi may be a candidate for National Assembly Speaker, given she serves in committees relating to Parliament's running.\n\nIf what unfolds is an ANC-DA coalition -- word of informal outreach has been denied all round -- would DA Chief Whip Siviwe Gwarube be put forward? Or would Freedom Front Plus Chief Whip Corn\u00e9 Mulder accept the post in a broader arrangement?\n\nIn an ANC-IFP coalition, if the Speaker's post is up for grabs, IFP Chief Whip Narend Singh may be an option, or if youth is a criterion, IFP MP Mkhuleko Hlengwa's name could be put forward.\n\nIf the ANC emerges as the majority party again, it won't give up the Speaker's post, but must face internal computations. Current House Chairperson Cedric Frolick, who was rumoured to be up for Deputy Speaker, could be considered for Speaker. Should current ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina again miss out on a place in the Cabinet, would she accept the Speaker's position?\n\nHowever, the ANC may well decide to go with a curveball in recognition of party service and loyalty in the factional battles; the Speaker's post could go to someone like former Limpopo premier Stan Mathabatha. It would not be unlike the ANC.\n\nPermutations are aplenty -- from a coalition led by the ANC or the opposition to an ANC majority of some type. Pundits' predictions of the ANC dipping below 50% on 29 May are not a given. Polling is seldom more than a snapshot of a particular moment. On the day, voter turnout is key, and the ANC has a history of kicking up enthusiasm on the last stretch of the campaign trail.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title":

There is no simple solution", "body": "The decision by the ANC to not proceed with former president Jacob Zuma's disciplinary hearing underscores how the governing party has found it impossible to manage the situation. This goes all the way back to the party electing Zuma as its president despite the conviction of Schabir Shaik for paying him a bribe.\n\nOn Sunday, ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula confirmed that he had instructed the party's National Disciplinary Committee to postpone its disciplinary hearing of former president Jacob Zuma until after the elections. He said this was because Zuma's uMkhonto Wesizwe (MK) party had said publicly its members would protest outside the ANC's headquarters in Johannesburg, Luthuli House, in support of Zuma.\n\nHowever, later on Sunday, MK spokesperson Nhlamulo Ndhlela told the SABC that MK would still go ahead with the protest.\n\nThis means that members of one party are planning to protest outside the headquarters of another party -- of which their leader is still a member.\n\nAnd they are protesting against an event which is not even happening.\n\nThis is perhaps the highest level of absurdity seen in our politics since Hlaudi Motsoeneng claimed, \"I perform miracles wherever I am\".\n\nMbalula's confirmation that the disciplinary proceedings had been postponed reveals a complex problem for the ANC: any proceedings against Zuma can tie it up in endless knots.\n\nIt is not clear that Mbalula has the power to order the National Disciplinary Committee to do anything. The very reason for its existence is that it is independent (except for the ANC's National Executive Committee, which can overrule its final decision). To obey orders given by the secretary-general negates the reason for its existence.\n\nThere are other problems.\n\nThe ANC's charge sheet against Zuma, lodged only last week, stipulates: \"On 16th December 2023, you addressed the Umkhonto we Sizwe Party (MKP) in Soweto and you called on all South Africans to join you in dislodging the ANC as the ruling party.\"\n\nWhile this cannot be disputed, the ANC must explain why it waited until May to finally act against Zuma -- in the middle of an election campaign.\n\nIf he said this on 16 December, why was he not charged the next day?\n\nThis is the kind of gap through which Dali Mpofu can drive an 18-wheel truck.\n\nIf the ANC had acted immediately, it would have had a stronger case. It is paying the price for yet another in the string of inexplicable failures to act against Zuma that has beset it for years.\n\nHowever, the ANC has an easier option than hauling Zuma before the National Disciplinary Committee. At some point, his membership will have to be reviewed as part of the annual cycle (the ANC website says the current membership fee is R20 to be paid \"annually\"). The party can simply refuse to accept his money when the time comes, on the basis that he belongs to another party.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that had the hearing gone ahead, it could have sparked clashes outside Luthuli House.\n\nIn 2011, when disciplinary proceedings were started against ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, several thousand people gathered outside Luthuli House, ostensibly to defend him. The result was a day of violence in the Johannesburg city centre, with Malema's supporters throwing stones at the police while he watched from atop Luthuli House, surrounded by his lieutenants.\n\nThe area outside Luthuli House resembled a war zone. But, inside the ANC headquarters, then ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe welcomed journalists with offers of bottles of water. It was a fascinating moment when the interests of the media and Mantashe were aligned.\n\nIn 2011, Malema was still maturing as a political leader and his support was relatively unproven.\n\nZuma is very different. The violence that claimed more than 300 lives in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng came just days after he was jailed in 2021. The very presence of MK in this election has led to fears that there could be more incidents of violence in KZN before voting day.\n\nZuma has never disavowed this infamous day of destruction that was committed in his name.\n\nThe ANC has to tread carefully.\n\nIt should be remembered, though, that the ANC itself is to blame for its predicament.\n\nIf its leaders had not taken the decisions to strongly support Zuma through each and every scandal while he was in office, MK would not have the power it has now.\n\nIf the ANC had acted against Zuma when he fired Nhlanhla Nene in 2015, or during the Nkandla scandal, or when it became clear the Guptas were looting South Africa, none of this would be happening now.\n\nIt was the political decision that the ANC made to treat every criticism of Zuma as an attack on the party that has made him so powerful.\n\nIt was the ANC that elected him as its leader despite the many warnings about his conduct. ANC delegates voted for Zuma at Polokwane in 2007, despite the conviction of Schabir Shaik for paying him a bribe in 2005, allowing Zuma to enable State Capture.\n\nThe ANC's current leadership must shoulder some of the blame.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has repeatedly claimed the ANC is going through a process of \"renewal\" -- but he has appointed to his government people found to have been involved in State Capture.\n\nHe has not explained why he chose to do this, instead claiming that \"processes\" have to play out.\n\nAppointing someone implicated in wrongdoing is a political choice. Either Ramaphosa appointed David Mahlobo and Zizi Kodwa because he wanted to, or because the internal politics of the ANC forced him to. He also appointed ANC Chair Gwede Mantashe to his Cabinet, but Mantashe has instituted legal action to review the Zondo Commission's findings against him and appeared before the ANC's Integrity Commission, which cleared him of wrongdoing.\n\nIf Ramaphosa made the appointments because he wanted to, he is not committed to the renewal of the ANC.\n\nAnd if he did so because the ANC forced him to, the party is not committed to renewal.\n\nIt is likely that Zuma and MK will continue to use the charges against him as a campaigning tool and that the ANC will continue to suffer as a result.\n\nThis has been years in the making and there is no simple solution to the \"Zuma problem\" for the ANC.

Mbeki said the counter-revolution has caused suffering to citizens.\"\n\nHe cited the call of ANC's 2024 elections manifesto for \"ensuring that the ANC public representatives and deployees are held accountable for the basic services to communities\".\n\nThe question Mbeki left open, though, was: how can politicians be made accountable to ourselves, the voters? Our problem is that the electoral system under three decades of ANC government blocks the individual accountability of MPs, provincial councillors and also leaders of state enterprises to us, the citizens of South Africa.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: 2024 elections hub\n\nThe ANC manifesto talks of building a \"developmental and ethical State, led by honest, dedicated and capable leaders\", but how can that happen when MPs and provincial councillors are appointed by party bosses, and not elected by name by local voters, who can get rid of them when they fail us?\n\nMbeki said that the ANC must build and entrench \"strong ethical foundations\" to \"end lawlessness, violence against the person, including gender-based violence, as well as a pernicious individualism which leads to looting, corruption and all manner of criminal abuse\".\n\nThis is true. But it's not possible to achieve this under the present Electoral Act. There is no guarantee that any new leadership will meet these minimum standards.\n\nIt has just been revealed that Fikile Mbalula, the ANC secretary general, has admitted that the lists of candidates submitted to the Independent Electoral Commission were tampered with. Without trustworthy leaders accountable as individuals in elections, Mbeki's wishes remain an illusion and a pipe dream.\n\nThe reality is that when we as school students rose up to challenge the might of the apartheid state in 1976, our focus was on establishing one person, one vote of equal value for all the citizens of South Africa. This meant the right to directly elect our leaders.\n\nWe fought for equal rights for all the citizens of South Africa, black and white, but the goal of equal rights for all citizens remains elusive today. The class of 1976 has lost the ball and the focus.\n\nWe still do not have the same rights the whites had under apartheid. One person one vote of equal value for electing our leaders remains elusive.\n\nThe initial parliamentary electoral laws adopted in 1994 were understood to be temporary and not permanent, but they have been kept for three decades by subsequent ANC governments, despite several proposals to change them.\n\nIn 1999 the Electoral Task Team, chaired by Dr Frederick Van Zyl Slabbert, was set up to explore preferable parliamentary electoral laws for South Africa. When the Electoral Task Team presented its report in January 2003, it had two main recommendations: the minority recommendations and the majority recommendations.\n\nThe minority recommendations proposed a 100% proportional representation electoral system, also known as the closed list system, in which citizens are only allowed to vote for political parties. The citizens have no rights to choose their members of Parliament themselves, they cannot choose their President, and they cannot choose their provincial premiers and their mayors. All these government officials are appointed by political parties without the participation and input of the citizens themselves. The citizens are treated like children, with no right to choose the members of Parliament by name and constituency.\n\nLet the people decide! This is the only way to make a success of former President Thabo Mbeki's excellent proposal for a National Dialogue.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240618758323/en/\n\nPart of Desktop Metal's Live Suite software portfolio, Live Inspect allows manufacturers to dial in accuracy and 3D print parts that hit higher tolerances. The software analyzes features on a 3D scan -- such as holes, slots, and planar surfaces -- and provides tolerance analysis according to standard geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) norms and practices. Live Inspect then automatically applies feature-level scan adjustments that correct for deviations identified by the tolerance-based scan analysis.\n\nMany users of additive technologies use 3D scanners to verify part tolerances. While some tools provide an analysis of these scans, Live Inspect both analyzes and corrects for 3D printing variations.\n\n\"Our team developed Live Inspect with the goal of delivering 3D printed results as true to CAD designs as possible,\" said Ric Fulop, Desktop Metal Co-Founder and CEO. \"This solution can affect how compensation is applied to 3D scans through user-identified datums that allows them to fine tune prints and hit higher tolerances in production.\"\n\nFor users of Team DM binder jetting platforms, Live Inspect enhances the capabilities of Live Sinter, Desktop Metal's revolutionary sintering simulation and compensation software.\n\nHowever, Live Inspect is not just a solution for powder metal shrinkage and distortion due to density variations, gravity, and friction during sintering, but can also aid in the manufacturing of polymer parts that experience warping due to curing and thermal effects or sandcasting cores swelling due to microwave curing. The software will be available as an added feature bundled with Live Sinter for metal binder jetting operators as well as a stand-alone option for users of other platforms and additive technologies.\n\nLive Inspect will be introduced as part of Desktop Metal's display at Rapid + TCT in Los Angeles June 25-27, North America's largest additive manufacturing and industrial 3D printing event. Desktop Metal is located in Booth No. 2139 on the main promenade and will showcase a wide range of its AM 2.0 technologies for metal, polymers, and ceramics.\n\nFor more information on the Desktop Metal Live Inspect software visit TeamDM.com/LiveInspect\n\nAbout Desktop Metal\n\nDesktop Metal (NYSE:DM) is driving Additive Manufacturing 2.0, a new era of on-demand, digital mass production of industrial, medical, and consumer products.

While useful for identifying areas where a part may not be within tolerance, these maps lack further information for a precise quality assessment or corrective actions. Live Inspect users overcome these limitations by offering detailed GD&T-style tolerance analysis for individual features such as holes, slots, and planes.

Customers interested in co-developing aluminum parts for production binder jet 3D printing applications are encouraged to reach out to Desktop Metal at TeamDM.com/X25Pro_Al6061.\n\nBenefits of Binder Jet 3D Printing\n\nBinder Jetting is widely regarded as the fastest method of metal 3D printing for high-volume output. This technology uses a digital file to quickly inkjet a binder into a bed of powder particles such as metal, sand, or ceramic to create a solid part, one thin layer at a time. When printing metals, the final bound metal part must be sintered in a furnace to fuse the particles together into a solid object. Ceramics, such as silicon carbide, can be sintered or infiltrated using a variety of methods.\n\nBinder jet 3D printing, compared to both traditional manufacturing and other forms of 3D printing, enables manufacturers to more affordably produce complex parts with unique benefits, such as size and weight reductions, part consolidation, and performance improvements.\n\nBecause of the broad material flexibility of binder jet 3D printing, Desktop Metal employs a tiered qualification system for production of powdered materials, identifying materials as R&D Qualified, Customer-Qualified for specific applications, and DM Qualified for standard use. In all, more than 30 metals and ceramics are qualified on DM printers.\n\nFor more information about laser-free 3D printing with binder jetting, visit TeamDM.com/BJTguide.\n\nAbout Desktop Metal\n\nDesktop Metal (NYSE:DM) is driving Additive Manufacturing 2.0, a new era of on-demand, digital mass production of industrial, medical, and consumer products. Our innovative 3D printers, materials, and software deliver the speed, cost, and part quality required for this transformation.

The FTC will continue working to protect Americans from these illegal business practices.\u201d According to a civil enforcement action filed against the company and two top executives, Maninder Sawhney and David Wadhwani, in California federal court, Adobe used a number of practices to lock consumers into pricey subscriptions, violating the Restore Online Shoppers\u2019 Confidence Act. The company allegedly used fine print, optional text boxes, and a maze of hyperlinks to conceal an essentially secret early termination fee that charged users half the value of their remaining annual contracts to cancel, a penalty that could amount to hundreds of dollars, according to the suit. Those who did want to cancel their plans faced other obstacles, according to officials. \u201cSome users who tried to cancel by contacting customer service would have their calls drop or disconnect and then have to re-explain everything all over again,\u201d FTC chair Lina Khan said in a statement on Monday on X. \u201cOthers would be stuck in an endless loop of transfers across various Adobe representatives.\u201d The federal official said such policies make it \u201cabsurdly\u201d hard to get out of an Adobe subscription. One customer described in the suit claimed, \u201cAdobe literally will not let me cancel my subscription. The Independent has contacted Adobe for comment. Before 2012, Adobe typically sold its software with perpetual licenses, allowing users to pay once for lifetime use. Then, the company shifted to a subscription model, charging users a regular monthly or yearly fee to maintain their access. The decision yielded huge returns. Between 2019 and 2023, Adobe\u2019s subscription-based revenue almost doubled, growing from $7.71bn to $14.22bn, according to the suit.", "summary": "<p>Company is accused of making it nearly impossible to cancel annual subscription to popular products </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/doj-ftc-adobe-photoshop-lawsuit-b2564294.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/17/11/adobe.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/WAjtfZ6G-OhrQWqOm.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:05:44", "author": "Josh Marcus", "authors": ["Josh Marcus"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.585}

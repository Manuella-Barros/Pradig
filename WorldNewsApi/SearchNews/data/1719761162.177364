{"id": 225054196, "title": "Supreme Court Could Upend America's Clean Water Rules", "text": "The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency's new water rules.In April, President Joe Biden's administration and the EPA introduced national limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in drinking water. These PFAS, or \"forever chemicals,\" have been linked to health concerns such as cancer.While some states have already set limits on the amount of PFAS in drinking water, the new restrictions are the first to be implemented nationwide. The EPA estimated that of the 66,000 public drinking water systems subject to the new limits, between 6 and 10 percent would need to take action to meet the updated standards.On May 28, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the City and County of San Francisco's case against the EPA, in which it argues that the agency's discharge rules are too vague, as they do not set a quantifiable, numerical standard.The EPA's Clean Water Act changes say discharges that \"cause or contribute to a violation of any applicable water quality standard\" will not be allowed.Lawyers for San Francisco wrote in their petition: \"Rather than specify pollutant limits that tell the permitholder how much they need to control their discharges as required by the CWA, these prohibitions effectively tell permitholders nothing more than not to cause 'too much' pollution.\"These generic water quality terms expose San Francisco and numerous permitholders nationwide to enforcement actions while failing to tell them how much they need to limit or treat their discharges to comply with the Act.\"San Francisco says the EPA's \"narrative\" regulations fall short of the Clean Water Act's requirement to define restrictions.Jen Kwart, the city's director of communications, wrote in a statement: \"We simply want to know in advance what requirements apply to us, and we want the EPA to fulfil its duty under the Clean Water Act to determine those requirements. That is fair.\"The EPA had urged the Supreme Court to decline the petition, insisting narrative limitations were within its right. Newsweek has contacted the agency for comment via email.Lawyers for the agency wrote that Section 1311 of the Clean Water Act \"requires the achievement of 'effluent limitations' and 'any more stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality standards.'\"The Supreme Court has ruled against the EPA in the past\u2014including in 2022, when it decided, in a 6-3 ruling, against Biden's climate agenda.Chief Justice John Roberts wrote at the time: \"Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible 'solution to the crisis of the day.'\"But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme. A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.\"", "summary": "San Francisco has taken the Environmental Protection Agency to court over rules the city says are \"too vague.\"", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/supreme-court-san-francisco-environmental-protection-agency-epa-water-pfas-1905791", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400572/stock-photo-glass-water.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:24:26", "author": "Jordan King", "authors": ["Jordan King"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.052}

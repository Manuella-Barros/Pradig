While nearly three-quarters of those killed have been males, it is worth noting that the rate of death among females is climbing year over year: 23 deaths per 100,000 in 2024, compared with 20.6 deaths per 100,000 females for all of 2023,\" the service said Tuesday.\n\n\"For British Columbians between 10 and 59, unregulated drug toxicity is the leading cause of death, accounting for more deaths than homicides, suicides, accidents and natural disease combined.

These were people with hopes, dreams and stories cut tragically short by a crisis that continues to challenge us deeply,\" she said.\n\n\"These losses underscore the urgency with which we must continue to respond to this public-health emergency.

They did not have the services that were needed to provide to even give this a chance of being successful.\"\n\nB.C. is more than a year into its three-year pilot, giving a Criminal Code exemption for personal possession of up to 2.5 grams of drugs such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines.\n\nThe province previously tried to make drug use illegal in public places with its own legislation, but the Harm Reduction Nurses Association challenged the bill in court.\n\nChief Justice Christopher Hinkson ruled in December that if the laws were enacted, \"irreparable harm will be caused.\"\n\nPremier David Eby said instead of waiting for the case to be appealed through the courts, the province would request the now-approved Health Canada exception.\n\nThe Harm Reduction Nurses Association said in a statement Tuesday that it was \"deeply concerned and frustrated\" by Health Canada's decision, saying the move targets those who are \"at greatest risk of fatal drug poisoning.\"\n\n\"Today's decision is an improper circumvention of the BC Supreme Court order and will directly jeopardize the health and safety of B.C.'s most marginalized,\" the association's statement said.\n\n\"We know that criminalizing drug use will lead to irreparable harm, and we know that irreparable harm can mean death. We urge the federal government to reconsider this reckless policy regression.\"\n\nAt least 14,400 people have died since the provincial government declared a public-health emergency in April 2016.\n\nThe BC Coroners Service said in its statement Tuesday that the overdose death rate makes illicit drugs the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 and 59, surpassing accidents, suicide, homicides and natural causes combined.\n\nIt noted the nearly 200 illicit drug deaths in March marked an 11-per-cent decrease from the same month last year.\n\nAt least 572 people died in the first three months of this year, and fentanyl has been detected in 85 per cent of the unregulated drug deaths that have undergone toxicology testing.\n\nAbout three-quarters of those killed in March were male, although the service says the death rate among females is climbing year-over-year, with 23 deaths per 100,000 compared with just over 20 last year.\n\nWhiteside said in a news release reacting to the March statistics that the losses underscore the urgency of continuing to respond to the public-health emergency.\n\n\"A crucial part of our work is reducing barriers so that more people can be connected to the care they need, where and when they need it,\" she said.\n\n- With files from Brieanna Charlebois in Vancouver\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSolicitor General Mike Farnworth said at a separate news conference that the changes are a result of hearing the concerns of communities, the public and police in terms of dealing with drug use in public spaces.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Decriminalization was never about using drugs in public, ever,\" he said. \"Addiction is a health matter, not a criminal justice one, but that doesn't mean anything goes.\"\n\nHe thanked Health Canada for the change, saying public drug use is no longer permitted in public spaces including inside hospitals, on transit and in parks.\n\n\"When police are called to a scene where illegal and dangerous drug use is taking place, they will have the ability to compel a person to leave the area, seize the drugs when necessary or arrest the person if required,\" he said, adding that provincewide guidance and training will be provided to all B.C. officers.\n\nMental Health and Addictions Minister Jennifer Whiteside said people want safe communities but they also want their friends and family members to be able to call for help without fear.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOpposition BC United addictions critic Elenore Sturko said the province's decriminalization plan failed to help people get the treatment they need and now the government has passed the issue off to the police.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We need to find a way in B.C. and Canada to look at other models around the world,\" she said. \"Right now we have a system that has utterly failed from the outset. They did not have the services that were needed to provide to even give this a chance of being successful.\"\n\nB.C. is more than a year into its three-year pilot, giving a Criminal Code exemption for personal possession of up to 2.5 grams of drugs such as heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines.\n\nThe province previously tried to make drug use illegal in public places with its own legislation, but the Harm Reduction Nurses Association challenged the bill in court.\n\nChief Justice Christopher Hinkson ruled in December that if the laws were enacted, \"irreparable harm will be caused.\"\n\nPremier David Eby said instead of waiting for the case to be appealed through the courts, the province would request the now-approved Health Canada exception.\n\nThe Harm Reduction Nurses Association said in a statement Tuesday that it was \"deeply concerned and frustrated\" by Health Canada's decision, saying the move targets those who are \"at greatest risk of fatal drug poisoning.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Today's decision is an improper circumvention of the BC Supreme Court order and will directly jeopardize the health and safety of B.C.'s most marginalized,\" the association's statement said.\n\n\"We know that criminalizing drug use will lead to irreparable harm, and we know that irreparable harm can mean death. We urge the federal government to reconsider this reckless policy regression.\"\n\nAt least 14,400 people have died since the provincial government declared a public-health emergency in April 2016.\n\nThe BC Coroners Service said in its statement Tuesday that the overdose death rate makes illicit drugs the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 and 59, surpassing accidents, suicide, homicides and natural causes combined.\n\nIt noted the nearly 200 illicit drug deaths in March marked an 11-per-cent decrease from the same month last year.\n\nAt least 572 people died in the first three months of this year, and fentanyl has been detected in 85 per cent of the unregulated drug deaths that have undergone toxicology testing.\n\nAbout three-quarters of those killed in March were male, although the service says the death rate among females is climbing year-over-year, with 23 deaths per 100,000 compared with just over 20 last year.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhiteside said in a news release reacting to the March statistics that the losses underscore the urgency of continuing to respond to the public-health emergency.\n\n\"A crucial part of our work is reducing barriers so that more people can be connected to the care they need, where and when they need it,\" she said.\n\n- With files from Brieanna Charlebois in Vancouver\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press

Coroners Office.\n\nPrince Rupert reported five unregulated drug deaths in 2023, with no deaths reported in the first quarter of 2024. Among the 2023 deaths, four were males, one was female, and one of these deaths occurred outdoors.\n\nThat puts the city at 33.6 deaths per 100,000 population, among the lowest in the Northern Health region last year.\n\nElsewhere in the Northwest, Terrace is one of the hardest-hit communities in the province grappling with the impact of unregulated drug deaths\n\nIn 2023, Terrace reported 22 unregulated drug deaths, a trend that has persisted in 2024, with three deaths reported from January to March.\n\nWith 22 deaths last year, the city remained the second-highest death rate per 100,000 population in the province at 93.9, second only to Vancouver Centre North, which had a staggering rate of 552.4 in 2023.\n\nOf the reported Terrace deaths, 90 per cent occurred indoors, predominantly in private residences, social and supportive housing, SROs, shelters and hotels. This percentage is higher than the provincial average of 84 per cent indoor deaths.\n\nIn 2023, Out of the 22 deaths, eight were females and 14 were males.\n\nThis mirrors the provincial trend of increasing female unregulated drug deaths, with rates climbing from 13 per 100,000 population in 2020 to 23 per 100,0000 in 2023 and is particularly pronounced in the Northern Health Authority region (57 deaths per 100,000) and Island Health Authority (32 deaths per 100,000)\n\nIn 2023, Kitimat reported nine unregulated drug deaths, with an additional three deaths from January to March 2024. Among the 2023 deaths, seven were males and two were females, all occurring indoors.\n\nThe district was also among the highest rates per 100,000 population at 92.1.\n\nSmithers recorded a total of eight deaths in 2023, and four from January to March of 2024 a disturbing trend for the town of 5,000 people. Among the deaths in 2023, five were females and three were males, with one reported as an outdoor death.\n\nOverall, the rate in B.C is 40 deaths per 100,0000 population so far in 2024, showing a slight decrease from 45.7 per 100,000 in 2023.\n\nThe most common mode of consumption province-wide in 2024 is smoking (72 per cent), followed by nasal inflation (14 per cent), injection (12 per cent) and oral (six per cent).\n\nIn 2023-2024, fentanyl was detected in 85 per cent, cocaine in 48 per cent, methamphetamine in 45 per cent and hydromorphone in three per cent of unregulated drug deaths that have undergone expedited toxicology testing.\n\nThe number of unregulated drug deaths in March 2024 equates to about 6.2 deaths per day across the province.

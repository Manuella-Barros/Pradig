"body": "Less than half of young people are watching live television each week\n\nCasey Cooper-Fiske, PA Entertainment Reporter\n\n31 July 2024 at 1:01 am\n\nLess than half of young people watch live television in the average week, a new study has revealed.\n\nResearch by Ofcom found that just 48% of young people tuned in to live TV each week in 2023, which represented a drop off from 76% in 2018.\n\nThose aged between 16 and 24 were found to watch just 20 minutes of television each week, while those aged between 25 and 34 watch television for 35 minutes in the average week.\n\nThe media regulator's research found that most young people opted to watch video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and TikTok instead.\n\nAs many as 93% of those aged 16 to 24 watch a video streaming platform in the average week, while 63% of those aged between 25 and 34 also opt for the likes of TikTok and YouTube over traditional TV.\n\nThose in the 16 to 24 age group reported watching one hour and 33 minutes of content on video-sharing platforms, while those in the 25 to 34 age group reported watching an hour and three minutes of shared content each week.\n\nMiddle-aged viewers, aged between 45 and 54, have also begun to turn away from linear television, with viewing rates in the age group falling from 89% to 84% in a single year.\n\nBut despite figures showing that traditional viewing is falling, people in the UK watched more TV and video content at home in 2023 than in the previous year, averaging four hours and 31 minutes a day.\n\nOfcom says the TV set \"remains at the heart of household viewing\", but said an increase in its use was being primarily driven by an uptick in the viewing of video-sharing platforms, which rose by 12% between 2022 and 2023.\n\nThere has also been an increase in those viewing broadcasters' on-demand services such as ITVX and BBC iPlayer, which rose 29% between 2022 and 2023.\n\nBut while traditional television is losing its grip on household leisure time, radio is making a comeback.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, radio saw its highest number of weekly listeners across all devices in the past 20 years, with just under 50 million tuning in.\n\nOfcom said this was due to the fact it was attracting new audiences and increasing its average hours per listener, with just over seven in 10 people aged 15 and above tuning into commercial stations at least once a week.\n\nStreaming services saw a marginal rise in viewers, up 6% between 2022 and 2023, with Netflix remaining the most popular service, as viewers spend an average of 21 minutes a week on the platform.\n\nTraditional television remains popular among older audiences, with those aged 65 and above watching more than four hours of television every week.\n\nLive national and international events have topped the tables of the most popular TV broadcasts, with the Euro 2024 final between England and Spain attracting 15.1 million viewers across the BBC and ITV.\n\nSpeaking about the figures, Ian Macrae, Ofcom's director of market intelligence said: \"Gen Z and Alpha are used to swiping and streaming, not flipping through broadcast TV channels.\n\n\"They crave the flexibility, immediacy and choice that on-demand services offer, spending over three hours a day watching video, but only 20 minutes of live TV.\n\n\"It's no surprise that the traditional TV is fast becoming a device of choice to watch YouTube.\n\n\"But while live TV may not have the universal pull it once did, its role in capturing those big moments that bring the nation together remains vital.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "casey_cooper_fiske@aol.co.uk", "name": "Casey Cooper-Fiske", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Similarly, children aged 4-15 are tuning out at a comparable rate, with only 55% watching broadcast TV weekly in 2023, compared to 81% in 2018. Overall, the weekly reach of traditional TV declined by a record amount in the past year.\n\nThe decline in weekly reach among middle-aged viewers (45-54s) also accelerated, falling from 89% to 84% in a single year. In contrast, there has been relatively little change among loyal older audiences aged 65+, with around 95% continuing to tune in to broadcast TV each week.\n\nYounger audiences aged 16-24 aren't just watching broadcast TV less frequently, they're also watching for shorter periods at only 33 minutes each day - down 16% year on year. Of this, a mere 20 minutes is spent watching live TV.\n\nIn comparison, they're spending three times as long each day (1 hour 33 minutes) watching video-sharing platforms such as TikTok and YouTube.\n\nOverall, people in the UK watched more TV and video content at home in 2023, averaging 4 hours and 31 minutes a day (an increase of 6 minutes/2% since 2022). This was primarily driven by an increase in daily viewing to video-sharing platforms (up 12% to 49 minutes) and to broadcasters' video-on-demand services, such as iPlayer and ITVX (up 29% to 20 minutes).\n\nThe TV set remains at the heart of household viewing, accounting for 84% of TV and video content watched at home in 2023. TV screens are also rapidly becoming more popular for watching YouTube content. Thirty-four percent of time spent watching YouTube at home is now on a TV set - up from 29% in 2022.

Listening time is also up year on year to an average of 20.5 hours per week.\n\nMuch of this growth is down to commercial radio's continued success in attracting new audiences and increasing its average hours per listener. Just over seven in 10 people aged 15+ tune into commercial stations at least once a week (70.4 per cent) compared to 55.6 per cent for BBC stations. Commercial radio revenue continued to grow in 2023, up 2 per cent overall to \u00a3667 million.\n\nAfter live radio, the next most popular type of audio is streamed music from services such as Spotify, Apple and Amazon, with half listening to these services at least once a week (50 per cent). The proportion of adults listening to podcasts each week has almost doubled in the past five years to one in every five.\n\nOnline radio listening continues to grow steadily, overtaking analogue radio (AM/FM) for the first time this year and now accounting for over a quarter (28 per cent) of all live radio hours, mostly through smart speakers.", "source": {"uri": "advanced-television.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Advanced-television"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_Run:_Dawn_of_the_Nugget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITVX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITVX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_speaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smart speaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year's_Eve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Year's Eve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Production_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Production Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://advanced-television.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Young-watching.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777562", "eventUri": "eng-9777562", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-14", "textStart": 3098, "textEnd": 3107}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile the fall in weekly reach among middle-aged viewers accelerated, declining from 89 per cent to 84 per cent in 2023.\n\nStill, analysts believe the decline among younger viewers is \"slowing\", with the use of streaming and video-sharing services \"plateauing\".\n\nBy the end of the decade the decline in watching TV from broadcasters \"won't be anywhere near the drop that has happened recently\", said Tom Harrington, TV analyst at Enders Analysis.\n\nRadio listening meanwhile hit a 20-year high: the first quarter of 2024 rose from a year earlier to generate the highest number of weekly audiences across all devices.\n\nOfcom attributed much of the growth to commercial radio's success in attracting new audiences and increasing its average hours per listener.\n\nEvent TV, such as the King's coronation at 12mn, drew in high viewership figures.\n\n\"While live TV may not have the universal pull it once did, its role in capturing those big moments that bring the nation together remains vital,\" said Macrae.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free-to-air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronation of the British monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_video_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online video platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_licence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television licence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Production_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Production Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2F__origami%2Fservice%2Fimage%2Fv2%2Fimages%2Fraw%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%252Fproduction%252Fa9aa1b55-8216-4ae8-87e9-edc355f8f484.jpg%3Fsource%3Dnext-article%26fit%3Dscale-down%26quality%3Dhighest%26width%3D700%26dpr%3D1?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777562", "eventUri": "eng-9777562", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The weekly reach of the sector fell by a record amount in the last year, from 79% in 2022 to 75% in 2023, a second consecutive year of record decline.\n\nChildren aged 4- to 15-years old are swerving broadcasters, with only 55% watching in 2023 compared to 81% in 2018. The decline in weekly reach among middle-aged viewers (45 to 54) also accelerated, falling from 89% to 84% in a single year.\n\nYounger audiences aren't just watching traditional TV less frequently, they're also watching for shorter periods at only 33 minutes each day - down 16% year-on-year. Of this, a mere 20 minutes is spent watching live TV.\n\nIn stark contrast, video-sharing platforms (VSPs) including YouTube continue their rise to dominance. Gen Z and Gen A viewers spend three times longer each day (1hr 33mins) watching VSPs than terrestrial shows.\n\nVSPs are also driving overall consumption of TV and video content in UK households. Viewing figures for VSPs were up 12% to 49 minutes per day - contributing to an overall 4hrs 31mins a day of TV and video viewing, up six minutes and 2% since 2022.\n\nYouTube has established itself as the market leader among the VSPs primarily because it is available to watch on living room TV sets, while rivals such as TikTok remain mostly phone app based.\n\nOfcom reports that 34% of time spent watching YouTube at home is now on a TV set - up from 29% in 2022. This increases to 45% among children aged 4- to 15-years-old, rising from 36% in 2022.\n\nYouTube's growing challenge to the traditional TV model is no secret to executives in the kids' content sector, who have warned of a mass exodus of younger viewers to online platforms for years now.\n\nIt was the hot topic at the Children's Media Conference in Sheffield earlier this month.\n\nMichael Rose, joint MD of animation prodco Magic Light Pictures, said: \"We have a crisis in children's media and there is a tremendous strain on the established platforms from YouTube, TikTok and other new online places.\n\n\"That has serious implications for how high-quality public service children's content is going to be funded, where it's going to be found and how children today are going to view it.\"\n\nEarlier in the year, media commentator Evan Shapiro warned that the entire TV ecosystem - not just the kids' sector - has been severely disrupted by YouTube.\n\n\"YouTube is the biggest TV channel on the planet and one of the biggest competitors for eyeballs in the TV ecosystem,\" he said.\n\n\"It poses a truly existential threat from an audience retention and revenue standpoint.\"\n\nOfcom's report shows that daily viewing of SVoD services saw marginal growth in 2023, up 6% to 38 minutes. Netflix remains the most popular OTT platform - watched for an average of 21 minutes per person per day, and accounting for more than half of all SVoD viewing.\n\nBroadcaster video-on-demand (BVoD) offerings, such as BBC iPlayer and ITVX, rose by 29% to 20 minutes per person.\n\nTotal commercial TV and online revenue was marginally up in 2023, increasing by 0.5% to \u00a315.6bn (US$20.02bn). The 20% increase in online video revenue to \u00a35.4bn, mainly driven by SVoDs, was almost cancelled out by the 7.5% decline across commercial broadcast and pay TV, down to \u00a310.2bn.\n\nThe greatest revenue decreases were among the public service broadcasters (PSBs) and digital multichannel services. They suffered declines of 16% and 10% respectively, to fall below 2020 levels.\n\nSpending on original first run shows by the PSBs totalled \u00a32.7bn last year, down 5.3% from 2022, but still 8.1% higher than the last pre-pandemic year, 2019.\n\nOverall advertising expenditure increased by 5.3% to \u00a336.6bn, again driven by online growth which rose by \u00a32.6bn (10%). Social video on platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, accounted for around \u00a3900m of this rise, up some 20% since 2022.\n\nIan Macrae, director of market intelligence, Ofcom, said: \"Gen Z and Alpha are used to swiping and streaming, not flipping through broadcast TV channels.\n\n\"They crave the flexibility, immediacy and choice that on-demand services offer, spending over three hours a day watching video, but only 20 minutes of live TV. It's no surprise that the traditional TV is fast becoming a device of choice to watch YouTube.\"", "source": {"uri": "c21media.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "C21Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITVX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITVX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal_Television_and_Streaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal Television and Streaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-top media service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_iPlayer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC iPlayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pay television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.c21media.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ian-macrae.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777562", "eventUri": "eng-9777562", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Fewer than half of 16-24year-olds in the UK are now watching broadcast TV in an average week.\n\nIn comparison, for the UK, this age group are spending on average one hour 33 minutes each day watching video-sharing platforms such as YouTube and TikTok.\n\nOfcom's research also showed that overall, Scots watched on average five hours of video content at home per person per day.

While this is marginally lower than the UK as a whole (89 per cent), total listening in Scotland increased from 74.2 million to 77.4 million hours.\n\nFewer people are tuning in each week, but those who do are listening for longer.\n\nMost of this listening was to commercial radio, such as Tay FM, Original 106 and Nation Radio Scotland, which in Scotland was higher than for the UK as a whole.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_VI", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George VI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Valley_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Happy Valley (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_British_monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronation of the British monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurovision Song Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strictly Come Dancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Caledonian_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow Caledonian University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston,_Lancashire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Preston, Lancashire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_106_(Aberdeen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Original 106 (Aberdeen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay_FM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tay FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Commercials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2010-london-england-bbc-worldwide-852588559.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777562", "eventUri": "eng-9777562", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

On-demand is where TV is rapidly growing - which is why every TV company has been devoting so much energy and investment in developing on-demand services.\n\n\"And this strategy is paying off - as Ofcom's report shows, on-demand TV is growing more than any other type of video, YouTube and TikTok included.\"\n\nOfcom's research also revealed that viewing on broadcasters' streaming platforms, such as BBC iPlayer and ITV, grew by almost 30pc last year to 20 minutes per person each day.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to compensate for the large decline in audiences across traditional TV channels.\n\nTikTok has grown rapidly since its launch in the UK in 2018 and is now used by 22m Britons at least once a month, according to data from SensorTower.\n\nSeparate figures from Data.AI showed the average UK smartphone user spent 36 hours and three minutes per month scrolling TikTok videos last month.\n\nMeanwhile, YouTube is continuing to grow in popularity almost two decades after its launch.\n\nFigures show that the average person spent 38 minutes on YouTube every day at the end of last year, compared to 31 minutes at the beginning of 2022.\n\nBy contrast, the weekly reach of terrestrial TV fell from 79pc to 75pc last year - the second consecutive year of record decline.\n\nWhile the drop in viewing is being felt across all age groups, the slump is most dramatic among Gen Z audiences.\n\nIn addition to watching traditional TV less frequently, young viewers are also watching for shorter periods of time.\n\nOn average, Gen Z viewers watch broadcast TV for just 33 minutes a day - down 16pc year on year.\n\nBy contrast, Ofgem found 16 to 24-year olds are spending an hour and 33 minutes each day watching online video platforms such as TikTok and YouTube.\n\nThe decline is so acute that many younger viewers have abandoned terrestrial TV altogether, with an estimated 5.3m households only accessing TV via the internet.\n\nIan Macrae, Ofcom's director of market intelligence, said: \"Gen Z and Alpha [children born between 2008 and 2024] are used to swiping and streaming, not flipping through broadcast TV channels.\n\n\"They crave the flexibility, immediacy and choice that on-demand services offer, spending over three hours a day watching video, but only 20 minutes of live TV. It's no surprise that the traditional TV is fast becoming a device of choice to watch YouTube.\"\n\nThe decline in viewing figures has prompted soul-searching at broadcasters as bosses try to win back audiences.\n\nThe BBC, which lost half a million licence fee payers last year, has increased its focus on British storytelling. All broadcasters, including Channel 4 and ITV, are increasingly investing in their streaming services as viewers move online.\n\nHowever, Ofcom has warned that terrestrial TV is at a \"tipping point\", with a growing risk that older audiences could be left behind by the shift to streaming. Weekly reach among over-65s remains relatively stable at 95pc.\n\nDespite the broader decline, traditional broadcasters also remain the go-to destination for major national and international events.\n\nThe BBC's coverage of the New Year's Eve fireworks was the most-watched programme last year, attracting an audience of 12.1m.\n\nThis was closely followed by the Coronation of the King, while the Eurovision Song Contest was watched by more than 10m people.\n\nEngland's defeat to Spain in the Euro 2024 final has been the biggest event of the year so far, with the BBC and ITV drawing a combined audience of more than 15m.\n\nWhile traditional broadcasters continue to shed audiences, there are also indications that growth among US streaming giants is slowing.\n\nOfcom found that the take-up of subscription streaming services such as Netflix has levelled out at just over two thirds of households, returning to the peak it achieved in early 2020.\n\nViewing data from ratings agency Barb show the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 all outpaced their streaming rivals for viewing minutes in the first half of the year.\n\nBut traditional TV channels are still battling a fall in advertising revenues, with the recent downturn prompting ITV and Channel 4 to slash jobs.\n\nOfcom's report showed the decline in terrestrial TV advertising spend offset growth in streaming revenues, as total TV ad spend fell by 8.9pc to \u00a34.9bn.\n\nMeanwhile, price rises helped subscription revenues for US streaming giants rise 22pc to just under \u00a34bn, while the companies also pulled in around \u00a350m from new advertising tiers.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_warrington@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "James

Operating profit rose to 10.4tn won (\u00a35.8bn) in April-June, up from 670bn won a year earlier, Samsung said.\n\nThe company is the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones, televisions and memory chips. It is the latter that has been behind its recent profit surge - although it is also counting on increased AI features to sell more of its top-end phones.\n\nShare prices of companies with links to artificial intelligence have boomed in recent years as investors try to work out who the big winners will be. Top among those companies have been the chip manufacturers and designers, although some of the enthusiasm appears to have waned in recent weeks. Nvidia, the biggest beneficiary, has fallen by 20% from its peak as something of a bubble has appeared to burst.\n\nSamsung, though, is still positive about AI demand.

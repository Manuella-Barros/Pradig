He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.\n\nThere were trails of blood on both sides of his body, and it appeared he had been struck in the head.\n\nPhoto GalleryIndigenous crime gets new focus\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim -- a Navajo man identified only as John Doe -- was \"on a collision course\" with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.\n\nA grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of second-degree murder in the Jan. 18 death, and prosecutors say more charges are likely, as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque. Investigators found wallets, cell phones and articles of clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people gathered around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.\n\nSpecial teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona Capitol to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned for May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was 21 when she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nIt was an emotional day in Albuquerque, where family members and advocates participated in a prayer walk. They chanted: \"What do we want? Answers! What do we want? Justice!\" There were tears and long embraces as they shared their stories and frustrations. They talked about feeling forgotten and the lack of resources in American Indian communities.\n\nGeraldine Toya of Jemez Pueblo marched with other family members to bring awareness to the death of her daughter Shawna Toya in 2021. She said she and her husband are artists who make pottery and never dreamed they would end up being investigators in an effort to determine what happened to their daughter.\n\n\"Our journey has been rough, but you know what, we're going to make this journey successful for all of our people that are here in this same thing that we're struggling through right now,\" she said, vowing to support other families through their heartbreak as they seek justice.\n\nAlex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program is starting to pay dividends.\n\n\"Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing the patterns that affect all of our communities,\" Uballez said. \"None of our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on communities -- across tribal communities, across states, across the nation, across international borders.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.\n\nHaving law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence. The other pieces of the puzzle are building relationships with Native American communities and making the justice system more accessible to the public, Neal said.\n\nPart of Neal's work includes reviewing old cases, time-consuming work that can involve tracking down witnesses and resubmitting evidence for testing.\n\n\"We're trying to flip that script a little bit and give those cases the time and attention they deserve,\" he said, adding that communicating with family members about the process is a critical component for the MMIP attorneys and coordinators.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department over the past year also has awarded $268 million in grants to tribal justice systems for handling child abuse cases, combating domestic and sexual violence and bolstering victim services.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse was dressed in red as she was sworn in Thursday during a ceremony in Yakima, Wash. The color is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double-digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\n\"This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my friends and my family,\" she said. \"I see this as a way to help make sure that our future generations, our young people don't experience these same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices, consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded innocent while standing shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was there, too, sitting with victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims. along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases \"to get him off the street\" and prevent more violence.\n\nBenjamin Toya, center, marches to bring awareness to his daughter's death, in 2021, as dozens of people participated in Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Day in Albuquerque, N.M., Sunday, May 5, 2024.

He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.\n\nThere were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared he had been struck in the head.\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim -- a Navajo man identified only as John Doe -- was \"on a collision course\" with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.\n\nA grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of second-degree murder in the Jan. 18 death, and prosecutors say more charges are likely as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque. Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people gathered around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.\n\nSpecial teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capitol to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned for May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was only 21 when she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nIt was an emotional day in Albuquerque, where family members and advocates participated in a prayer walk. They chanted: \"What do we want? Answers! What do we want? Justice!\" There were tears and long embraces as they shared their stories and frustrations. They talked about feeling forgotten and the lack of resources in Native communities.\n\nGeraldine Toya of Jemez Pueblo marched with other family members to bring awareness to the death of her daughter Shawna Toya in 2021. She said she and her husband are artists who make pottery and never dreamed they would end up being investigators in an effort to determine what happened to their daughter.\n\n\"Our journey has been rough, but you know what, we're going to make this journey successful for all of our people that are here in this same thing that we're struggling through right now,\" she said, vowing to support other families through their heartbreak as they seek justice.\n\nAlex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program is starting to pay dividends.\n\n\"Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing the patterns that affect all of our communities,\" Uballez said. \"None of our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on communities -- across tribal communities, across states, across the nation, across international borders.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.\n\nHaving law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence. The other pieces of the puzzle are building relationships with Native American communities and making the justice system more accessible to the public, Neal said.\n\nPart of Neal's work includes reviewing old cases: time-consuming work that can involve tracking down witnesses and resubmitting evidence for testing.\n\n\"We're trying to flip that script a little bit and give those cases the time and attention they deserve,\" he said, adding that communicating with family members about the process is a critical component for the MMIP attorneys and coordinators.\n\nThe DOJ over the past year also has awarded $268 million in grants to tribal justice systems for handling child abuse cases, combating domestic and sexual violence and bolstering victim services.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse was dressed in red as she was sworn in Thursday during a ceremony in Yakima, Washington. The color is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\n\"This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my friends and my family,\" she said. \"I see this as a way to help make sure that our future generations, our young people don't experience these same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices, consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty while standing shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was there, too, sitting with victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases \"to get him off the street\" and prevent more violence.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas

(AP) -- It was a frigid winter morning when authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in western New Mexico. He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.\n\nThere were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared he had been struck in the head.\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim -- a Navajo man identified only as John Doe -- was \"on a collision course\" with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.\n\nA grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of second-degree murder in the Jan. 18 death, and prosecutors say more charges are likely as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque. Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people plan to gather around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.\n\nSpecial teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capitol to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned on May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was only 21 when she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nAlex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program already is paying dividends.\n\n\"Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing the patterns that affect all of our communities,\" Uballez said. \"None of our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on communities -- across tribal communities, across states, across the nation, across international borders.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.\n\nHaving law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence.

The color is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\n\"This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my friends and my family,\" she said. \"I see this as a way to help make sure that our future generations, our young people don't experience these same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices, consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty while standing shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was there, too, sitting with victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases \"to get him off the street\" and prevent more violence.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The color is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\n\"This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my friends and my family,\" she said. \"I see this as a way to help make sure that our future generations, our young people don\u00b4t experience these same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices, consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty while standing shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was there, too, sitting with victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases \"to get him off the street\" and prevent more violence.\n\nIn this photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office, Eastern District of Washington, U.S. Attorney Vanessa Welder, left, administers the oath of office to Assistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse, right, during a ceremony Thursday, May 2, 2024, at the Yakama Nation Justice Center in Toppenish, Wash.

(AP) -- It was a frigid winter morning when authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in western New Mexico. He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.\n\nThere were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared he had been struck in the head.\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim -- a Navajo man identified only as John Doe -- was \"on a collision course\" with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.\n\nA grand jury has indicted a man from Zuni Pueblo on a charge of second-degree murder in the Jan. 18 death, and prosecutors say more charges are likely as he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup, Zuni and Albuquerque. Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people plan to gather around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.\n\nSpecial teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capitol to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned on May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was only 21 when she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nAlex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program already is paying dividends.\n\n\"Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing the patterns that affect all of our communities,\" Uballez said. \"None of our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on communities -- across tribal communities, across states, across the nation, across international borders.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHaving law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence.

(AP) It was a frigid winter morning when authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in western New Mexico. He was lying on his side with only one sock on, his clothes removed and his shoes thrown into the snow.\n\nThere were traces of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared that he had been hit in the head.\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, collecting security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles from Gallup, an economic center in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the nation Navajo and on the other by Zuni Pueblo.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cellphone records showed the victim, a Navajo man identified only as John Doe, who was on a collision course with the man who would ultimately be charged with killing him.\n\nA grand jury indicted a Zuni Pueblo man on second-degree murder charges that occurred Jan. 18, and prosecutors say more charges are likely because he is the prime suspect in a series of crimes targeting Native American men in Gallup. Zuni and Albuquerque. Investigators discovered several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men during a search of his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people gathered across the country Sunday to highlight the disturbing number of disappearances and murders in Indian Country, officials say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Defense is facing. Justice had aspired when creating its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Program. last summer.\n\nTask forces comprised of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators were assigned to focus on MMIP cases. Their goal: to improve communication and coordination among federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of closing the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capital to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla border in North Carolina, marches, symposia, art exhibits and candlelight vigils were planned for May 5, on the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was just 21 when she was killed. on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nIt was an emotional day in Albuquerque, where family members and advocates participated in a prayer walk. They chanted: What do we want? Answers! What do we want? Justice! There were tears and long hugs as they shared their stories and frustrations. They spoke about the feeling of forgetting and the lack of resources in indigenous communities.\n\nGeraldine Toya of Jemez Pueblo walked with other family members to raise awareness of the death of her daughter Shawna Toya in 2021. She said she and her husband are artists who make pottery and they don Would never have imagined that they would end up becoming investigators in an effort to figure out what was going on. happened to their daughter.\n\nOur journey has been difficult, but you know what, we are going to make this journey a success for all of our people who are here in this same thing that is struggling right now, she said, pledging to support other families through their grief as they seek justice.\n\nAlex Uballez, U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program is starting to bear fruit.\n\nProviding these bridges between these agencies is critical to seeing trends that affect all of our communities, Uballez said. None of the boundaries we have drawn prevent impacts to tribal communities, interstate, across the country, and across international borders.\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region covering New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and Nevada.\n\nHaving law enforcement and lawyers talking to each other can help prevent other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence. Other pieces of the puzzle include building relationships with Native American communities and making the justice system more accessible to the public, Neal said.\n\nPart of Neal's job involves reviewing old cases: tedious work that can involve tracking down witnesses and resubmitting evidence for testing.\n\nWe're trying to flip the script a little bit and give these cases the time and attention they deserve, he said, adding that communicating with family members about the process is an element essential for lawyers and MMIP coordinators.\n\nOver the past year, the DOJ also awarded $268 million in grants to tribal justice systems to address child abuse cases, combat domestic and sexual violence, and strengthen victim services.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse was dressed in red as she was sworn in Thursday at a ceremony in Yakima, Washington. This color stands for awareness of the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who are victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more cold cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and an attorney for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 U.S. attorneys and deputy coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\nIt's an issue that has affected not only my community but also my friends and family, she said. I see this as a way to help ensure that our future generations, our young people, don't face the same types of disparities and this same type of trauma.\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged that the federal government was moving slowly and credited tribal communities for raising their voices, showing up regularly to protest and pressuring politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it would take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty as he stood shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was also present, sitting with the victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's lawyer argued that no evidence has yet been presented linking his client to the alleged crimes outlined in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no release conditions would ensure the safety of the community, pointing to cellphone data and DNA evidence showing Tsethlikai preyed on homeless people or needing alcohol to satisfy sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody awaiting trial while authorities continue their investigation. Court documents list at least 10 other victims as well as five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few cases to get him off the streets and prevent more violence.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source":

(AP) -- It was a frigid winter morning when authorities found a Native American man dead on a remote gravel road in western New Mexico. He was lying on his side, with only one sock on, his clothes gone and his shoes tossed in the snow.\n\nThere were trails of blood on both sides of his body and it appeared he had been struck in the head.\n\nInvestigators retraced the man's steps, gathering security camera footage that showed him walking near a convenience store miles away in Gallup, an economic hub in an otherwise rural area bordered on one side by the Navajo Nation and Zuni Pueblo on the other.\n\nCourt records said the footage and cell phone records showed the victim -- a Navajo man identified only as John Doe -- was \"on a collision course\" with the man who would ultimately be accused of killing him.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Investigators found several wallets, cell phones and clothing belonging to other men when searching his vehicle and two residences.\n\nAs people plan to gather around the nation on Sunday to spotlight the troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country, authorities say the New Mexico case represents the kind of work the U.S. Department of Justice had aspired to when establishing its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons outreach program last summer.\n\nSpecial teams of assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators have been tasked with focusing on MMIP cases. Their goal: Improve communication and coordination across federal, tribal, state and local jurisdictions in hopes of bridging the gaps that have made solving violent crimes in Indian Country a generational challenge.\n\nSome of the new federal prosecutors were participating in MMIP Awareness Day events. From the Arizona state capitol to a cultural center in Albuquerque and the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina, marches, symposiums, art exhibitions and candlelight vigils were planned on May 5, which is the birthday of Hanna Harris, who was only 21 when she was killed on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana in 2013.\n\nAlex Uballez, the U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico, told The Associated Press on Friday that the outreach program already is paying dividends.\n\n\"Providing those bridges between those agencies is critical to seeing the patterns that affect all of our communities,\" Uballez said. \"None of our borders that we have drawn prevents the spillover of impacts on communities -- across tribal communities, across states, across the nation, across international borders.\"\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal oversees MMIP cases for a region spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Nevada.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHaving law enforcement agencies and attorneys talking to each other can help head off other crimes that are often precursors to deadly violence. The other pieces of the puzzle are building relationships with Native American communities and making the justice system more accessible to the public, Neal said.\n\nPart of Neal's work includes reviewing old cases: time-consuming work that can involve tracking down witnesses and resubmitting evidence for testing.\n\n\"We're trying to flip that script a little bit and give those cases the time and attention they deserve,\" he said, adding that communicating with family members about the process is a critical component for the MMIP attorneys and coordinators.\n\nThe DOJ over the past year also has awarded $268 million in grants to tribal justice systems for handling child abuse cases, combating domestic and sexual violence and bolstering victim services.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Bree Black Horse was dressed in red as she was sworn in Thursday during a ceremony in Yakima, Washington. The color is synonymous with raising awareness about the disproportionate number of Indigenous people who have been victims of violence.\n\nShe prosecutes MMIP cases in a five-state region across California and the Pacific Northwest to Montana. Her caseload is in the double digits, and she's working with advocacy groups to identify more unresolved cases and open lines of communication with law enforcement.\n\nAn enrolled member of the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma and a lawyer for more than a decade, Black Horse said having 10 assistant U.S. attorneys and coordinators focusing solely on MMIP cases is unprecedented.\n\n\"This is an issue that has touched not only my community but my friends and my family,\" she said. \"I see this as a way to help make sure that our future generations, our young people don't experience these same kinds of disparities and this same kind of trauma.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, Uballez acknowledged the federal government moves slowly and credited tribal communities with raising their voices, consistently showing up to protest and putting pressure on politicians to improve public safety in tribal communities.\n\nStill, he and Neal said it will take a paradigm shift to undo the public perception that nothing is being done.\n\nThe man charged in the New Mexico case, Labar Tsethlikai, appeared in court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty while standing shackled next to his public defender. A victim advocate from Uballez's office was there, too, sitting with victims' family members.\n\nTsethlikai's attorney argued that evidence had yet to be presented tying her client to the alleged crimes spelled out in court documents. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew McGinley argued that no conditions of release would keep the community safe, pointing to cell phone data and DNA evidence allegedly showing Tsethlikai had preyed on people who were homeless or in need of alcohol so he could satisfy his sexual desires.\n\nTsethlikai will remain in custody pending trial as authorities continue to investigate. Court documents list at least 10 other victims along with five newly identified potential victims. McGinley said prosecutors wanted to focus on a few of the cases \"to get him off the street\" and prevent more violence.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This Sunday, there will be a march in Riverton to honor the day and promote action to address a crisis that's close to home for many.\n\nAccording to data from Wyoming's MMIP task force, homicide rates for Native people are five times higher than they are for white people in the state. Law enforcement entered 176 cases of missing Indigenous peoples in Wyoming into the National Crime Information Center system last year, representing 110 individual people. Eleven of those cases remain unresolved.\n\nMay 5 is also known as Red Dress Day or Wear Red Day. This year's theme for the march in Riverton is \"We March for Them.\" It's hosted by local group MMIP Wind River.\n\nNicole Wagon is a Northern Arapaho MMIP advocate and helped organize the event, which started in 2019. She said it's important for the whole community - Riverton, Lander and the Wind River Reservation - to come together around the cause.\n\n\"We have to embrace the fact that all homicides are not on the reservation only. When I state that whatever happens on the Wind River bleeds into the cities, it's true. Whatever happens in the cities does bleed into the Wind River,\" she said.\n\nWagon said there's been some progress on addressing the MMIP crisis, like the recent implementation of the Ashanti Alert system, which sends out notifications about abducted, kidnapped or compromised adults. But she added there's more work to be done.\n\n\"[We're] trying to get into the pro and preventative side, to stop the violence, stop the sex trafficking, stop the murders, stop where people feel helpless in the midst of 'When do I file somebody missing?'\" she said. \"[We can] come together as a community to support one another and to address these issues of 'How do we come together to make it safe again?'\"\n\nMarch-goers will gather at the FCSD #25 administration parking lot at 121 North 5th Street starting at 10:30 a.m., then walk down Main Street to City Park at 11 a.m.\n\nTwo-Spirit Indigenous activist Charlene Sleeper, who is Crow, Southern Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Chippewa Cree, will share about her experiences founding MMIP Billings, which offers consulting and resources for education on MMIP cases in Montana.\n\nThere will also be drummers, dancers, the Redrum Motorcyle Club, representatives from Medicine Wheel Ride and other guest speakers. Wagon said those affected by the crisis are invited to share their stories at an open mic, which she recognizes is no small feat.\n\n\"Share their voice, this is what it's about. It is really traumatizing, so I hope that people have empathy and respect. It is opening up the wounds, but help is there and you're not alone,\" she said.\n\nStew, fry bread and berry gravy will be provided for all. Groups like the Doya Natsu Healing Center and the White Buffalo Recovery Center will have informational tables at the park. Everyone is welcome and participants are invited to wear red.", "source": {"uri": "wyomingpublicmedia.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wyoming Public Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverton,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riverton, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riverton, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_River_(Wyoming)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind River (Wyoming)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dress_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Dress Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arapaho", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arapaho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Information_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Crime Information Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples of the Americas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_River_Indian_Reservation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind River Indian Reservation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_reservation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian reservation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lander, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lander, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crow_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crow people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_and_Arapaho_Tribes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chippewa_Cree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chippewa Cree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frybread", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frybread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billings,_Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billings, Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Billings, Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Disability", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Disability", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3eb5464/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1438x809+0+84/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F6c%2F8400731b4960b5586d4de9b9546c%2F345426490-742908174001104-8275372933566327732-n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540184", "eventUri": "eng-9540184", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Garland, in recognition of National Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Awareness Day, spoke about the federal government's ongoing efforts and concerns for public safety in Indigenous communities.\n\n\"There is still so much more to do in the face of persistently high levels of violence that tribal communities have endured for generations, and that women and girls, particularly, have endured,\" Garland said in a YouTube video posted on May 3 by the U.S. Justice Department. \"... This day challenges all of us at the Justice Department to double down on our efforts, and to be true partners with tribal communities as we seek to end this crisis.\"\n\nPart of his statement was included in U.S. Attorney's Office district of North Dakota press release issued Friday, May 3.\n\nThe release outlines ways MMIP cases -- and other public safety concerns that affect the nation's Indigenous population -- have been addressed by the federal government, and where gaps still exist.\n\nIn March, the Departments of Justice and the Interior released a joint response to the Not Invisible Act Commission's recommendations on how to combat both the MMIP and human trafficking crises.\n\nGarland stated \"more must be done across the federal government to resolve this longstanding crisis\" and support the healing of Indigenous peoples from generational traumas endured throughout history.\n\nIn July of last year, the Justice Department announced the creation of a MMIP Regional Outreach Program, placing 10 attorneys and coordinators in five regions across the U.S., the release said. Their purpose is to aid in preventing and responding to MMIP cases.\n\nThe five regions are the Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, Great Lakes and Southeast.\n\nThe North Dakota district office has partnered with its regional MMIP coordinator, Assistant U.S. Attorney Troy Morley of the district of South Dakota, to plan additional outreach for the development of Tribal Community Response Plans, according to the release.\n\nThe district is also planning its third annual Savanna's Act meetings, which will take place in June on each of the state's four major reservations, the release said. Local, state, federal and tribal officials will be present to discuss partnership efforts that can be made in response to MMIP cases.\n\n\"As we continue to work with our partners to carry out Savanna's Act and address this crisis, we know that one missing person case is too many,\" said Mac Schneider, U.S. attorney for the district of North Dakota. \"Those who are missing from their communities and their families are top of mind on MMIP Awareness Day and every day as we work together to increase public safety in Indian country.\"\n\nPartnerships already enhanced by Savanna's Act meetings include the North Dakota district's Law Enforcement Coordinator assisting by requesting resources for missing persons searches. In 2023, 45 of the 46 cases the agency assisted with providing resources for were resolved, the release said.\n\nResearch suggests some public safety challenges -- such as substance abuse, drug trafficking, violence and human trafficking -- can influence the rates of Indigenous people who go missing, according to the release.\n\nAs fentanyl becomes a larger issue across the United States so, too, does it on reservations -- \"where drug-related overdose death rates for Native Americans exceeds the national rate,\" the release said.\n\nBecause drugs like fentanyl expose already vulnerable communities to greater harm, the release said, federal law enforcement considers combatting trafficking to be a top priority.\n\nWithin the last year, the DOJ awarded $268 million to help enhance tribal justice systems and strengthen law enforcement responses. Funding has gone toward improving how child abuse cases are handled, combating sexual and domestic violence, supporting tribal youth programs and strengthening victim services, the release said.\n\nFor more information about the DOJ's efforts to address MMIP cases, instructions on how to report a missing person and other resources, go to justice.gov/tribal/mmip .", "source": {"uri":

Gazan health authorities said 45 people were killed as a blaze tore through a camp for displaced people following the Sunday strike by Israel. But Washington does not believe that Israel\u2019s actions in Rafah amount to a full-scale operation that would breach Biden\u2019s \u201cred lines,\u201d National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. \u201cAs a result of this strike on Sunday I have no policy changes to speak to,\u201d Kirby told a White House briefing. \u201cIt just happened, the Israelis are going to investigate it.\u201d Kirby added however that \u201cthis is not something that we\u2019ve turned a blind eye to\u201d when asked \u201chow many charred corpses\u201d it would take for Biden to change course on the issue. Biden has previously said he would not support a major Israeli military offensive in Rafah, from which one million civilians have fled, and earlier this month paused a shipment of heavy bombs to Israel over concerns they could be used against the southern Gazan city. Witnesses told AFP that Israeli tanks were stationed in the center of Rafah on Tuesday, after intense fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants in recent weeks. But under repeated questioning Kirby insisted that the president was not \u201cmoving the stick\u201d on how to define a major military offensive against Rafah. \u201cWe have not seen them smash into Rafah,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have not seen them go in with large units, large numbers of troops, in columns and formations in some sort of coordinated maneuver against multiple targets on the ground.\u201d \u2013 No to ICC sanctions \u2013 The Pentagon had earlier said that it considers Israel\u2019s assault on Rafah as \u201climited in scope.\u201d Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh also said the administration was waiting for the Israeli military to conclude its investigation into Sunday\u2019s strike before commenting further. \u201cWe certainly take seriously what happened over the weekend. We\u2019ve all seen the images. They\u2019re absolutely horrific,\u201d Singh added. Earlier US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Israel\u2019s preliminary investigation suggested that the strike was carried out using \u201cthe smallest bomb in their arsenal.\u201d Israel has called the loss of life \u201ca tragic accident\u201d and its army said Tuesday its munitions alone could not have caused the deadly blaze, adding that it had targeted and killed two senior Hamas militants in the strike. The White House also said it did not support calls from Republicans in Congress for sanctions against the International Criminal Court after its prosecutor sought an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that sanctions against the ICC is the right approach here,\u201d Kirby said, although he added that the United States still did not believe the war crimes court had jurisdiction. Separately, the Pentagon said the US military has suspended aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip by sea after its temporary pier was damaged by bad weather.", "summary": "<img width=\"300\" height=\"168\" src=\"https://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/US-says-not-changing-Israeli-policy-despite-Rafah-strike.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" />WASHINGTON (AFP): US President Joe Biden has no plans to change his Israel policy following a deadly weekend strike on Gaza&#8217;s Rafah &#8212; but is not turning a &#8220;blind eye&#8221; to the plight of Palestinian civilians, the White House said Tuesday.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the social platform X. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBrian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "naharnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naharnet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida. Floridians prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida as residents prepared to weather more heavy rainfall today and Friday.\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early today that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!,\" the post said.\n\nNumerous roads remained flooded and impassable for vehicles. On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the social platform X. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches.\n\nBrian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through today. Some places could see another 6 inches of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\n___\n\nFrisaro reported from Fort Lauderdale.

(AP) -- A tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida as residents prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!,\" the post said.\n\nNumerous roads remained flooded and impassable for vehicles. On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the social platform X. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFrisaro reported from Fort Lauderdale.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\n\"Due to ongoing heavy rainfall, several roadways throughout the City of Fort Lauderdale, including major thoroughfares like Broward Boulevard and Federal Highway near downtown are experiencing high water levels,\" Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said on X.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Miami Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me. I want to leave this place in the next three months. This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFurther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters).

In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type":

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the social platform X. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\n\"Due to ongoing heavy rainfall, several roadways throughout the City of Fort Lauderdale, including major thoroughfares like Broward Boulevard and Federal Highway near downtown are experiencing high water levels,\" Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said on X.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Miami Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me. I want to leave this place in the next three months. This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFurther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters).

Later Wednesday, Florida Gov.

The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Freida Frisaro in Cooper City, Florida, contributed to this story.", "source":

Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Freida Frisaro in Cooper City, Florida, contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The annual rainy season has arrived with a wallop in much of Florida, where a disorganized disturbance of tropical weather from the Gulf of Mexico has caused street flooding and triggered tornado watches but so far has not caused major damage or injuries. (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nA tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida as residents prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,\" the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nNumerous roads were flooded and impassable for vehicles. On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Freida Frisaro in Cooper City, Florida, contributed to this story.", "source":

The annual rainy season has arrived with a wallop in much of Florida. Al Diaz/Miami Herald/AP hide caption\n\nA tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida as residents prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,\" the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nNumerous roads were flooded and impassable for vehicles. On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches.\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type":

His engine stalled.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has a problem with water.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nIn Miami\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is horrible. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pull my car around,\u00e2\u20ac he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBrian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are in trouble,\u00e2\u20ac McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov.

The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Freida Frisaro in Cooper City, Florida, contributed to this story.\n\nMore from this

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 a.m to 6 p.m. on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward county, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email.

Later Wednesday the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties - Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nDaniella Levine Cava, Miami-Dade county mayor, also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn nearby Hollywood, Mike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water\".\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said of the flooded streets.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about six inches (15cm) of rain fell Tuesday and seven inches (17cm) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about five inches (12cm).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some nine inches (23cm) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7am to 6pm on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another six inches (15cm) of rain.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimetres).\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, noted on X that some 9 inches (23 centimeters) had fallen on parts of South Florida from 7 am to 6 pm on Wednesday in addition to the rain that fell on Tuesday.\n\n\"We are in trouble,\" McNoldy wrote.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimetres) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85 per cent chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimetres) to 26 inches (66 centimetres). Many homes and businesses were flooded.

A tropical disturbance brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida the day before. Floridians prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

(AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Residents anticipate heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe Florida Panthers' Stanley Cup game against the Edmonton Oilers in Canada was postponed Wednesday due to severe rain and floods.\n\nA disorganised storm system from the Gulf of Mexico was crossing Florida in early June, when hurricane season began. The year is expected to be one of the busiest due to climate change-related storm strength increases. The National Hurricane Centre says the disturbance has not grown into a cyclone and has a slim possibility of becoming a tropical system when it leaves Florida and enters the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe hurricane centre reported Wednesday that \"heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days, regardless of development.\n\nCars couldn't cross many flooded roads. The Florida Highway Patrol said in an email that personnel were pumping the drainage system and that southbound Interstate 95 in Broward County was being redirected to avoid a flooded portion.\n\nFlorida EPA says the road can't be reopened without draining the water.\n\nThe Miami weather service issued further alarming warnings. The service posted on X that \"the flooding that poses a threat to life is still present.\" \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nThe mayors of Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale declared emergencies on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a state of emergency for Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, Lee, and Sarasota counties on the Atlantic and west coasts, respectively.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava declared a local emergency. Hollywood neighbour Mike Viesel told the Miami Herald that he was caught in deep floodwater on a low-lying street on Wednesday afternoon while driving home with his dog Humi.\n\nAs he halted, Viesel stated oncoming cars poured additional water into his car. His engine stopped. \"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nAlfredo Rodriguez moved into a building in Miami's Edgewater section a year ago, and the lobby had pools of water on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\" I can't drive on Florida's flooded highways, he said.\n\nMany Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport flights were cancelled or delayed. It took over three hours for the NHL's Florida Panthers to travel from Fort Lauderdale to Edmonton for Stanley Cup Final Games 3 and 4. The trip was expected to take almost six hours.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound north of West Palm Beach on Florida's Atlantic Coast, according to the Melbourne National Weather Service.\n\nMartin County Fire Rescue said that the gusts downed many banyan trees and damaged a shop. The road damage on Rich Jupiter Island prevented access, but no injuries were reported.\n\nFlorida has had a wet and windy week. The National Weather Service reported 6 inches of rain in Miami and 7 inches in Miami Beach on Tuesday. Hollywood gained about five inches.\n\nBryan McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, told X that South Florida received 9 inches of rain on Wednesday between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. on top of Tuesday's downpour.\n\nMcNoldy responded, \"We are in trouble.\" The Miami meteorological service has extended the flash flood watch through Thursday due to expected rain throughout the week. Rain may increase by six inches in certain areas.\n\nThe western half of the state, which has been droughting, received a lot of rain. Weather service: Sarasota Bradenton International Airport received almost 6.5 inches of rain on Tuesday. Such places have flash flooding advisories.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi in Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale, when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle.

In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_spencer@stripes.com", "name": "Terry Spencer",

The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi in Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale, when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but his dog \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nIn Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Miami Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me. I want to leave this place in the next three months. This is horrible.

On major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County, southbound traffic was being diverted around a flooded section and contractors were on their way to pump the drainage system, the Florida Highway Patrol said in an email. The interstate wouldn't reopen until after water is drained, the agency said.\n\nThe Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the service said on the X social media platform. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nMike Viesel was driving home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi in Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale, when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled.\n\n\"I'd walk out of my car,\" he told the Herald, but Humi \"has a problem with water.\"\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nFort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters).

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravellers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nMatthew Koziol, Mat\u00edas Ricci, Manuel Ricci and Ra\u00fal Fern\u00e1ndez travel by raft through a flooded street caused by heavy rain on North Bay Road in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., Wednesday, June 12, 2024.

He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nFrancisco Lopez stands near the flooded parking lot of his apartment building, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Hallandale, Fla.

(AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri":

Over a foot of rainfall was clocked in multiple areas.\n\nSeven million people remained under a flood watch Thursday across South Florida for what's forecast to be a third day of intense deluge.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the National Weather Service office in Miami warned on X.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, flood warnings were allowed to expire in parts of southern Florida, but residual flooding continues and several roads remain closed in hard hit areas. Heavy rain is forecast to pick up in the afternoon and evening hours\n\nThe National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall through Friday morning.\n\nThe heavy rain will create \"numerous areas of flash flooding,\" the weather service said. \"Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\"\n\nThe Miami metro area has practically zero tolerance for any more rain. Flash flood guidance reveals it'll take less than 0.25 inches of rain in just one hour to cause parts of the metro area to flood instantly.\n\nWednesday's downpour saw Gov. Ron DeSantis declare an emergency in Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, allowing for state aid. The cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood also issued emergency declarations.\n\nCars got stuck on inundated roads, water filled homes, locals were urged to stay in their residences, local airports saw hundreds of delays and cancellations, and part of the Interstate 95 in Broward County was closed to traffic for water to be drained.\n\nThe city of Aventura's police said that over 300 vehicles were towed off roadways and elderly individuals were rescued Wednesday from trapped vehicles.\n\nFort Lauderdale picked up 9.54 inches of rain in 24 hours, with Wednesday marking their wettest June day on record, and the third wettest calendar day on record.\n\nOverall, at least six weather stations from Miami to Fort Lauderdale picked up over 10 inches of rain -- the highest being 13.96 inches over Hialeah and 12.67 inches over the Hollywood/Hallandale Beach area. Most of the 10 to 12 inch rain totals came over the span of just five to six hours Wednesday.\n\nWhen combining Tuesday's rainfall, some locations across South Florida have picked up more than 20 inches of rain in just two days.\n\nThe more than a foot of rainfall that came down in just six hours over the Everglades reached the criteria for a 1-in-1,000-year event -- the second in just two days.\n\nOn Friday, the threat of excessive rainfall will decrease slightly over the southern tip of Florida, and a slight risk of excessive rainfall is in place for South Florida from Friday into Saturday morning.\n\nThrough Saturday morning, an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain will be possible including for the metro areas of Naples, Fort Myers, Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.",

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when it's coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches of rain have fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Va. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the [airport] employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early-June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches.\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Heavy rain is forecast to pick up in the afternoon and evening hours\n\nThe National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall through Friday morning.\n\nThe heavy rain will create \"numerous areas of flash flooding,\" the weather service said. \"Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\"\n\nThe Miami metro area has practically zero tolerance for any more rain. Flash flood guidance reveals it'll take less than 0.25 inches of rain in just one hour to cause parts of the metro area to flood instantly.\n\nYesterday's downpour saw Gov. Ron DeSantis declare an emergency in Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, allowing for state aid. The cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood also issued emergency declarations.\n\nCars got stuck on inundated roads, water filled homes, locals were urged to stay in their residences, local airports saw hundreds of delays and cancellations, and part of the Interstate 95 in Broward County was closed to traffic for water to be drained.\n\nThe City of Aventura's police said that over 300 vehicles were towed off roadways and elderly individuals were rescued Wednesday from trapped vehicles.\n\nFort Lauderdale picked up 9.54 inches of rain in 24 hours, with Wednesday marking their wettest June day on record, and the third wettest calendar day on record.\n\nOverall, at least six weather stations between Miami and Fort Lauderdale picked up over 10 inches of rain -- the highest being 13.96 inches over Hialeah and 12.67 inches over the Hollywood/Hallandale Beach area. Most of the 10 to 12 inch rain totals came over the span of just five to six hours Wednesday.\n\nWhen combining Tuesday's rainfall, some locations across south Florida have picked up more than 20 inches of rain in just two days.\n\nThe over foot of rainfall that came down in just six hours over the Everglades reached the criteria for a 1-in-1,000 year event -- the second to occur in just two days.\n\nOn Friday, the threat of excessive rainfall will decrease slightly over the southern tip of Florida, and a slight risk of excessive rainfall is in place for southern Florida from Friday into Saturday morning.\n\nThrough Saturday morning, an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain will be possible including for the metro areas of Naples, Fort Myers, Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.",

Heavy rain is forecast to pick up in the afternoon and evening hours\n\nThe National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center has issued a moderate risk of excessive rainfall through Friday morning.\n\nThe heavy rain will create \"numerous areas of flash flooding,\" the weather service said. \"Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\"\n\nThe Miami metro area has practically zero tolerance for any more rain. Flash flood guidance reveals it'll take less than 0.25 inches of rain in just one hour to cause parts of the metro area to flood instantly.\n\nYesterday's downpour saw Gov. Ron DeSantis declare an emergency in Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties, allowing for state aid. The cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood also issued emergency declarations.\n\nCars got stuck on inundated roads, water filled homes, locals were urged to stay in their residences, local airports saw hundreds of delays and cancellations, and part of the Interstate 95 in Broward County was closed to traffic for water to be drained.\n\nThe City of Aventura's police said that over 300 vehicles were towed off roadways and elderly individuals were rescued Wednesday from trapped vehicles.\n\nFort Lauderdale picked up 9.54 inches of rain in 24 hours, with Wednesday marking their wettest June day on record, and the third wettest calendar day on record.\n\nOverall, at least six weather stations between Miami and Fort Lauderdale picked up over 10 inches of rain -- the highest being 13.96 inches over Hialeah and 12.67 inches over the Hollywood/Hallandale Beach area. Most of the 10 to 12 inch rain totals came over the span of just five to six hours Wednesday.\n\nWhen combining Tuesday's rainfall, some locations across south Florida have picked up more than 20 inches of rain in just two days.\n\nThe over foot of rainfall that came down in just six hours over the Everglades reached the criteria for a 1-in-1,000 year event -- the second to occur in just two days.\n\nOn Friday, the threat of excessive rainfall will decrease slightly over the southern tip of Florida, and a slight risk of excessive rainfall is in place for southern Florida from Friday into Saturday morning.\n\nThrough Saturday morning, an additional 5 to 10 inches of rain will be possible including for the metro areas of Naples, Fort Myers, Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.",

(AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this story.\n\nMore from this

Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for South Florida Wednesday evening after 24 hours of inclement weather brought heavy rain and flooding to the region.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued for parts of Miami-Dade and Broward counties, where rainfall rates of several inches an hour submerged streets and snarled traffic.\n\nThe city of Sarasota was swamped Tuesday, with a record 3.93 inches of rain falling in just one hour. The rain forcing ground stops at both Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports, causing delays in excess of seven hours.\n\n\"We were looking at renting a vehicle to try and make it even to Orlando and maybe get on a flight but that isn't going to work either,\" frustrated traveler Chris Stephens told CBS Miami.\n\nIn a statement, the governor's office said that the severe weather and flash flooding prompted DeSantis to declare state of emergencies for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties.\n\nEarlier in the day, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis also declared states of emergency, along with the cities of Dania Beach and Sunny Isles Beach.\n\n\"Due to ongoing heavy rainfall, several roadways throughout the City of Fort Lauderdale, including major thoroughfares like Broward Boulevard and Federal Highway near downtown are experiencing high water levels,\" Trantalis said on X.\n\nIn Dania Beach, there were at least 40 rescues conducted by police and fire crews, CBS News Miami learned.\n\nPeriods of heavy rain continued to flood low-lying areas, with poor drainage throughout South Florida.\n\nIn Lee County on the Gulf Coast, emergency officials had to rescue at least one driver from floodwaters. Farther north, a possible tornado brought down trees and powerlines in Martin County.\n\nThe storms are part of a stalled system that's pummeled Florida, dumping a month's worth of rain in just 24 hours, with more rain forecast this week.\n\nA flood advisory remained in effect for Miami-Dade and Broward counties through 10 p.m. The National Weather Service also issued a rare flash flood emergency for portions of southern Broward County and northern Miami-Dade which expired at 8 p.m.\n\nA flash flood warning was also issued for Broward and Miami-Dade.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned residents to \"move to higher ground now! This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officials at MIA said at least 221 flights had been canceled and 165 had been delayed so far Tuesday, while at FLL there were at least 261 flight cancelations and 166 delays.\n\nThe Florida Panthers were on a three-hour delay at FLL before their flight took off to Edmonton, Canada, for Game 3 of their Stanley Cup Final series.\n\nSouth Florida officials said pump trucks were either in place or headed to flooded areas where they are needed.\n\nIn Broward County, part of I-95 had been closed due to flooding on the highway.\n\nPower outages were also reported across South Florida, and some traffic lights had been affected, making an already dire driving situation even worse for drivers.\n\nFlorida Power & Light said there were more than 8,900 customers without power in Miami-Dade County as of Tuesday evening, and another approximately 1,900 without power in Broward County.\n\nLaw enforcement was warning drivers in need of a tow to call tow truck companies first if possible, as opposed to immediately contacting police.\n\nThis wet, stormy weather pattern will hold in South Florida through the end of the work week, forecasters say, with the tropical moisture dissipating slightly by the weekend. That will leave the region a bit drier, but there will still be a chance for storms, but not nearly as widespread.\n\nOver the past 24 hours, Miami Beach saw nearly 7 inches of rain, Hallandale Beach saw 6 inches of rain, while Hollywood, North Miami and Coral Gables received just over 5 inches.\n\nThe 4 to 6 inches of rain that fell Tuesday squashed the rainfall deficit in Miami-Dade County, and put a good dent in Broward's deficit.\n\nHowever, forecasters say an additional 4 to 8 inches is possible over the next few days, and flooding risk will continue.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com",

Devastating downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and left dozens of drivers stranded Wednesday in a storm that some residents have said is unlike anything they have ever experienced before.\n\nThe storm turned several roads in south Florida into rivers and lakes, forcing locals to abandoned their cars and wade through the water. Interstate 95 reopened early this morning after the Florida Highway Patrol closed parts closed parts of the major artery on Wednesday after it became impassable for drivers. Governor Ron DeSantis has declared a state of emergency for five counties as residents prepare to weather more heavy rainfall today and tomorrow, which forecasters warn could trigger flash floods in central and south Florida.\n\nA tropical disturbance will continue to unleash torrential downpours across Florida today, bringing a rare flash flood emergency to much of the state. The disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season - which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity. The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center. 'Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,' the hurricane center said.\n\nForecasters predict between 18 and 24 inches of rain will fall across southwestern Florida throughout the course of the storm. Some radar suggests the region could see up to 30 inches of rainfall, which is typical of a severe slow-moving tropical storm or hurricane. AccuWeather Meteorologist Bernie Rayno warned that the storm will be 'like a wall of water coming at southern and central Florida into Thursday'. 'The steadiest and heaviest rain will fall on South and central Florida through Thursday, but more spotty downpours and thunderstorms will continue to pester the region into Saturday,' added AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Rene\u00e9 Duff.\n\nFlorida had been battling extreme heat and drought conditions prior to the arrival of Tuesday's tropical rainstorm. But as of Wednesday afternoon more than 11 inches of rain had already fallen across communities in the southwestern region of the state, with Fort Myers recording more than 5 inches. Forecasters warn that for much of central and south Florida, the rainfall over the next few days could approach or exceed the total amount of rain that fell in the first five months of the year. Several roadways were underwater Wednesday night after a tropical storm caused major flooding, flooding blocked roads and floated vehicles.\n\nDozens of drivers were forced to abandoned their vehicles along Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, located between Fort Lauderdale and Miami, as water kept rising. 'I got stuck with this car, if that car would move I would move too,' one driver told NBC Miami. 'I feel so bad, so terrible, this has never happened to me in my life.' Another added: 'I've never seen this in my life.' Mike Viesel was driving to his Hollywood home Wednesday afternoon with his dog Humi when he was caught in deep floodwater along a low-lying street, he told the Miami Herald.\n\nAs he slowed down and stopped, Viesel said other cars drove past him, sending even more water into his vehicle. His engine stalled. 'I'd walk out of my car,' he told the Herald, but his dog 'has a problem with water.' In Miami's Edgewater neighborhood, the lobby of the building that Alfredo Rodriguez moved into a year ago already had water puddles inside on Wednesday morning. He told the Herald the building has flooded five times since he moved in. 'This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,' he said of the flooded streets.\n\nNumerous roads were impassable for vehicles on Wednesday, including Interstate 95 in Broward County. Highway patrol was forced to divert southbound traffic around a flooded section of the interstate as contractors worked to pump the drainage system. The interstate, which officials have warned would remain closed until the water was drained, reopened early Thursday morning.\n\nDozens of flights were delayed or canceled at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Wednesday. The NHL's Florida Panthers were delayed more than three hours from departing Fort Lauderdale for their nearly six-hour flight to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup Final. The Miami weather service office issued increasingly dire warnings on Wednesday, as the storm system worsened. 'Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,' the service said on the X social media platform. 'Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.' Mayors in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Miami-Dade County declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nLater Wednesday, Gov. DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties - Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast. Farther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning. The winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road. More rain is forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through today.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well. Forecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85 per cent chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average , predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

(AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg, Florida, contributed to this story.", "source":

(Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nThe annual rainy season has arrived with a wallop in much of Florida, where a disorganized disturbance of tropical weather from the Gulf of Mexico has caused street flooding and triggered tornado watches but so far has not caused major damage or injuries.\n\nFlorida's rainy season roughly begins in June with the start of the six-month hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory. The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,\" the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nNumerous roads were flooded and impassable for vehicles, including a section of major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County. The Florida Highway Patrol said southbound traffic was being diverted around the flooded section.\n\n\"This closure will remain until further notice and water drains from the interstate. Contractors are enroute to pump the drainage system,\" FHP said in an email.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida, especially in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas.

The deluge battered southern Florida, blocking roads, stranding vehicles, forcing flight delays and cancellations at airports.\n\nThe disorganized storm system, moving across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico, coincided with the early June start of hurricane season. This year's hurricane season is expected to be one of the most active in recent history, according to Associated Press.\n\nAlthough the disturbance has not yet reached cyclone status, the National Hurricane Center indicated only a slight chance of it developing into a tropical system once it crosses Florida and moves into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe flooding made several roads impassable in Florida, including a section of Interstate 95 in Broward County, where southbound traffic was being diverted. Contractors were dispatched to pump the drainage system, while the Florida Highway Patrol confirmed that the interstate would remain closed until the water was drained.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Miami office issued increasingly urgent warnings. \"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing. Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground,\" it posted on X.\n\nIn response to the flooding, mayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared states of emergency in their cities. DeSantis extended it to include Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast, as well as Collier, Lee, and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also declared a local state of emergency.\n\nFort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis reported significant flooding in the city, including major thoroughfares like Broward Boulevard and Federal Highway near downtown.\n\nThe flooding also disrupted operations at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, causing numerous flight delays and cancellations. The NHL's Florida Panthers experienced a more than three-hour delay departing Fort Lauderdale for Edmonton for the Stanley Cup Final games.\n\nFurther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach Wednesday morning.\n\nForecasters have predicted more rain throughout the week, prompting the Miami weather service office to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday.\n\nSome areas could receive an additional 6 inches of rain. The western side of the state, which has been experiencing a prolonged drought, also saw significant rainfall, with nearly 6.5 inches recorded at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport on Tuesday. Flash flood warnings were in effect for these areas as well.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A tropical disturbance brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida the day before. Floridians prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday.\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A tropical disturbance that brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida delayed flights at two of the state's largest airports and left vehicles waterlogged and stalled in some of the region's lowest-lying streets.\n\n\"Looked like the beginning of a zombie movie,\" said Ted Rico, a tow truck driver who spent much of Wednesday night and Thursday morning helping to clear the streets of stalled vehicles. \"There's cars littered everywhere, on top of sidewalks, in the median, in the middle of the street, no lights on. Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse, and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kind of par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIn Hallandale Beach, Alex Demchemko, was walking his Russian spaniel Lex along the still-flooded sidewalks near the Airbnb where he's lived after arriving from Russia last month to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\n\"We didn't come out from our apartment, but we had to walk with our dog,\" Demchemko said. \"A lot of flashes, raining, a lot of floating cars and a lot of left cars without drivers, and there was a lot of water on the streets. It was kind of catastrophic.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, Daniela Urrieche, 26, was bailing water out of her SUV, which got stuck on a flooded street as she drove home from work on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"In the nine years that I've lived here, this has been the worst,\" she said. \"Even in a hurricane, streets were not as bad as it was in the past 24 hours.\"\n\nThe flooding wasn't limited to the streets. Charlea Johnson spent Wednesday night at her Hallendale Beach home barreling water into the sink and toilet.\n\n\"The water just started flooding in the back and flooding in the front,\" Johnson said.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and mayors in Fort Lauderdale , Hollywood and Miami-Dade County each declared a state of emergency.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, with some areas getting another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nAssociated Press writers Curt Anderson in St. Petersburg and Stephany Matat, in Hallandale Beach, contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri":

Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.Farther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.The winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.It's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida.

He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wesh.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

The downpour prompted urgent warnings of \"life-threatening floods\" as major travel arteries closed, including a section of I-95, and hundreds of flights across several major airports were delayed and canceled.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency to coordinate and mobilize recovery efforts; the mayors of Fort Lauderdale and Miami also made an emergency declarations. With many roads still under several feet of water, any more rain could be dangerous, especially for Collier, Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which includes Naples, Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the weather service's Miami office wrote on social media.\n\nOn Thursday, rainfall totals ranging from 4-8 inches with locally higher amounts of more than 10 inches are in the realm of possibility, the weather service said. However, the exact location of the heaviest rainfall remains uncertain. Rain was expected to start falling heavily in the late morning and continue into the afternoon.\n\nMeteorologists say the system will bring more rain on Friday and Saturday.\n\nRecord-breaking rainfall soaks South Florida\n\nThe blitzkrieg of rain started on Tuesday, drenching southwest Florida in a deluge that raised the heights of rivers and flooded the streets of Sarasota, Naples and Fort Myers.\n\nIn Sarasota, nearly 4 inches of rain fell in one hour, the most to fall in such a short time since records began in 1972, according to the weather service. In Siesta Key, just south of Sarasota, more than half a foot of rain was recorded. Videos showed residents across the region pushing cars out of floodwaters.\n\nDarryl Dillon, the general manager of Mattison's City Grill in downtown Sarasota, said water crept into the outdoor patio for the first time in a storm that wasn't a hurricane. \"Nobody was out,\" Dillon told the Herald-Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"I stepped out of my car into a foot-and-a-half of water.\"\n\nWhile Miami and other parts of southeastern Florida were hit by bands of rain on Tuesday, it wouldn't be until Wednesday that the region would see \"life-threatening\" floods.\n\nAccording to preliminary figures, 5-6.5 inches of rain fell per hour in some parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties on Wednesday. At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 6.77 inches of rain was recorded, dashing the record of 5.47 inches recorded in 1978, according to the weather service.\n\nThe rain forced officials to shut down I-95 in the southbound direction in Fort Lauderdale. After six hours, the interstate, which runs from Miami up the eastern United States to the Canadian border, was reopened.\n\nThe foul weather is associated with a tropical disturbance over the state, one that the National Hurricane Center is giving a 20% chance of development into a depression or tropical storm over the next seven days.\n\nNational weather radar", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com",

It's the second consecutive day the Miami area has faced down flooding issues. Storms dropped 2 to 5 inches of rain and flooded streets Tuesday.\n\nIn Hallandale Beach, where footage showed one man kayaking among cars as high waters flooded parts of the city, officials urged residents to shelter in place and avoid driving or walking through the water.\n\nHallandale Beach officials said a family lost their son during the storm, but were later reunited with the help of local police who were able to find the young boy.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties, writing the heavy rain and floods has affected the \"operational capability of critical infrastructure,\" including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.\n\nThe severe weather also forced school officials in Broward County to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018 to Friday.\n\nA month's worth of rain in one day\n\nFort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a local state of emergency, citing \"excessive rain\" and flooding. City officials said the heavy rainfall led to \"high water\" on roads across the city, adding emergency management staff were deploying high water vehicles and vacuum trucks in the area.\n\nThe city saw a preliminary rainfall total of roughly 9.53 inches Wednesday, making it Fort Lauderdale's eighth wettest day on record, according to data from the National Weather Service.\n\nThat preliminary rainfall total is also just shy of Fort Lauderdale's average June rainfall of 9.55 inches - meaning the area will likely see over a month's worth of rainfall by midnight.\n\nThe severe weather led to hundreds of flight cancellations and delays across two of the region's main airports. At least 320 flights in and out of Miami International Airport were canceled and there were more than 280 flights flights in and out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state.\n\nSeveral more inches of rain are expected through the rest of the work week from a broad and disorganized area of storms stuck over the state. By late week, the National Hurricane Center gives the storms a low chance of organizing into the first tropical depression of hurricane season as it moves off the Southeast coast.\n\nDouble-digit rainfall totals are likely in parts of Florida by Friday, but a few areas in southwest Florida could approach 20 inches. The southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park, is at the greatest risk for rainfall totaling 10 inches or more.\n\nBut bursts of intense rain outside of the highest risk areas could cause flash flooding, especially in urban or poor-drainage areas.\n\nFlood watches are in effect for more than 8 million people in South Florida Wednesday through Thursday night.\n\nThe flood risk will increase through the week as storms unload drenching rain over the same area day after day, causing rainfall totals to climb, soils to saturate and area waterways to swell.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain will be beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nHow a giant gyre of moisture leads to tropical trouble\n\nThe robust moisture fueling this week's storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters.\n\nThe gyre's broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors - including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water - align.\n\nThe gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US.\n\nDespite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida.\n\nWhat the gyre is doing, is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week.\n\n\"Just the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\" Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida, told CNN.\n\nJune, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida. Frequent surges of deep, tropical moisture and the direct impact of tropical systems send rainfall totals skyrocketing during this part of the year.\n\nCNN's Sharif Paget, Robert Shackelford, Taylor

And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nFrancisco Lopez stands near the flooded parking lot of his apartment building, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Hallandale, Fla. A tropical disturbance has brought a rare flash flood emergency to much of southern Florida. Floridians prepared to weather more heavy rainfall on Thursday and Friday. (AP Photo/Marta Lavandier)\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather\u00b4s lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded - and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise. The other is what forecasters call the \"central American gyre,\" a low-pressure area of storms spinning counterclockwise in the western Caribbean Sea that appears every spring.\n\n\"These two features essentially created a channel that funneled moisture from the Caribbean up and into Florida,\" DaSilva said. \"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode. We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation.\"\n\nFlorida differs from other places prone to flash flooding because it is flat and doesn't have dry riverbeds or gullies that suddenly become raging torrents capable of washing away entire buildings.\n\nIn Florida, the heavy rains can overwhelm drainage and pumping systems, leaving the water nowhere to go. So it can suddenly switch from a few inches to a couple feet of water in a roadway in a matter of minutes - enough to stall a car engine and make it float away.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a rare flash flood emergency, which forecasters define as conditions that are imminently life-threatening or likely to cause property damage. In this case, it was mostly about vehicles stuck on flooded roads. About half of flood deaths happen to people who can't escape their cars.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect in South Florida through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDrought conditions existed before these storms in many parts of Florida, especially the Gulf Coast from the Tampa Bay area south to Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nIt got so bad in Sarasota that officials declared a drought emergency and urged people to conserve water until the annual rainy season began - usually around the same time as the June 1 start of hurricane season, which lasts until Nov. 30.\n\nParts of Sarasota got pummeled with 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a single hour Tuesday, an event weather forecasters say happens only every 500 years. Significant rainfall happened in other sections of the county as well.\n\n\"This rainfall should eliminate most, if not all of the drought conditions across South Florida,\" DaSilva said.\n\nTwo women react as they see flooding on their street, Thursday, June 13, 2024, in North Miami, Fla.

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse, and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday.

He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kind of par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nIn Hallandale Beach, Alex Demchemko, was walking his Russian spaniel Lex along the still-flooded sidewalks near the Airbnb where he's lived after arriving from Russia last month to seek asylum in the U.S.\n\n\"We didn't come out from our apartment, but we had to walk with our dog,\" Demchemko said. \"A lot of flashes, raining, a lot of floating cars and a lot of left cars without drivers, and there was a lot of water on the streets. It was kind of catastrophic.\"\n\nOn Thursday morning, Daniela Urrieche, 26, was bailing water out of her SUV, which got stuck on a flooded street as she drove home from work on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"In the nine years that I've lived here, this has been the worst,\" she said. \"Even in a hurricane, streets were not as bad as it was in the past 24 hours.\"\n\nThe flooding wasn't limited to the streets. Charlea Johnson spent Wednesday night at her Hallendale Beach home barreling water into the sink and toilet.\n\n\"The water just started flooding in the back and flooding in the front,\" Johnson said.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and mayors in Fort Lauderdale , Hollywood and Miami-Dade County each declared a state of emergency.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, with some areas getting another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

Officials said around 20 inches had fallen on Thursday afternoon in Hallandale Beach, near Fort Lauderdale. Videos from the southernmost Broward County city showed cars submerged to the hood.\n\nSeven million people in South Florida were under flood watches or warnings on Thursday, with forecasters projecting the most severe weather for counties previously hit by earlier deluges in the last few days.\n\nA tropical disturbance triggered a rare flash flood emergency warning across the tip of the Florida peninsula Thursday. Parts of South Florida, some of which were hit hardest by heavy rains and flooding earlier in the week, were bracing for another 4 to 8 inches of rainfall through Friday, said NEXT Weather meteorologist Lissette Gonzalez on CBS News Miami.\n\nMeteorologists at the Weather Prediction Center had updated their risk profile for excessive rainfall in Florida's southernmost areas to \"high\" early in the morning, explaining in a bulletin that the upgrade accounted \"for significant impacts expected with the next round of heavy rainfall over extremely sensitive areas that include the urban corridor in Southeast FL through the I-75 corridor over Alligator Alley.\"\n\nNamed after the reptiles that also inhabit the land, Alligator Alley runs horizontally across the Florida peninsula from around Fort Lauderdale on the West Coast to Naples on the East Coast. Florida wildlife officials have said that alligators and other wildlife could become more visible in flooded neighborhoods after a hurricane or tropical storm. It was not immediately clear whether current flooding would bring them out in the same way.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for multiple southern counties on Wednesday, while Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis individually issued emergency declarations for their jurisdictions in response to torrential rain and flooding, which caused cars to stall and grounded flights at two major airports.\n\nThose declarations trigger a set of emergency management protocols that allow authorities, either at the local or state level, or both, to access funds and other resources to respond to the weather. With the declaration in Miami, the city also set up distribution sites for sandbags, for residents to place outside the doors and windows of their homes to block out water, and opened nine public parking garages for people in flood-prone areas to leave their cars.\n\nAnother state of emergency was declared for the cities of Dania Beach and Sunny Isles Beach, as police and fire crews said they had conducted at least 40 rescues in Dania Beach in the midst of Wednesday's storms, CBS News Miami reported. Photos and video out of Dania Beach showed streets completely flooded, with water levels in some instances as high as a car tire.\n\nMany of those cities and counties braced for ongoing storms throughout Thursday, and a flood warning was active for Miami-Dade and Broward Counties until 4 a.m. ET on Friday morning.\n\nStorms have already dumped massive amounts of rain on much of southern Florida, with the latest precipitation reports suggesting as much as 20 inches fell in parts of Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. These totals were just shy of the record rainfall total recorded in the state over the last three days, which surpassed two feet of rain in the Everglades. Along the Gulf Coast, reports show at least 6 or 7 inches fell in several counties this week, and as much as 10 or 11 inches fell in several of them.\n\nWednesday's rainfall set new records in a handful of places, including some as far north as Fort Myers and the Winter Haven Regional Airport, the latter of which is about halfway between Tampa Bay and Orlando, according to the weather service. In Fort Myers, the city's latest rainfall of 3.86 inches surpassed its 2008 record-high of 2.14 inches. Precipitation records for Fort Myers date back more than a century.\n\nNew rainfall totals in and around Fort Myers could potentially surpass that record, as forecasters said 2 to 4 inches of rain had already fallen in the area early Thursday afternoon, and between 1 and 2 more inches was still expected.\n\nAnother heap of precipitation, potentially as much as 6 to 10 inches, could fall on parts of southwestern Florida throughout the rest of the week, they added, and the Weather Prediction Center noted that even higher amounts could potentially accumulate in isolated areas along the coast and extend inland to the interior part of the peninsula. The southwestern flood watch was set to expire at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday evening.\n\nA flood watch was in place for communities along nearly a 100-mile stretch of Florida's Gulf Coast, running from Tampa Bay through Fort Myers and extending inland for roughly the same distance at certain points in the watch area east of Sarasota. Meteorologists said that parts of coastal Sarasota County, which sits just below Tampa Bay, felt the brunt of the Gulf Coast weather on Wednesday, with 6 to 10 inches of rain recorded in various spots. One rainfall report showed almost 11.4 inches at a location in Sarasota.\n\nDespite the significant rainfall that already hit western Florida and the additional totals expected, forecasters said widespread flooding probably would not materialize, since precipitation would be coming in spurts and the breaks in between allowing water to drain. The primary concern was localized flooding and, potentially, flooding in urban areas. \"Heavy rainfall is forecast now through the weekend. At times, this could lead to mainly minor nuisance flooding in low-lying and poor drainage areas,\" NWS Tampa Bay said Tuesday in a social media post.\n\nThe agency advised drivers in the area to avoid flooded roads -- according to National Weather Service data, almost half of all flood-related deaths in the United States each year involve vehicles.\n\nAlthough the Florida counties farthest south on the peninsula were expected to see the most damaging rainfall Thursday and Friday, meteorologists also warned that the proximity of certain places nearer the Gulf Coast could still face substantial threats of more heavy rain and flooding, especially in areas where the ground is already saturated from earlier storms. They said their biggest concerns for southwestern Florida could come to fruition at some point Thursday afternoon when higher overall temperatures would likely destabilize the weather systems overhead and prompt a batter of showers and thunderstorms.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,\" the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida, especially in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. In Miami about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale, got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another half-foot (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall.

This will only exacerbate the ongoing flash flooding.\"\n\nThe heavy rainfall had been forecast early in the week, but the drubbing that first hit the southwest coast on Tuesday and then the tri-county area of Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade on Wednesday was record-breaking.\n\nAs of 4:30 p.m., 6.77 inches of rain was recorded at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, dashing the record of 5.47 inches recorded in 1978. Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach recorded 2.38 inches of rain, which fell far short of the 1901 record of 9.71 inches. About 2.25 inches of rain was measured at Miami International Airport on Wednesday, which is also far from the record 8.25 inches also measured in 1901.\n\n\"The tropical spigot pouring into South Florida has unleashed some of the soupiest air measured for our area in June, historically South Florida's rainiest month,\" said Michael Lowry, a meteorologist with South Florida ABC affiliate Channel 10 in his Eye on the Tropics column. \"With such a juiced atmosphere overhead, otherwise innocuous disturbances moving along in the atmosphere can bring lots of rain in little time.\"\n\nEarly-season tropical cyclones find a fertile nursery in the rich waters of the Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean Sea where stalled cool fronts can goad them to maturity in June and July.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center noted two areas to watch this week in the Gulf of Mexico with one, dubbed Invest 90-L, dumping days of flooding rainfall on Florida as it makes its way to the Atlantic Ocean and the other looking to find purchase in the Bay of Campeche.\n\nBoth areas had low chances of development as of Wednesday evening. If either were to form, they would be awarded the inaugural names on the 2024 hurricane list of Alberto and Beryl.\n\nThe NHC gave 90-L, a disorderly mish-mash of showers and thunderstorms, a 20% chance of development over the next seven days. But that mattered little to areas such as Sarasota where 11 inches of rain fell through early Wednesday, or to drivers on I-95, which was shut down Wednesday afternoon in Broward County because of flooding.\n\nFHP Lt. Indiana Miranda said at about 3 p.m. that traffic was being diverted at Oakland Park Boulevard and that a contractor was working to pump water off the roadway.\n\n\"We have one vehicle flooding in the area,\" Miranda said in an email. \"This closure will remain until further notice and water drains from the Interstate.\"\n\nClimatologically, homegrown tropical systems in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico and southwestern Atlantic are more common in the early days of the hurricane season ahead of the main-event months of August, September and October when waves rolling off Africa can swell to Goliaths in their trek west.\n\n\"This early in the season there is usually too much Saharan dust and too much shear in the Atlantic for those storms to form so it's rare to see something there this early on,\" said AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva about the region between Africa and the Caribbean. \"This time of year, you look closer to home.\"\n\nSaharan dust, made up of sand and mineral particles swept up from 3.5 million square miles of desert, spoils tropical development by stealing moisture from the air needed for storms to form.\n\nBut in the Gulf of Mexico, an ample feed of gooey air is usually available. That moisture, combined with a stalled boundary over north Florida where winds converged and pressure lowered, gave Invest 90-L life.\n\nMost areas of Palm Beach County got only 2 to 4 inches Tuesday but experienced prolonged showers Wednesday with some areas forecast to get more than 5 inches. Thunderstorms were strong enough to trigger a tornado warning for Wellington, Loxahatchee Groves, Palm Beach Gardens and Royal Palm Beach. And a flood watch was extended through 8 p.m. Friday.\n\nHurricane season 2024: More than 1 million new Florida residents may not understand storm prep\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service in Miami said \"life threatening\" flooding was occurring in Broward and Miami-Dade counties.\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport had massive cancellations, delays and flight diversions Wednesday because of the rain. It occurred a little over a year after major flooding shut down the airport and closed schools in and around Fort Lauderdale. During that April 12, 2023 drenching, the area saw about 26 inches of rain in a 24-hour period.\n\nOn Wednesday, airport officials warned on social media that flooding at entrances and exits was slowing traffic.\n\nThe tropical moisture will remain \"entrenched\" over South Florida through the remainder of the week with conditions favorable for flooding and flash flooding, especially in poorly draining urban areas.\n\nThe average first-named storm of the hurricane season doesn't occur until June 20.\n\nAll forecasts point to trouble: Forecasts all point to a busy season with La Ni\u00f1a and warm ocean temps\n\nWeather.com senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman said he's more bullish about something forming next week in the area in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico highlighted by the NHC on Wednesday.\n\nIt's possible if something forms it would be a piece of the Central American Gyre, which is responsible for several past tropical cyclones including Tropical Storm Cristobal in 2020, Hurricane Michael in 2018 and Hurricane Ida in 2009.\n\nErdman is already looking to the main development region.\n\n\"We are seeing pretty beefy-looking tropical waves out there already, and that is an ominous sign for a more active season,\" he said. \"Once the wind shear in that area relaxes and the Saharan air pushes away, the door is open.\"", "source": {"uri":

More than 8 million people are under flood alerts Thursday, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples. Another 4 to 8 inches of widespread rain is expected through Friday, but it's possible some spots record nearly a foot of rain.\n\nSix to more than 20 inches of rain has deluged South Florida since Tuesday morning, prompting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to declare a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nOngoing flooding resulting from past rainfall is one of the main reasons the flood risk is so high Thursday.\n\nFloodwaters haven't had time to fully recede and some communities in and north of the Miami metro remained underwater Thursday morning, areal imagery showed.\n\nThat was the case in Hallandale Beach - located just north of Miami - where nearly 20 inches of rain had fallen, and some mobile home parks were still underwater, said Broward County Sheriff's Office Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Michael Kane.\n\nSevere flooding there on Wednesday submerged cars up to their windshields, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety. Others had to be rescued.\n\n\"We had to use our boats to rescue people standing on top of the roofs of cars,\" Kane told CNN. Kane's office received 175 calls for help in Hallandale Beach alone.\n\nResident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her.\n\n\"If I was to open my car door, I would've just had a ton of water rushing in. I would've been out of luck big time,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nAfter hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said.\n\nSeveral local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said.\n\nFort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday.\n\nMiami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek.\n\nIn Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018.\n\nMany South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday.\n\nAnna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we're ready to go,\" Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nSignificant flood risk Thursday\n\nConsiderable flooding is likely across the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday and Friday as multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean drench the area.\n\nJust a quarter inch of rain could trigger flash flooding in extremely soaked areas, the Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday morning. Several inches of rainfall are likely to fall once storms develop Thursday afternoon, almost guaranteeing flash flooding.\n\nFriday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday.\n\nWet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nCNN's Sara Smart and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The emergency was in effect until 8:00 pm.\n\nCities under the emergency advisory were: Miami Gardens, North Miami Beach, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar and Dania Beach. Other urban city centers in both counties were forecast to see the greatest threat of flash flooding.\n\nForecasters said they've received \"nonstop\" reports of flash flooding. At one point, the NWS had six flash flood warnings in effect throughout the region.\n\nResidents were told not to drive in the emergency area and to seek higher ground until flood waters receded.\n\nSo far this week, parts of South Florida have seen up to at least 10 inches of rain.\n\nWhat is a flash flood emergency?\n\nA flash flood emergency is the most severe weather category for flooding. An emergency is only issued in exceedingly rare situations when extremely heavy rain is leading to a severe threat to life and catastrophic damage, the weather service said.\n\nLuke Culver, a meteorologist at NWS Miami, said the emergency \"is really for extremely rare situations where there are dangers to life and property.\"\n\n\"When we go to an emergency, we have people getting rescued from vehicles and particularly dangerous and life-threatening situations,\" he said.\n\nJohn Morales, a consulting meteorologist, said on X that the first flash flood emergency issued by National Weather Service Miami was for a record-breaking rainstorm that the Fort Lauderdale area in April 2023.\n\nAt the time, 31 inches of rain more than three days and 26 inches in one day transformed the Fort Lauderdale airport into a waterway.\n\nNorth of the airport, in the Edgewood area that had just received bigger pipes as part of a project to better deal with flooding, water levels rose to near waist-deep levels, pushing into homes.\n\n'We're prepared for the worst'\n\nThe Broward Sheriff's Office has been \"inundated\" with non-emergency calls regarding the inclement weather, as some reporting disabled cars, Sheriff Gregory Tony said on X.\n\nHe continued to urge residents to only use 911 for \"true emergencies,\" such as rescues. As of Wednesday night, the Broward Sheriff Fire Rescue had already completed more than a dozen of them.\n\nBattalion Chief Michael B. Kane told the Miami Herald that calls for rescues from flood waters began pouring in around 11:30 a.m. By the early evening, about 50 people had been saved from flooded cars.\n\nNo injuries or structural damage have been reported.\n\n\"I think we hit the peak at about 2 p.m., but that remains to be seen,\" Kane said. \"We've been able to keep up with the high volume of requests for victim removals from the high water.\"\n\nKane noted authorities also have been called for downed power lines and sparking outlets inside homes and businesses. He felt confident that residents and first responders alike were more prepared for this flood than they were last April when Fort Lauderdale saw a record-breaking amount of rain.\n\n\"I think we learned a lot of lessons last April,\" he said. \"We're prepared for the worst and preparing for the best, as they say.\"\n\nSouth Florida swamped with weather warnings\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a series of severe weather watches and warnings Wednesday that will stay in effect into the night.\n\nFour flash flood warnings were in effect until 8 p.m. for different areas of Miami-Dade and Broward. A warning indicates flash flooding is happening or will happen soon.\n\nCities in central and southern Broward, as well as northern Miami-Dade, were under warnings. The areas include Miami, Hialeah, Miami Beach, Coral Gables, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Davie and Pompano Beach.\n\nForecasters reported several inches of rain in the aforementioned areas have already fallen, with more coming. North Miami-Dade cities received between 3 to 7 inches of rainfall, with an additional 2 to 6 inches possible.\n\nA severe thunderstorm warning was also in effect for southern Miami-Dade until 6:30 p.m. The storm was moving east at 20 mph with 60 mph wind gusts. Forecasters said damage to roofs, siding and trees should be expected.\n\nCities listed in the warning: Homestead, Florida City, Goulds, Kendall and Richmond Heights.\n\nA general flood watch will remain in effect for Miami-Dade, Broward, and Monroe Counties through Friday evening. A watch means weather conditions are favorable for flash flooding, and plans should be made just in case.\n\nMiami-Dade, Broward combat dangerous flooding\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday night declared a state of emergency for Broward and Miami-Dade as about 10 to 15 inches of rainfall closed major interstates, roadways, airports and schools, according to the order.\n\nMiami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nIn an earlier statement, she assured county workers were hard at work Wednesday protecting \"critical infrastructure\" as the region bears the brunt of excessive rainfall and subsequent flooding.\n\n\"Miami-Dade County staff has been working proactively to prepare our community since before the rain started, and we are working to protect our residents and businesses,\" she said. \"We ask residents and visitors to stay safe, stay inside, avoid flooded areas and remain vigilant for possible hazards.\"\n\nThe Water and Sewer Department installed temporary dams around pump stations in vulnerable areas, drained the wastewater system and prepared vacuum trucks.\n\nSimultaneously, the county's Transportation and Public Works employees inspected over a dozen stormwater pumps and removed debris.\n\nThe Cities of Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood issued a state of emergency to better coordinate resources and ensure the safety of their residents. Community centers and other government buildings were closed.\n\n(Miami Herald reporter David J. Neal contributed to this report.)\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald. Visit miamiherald.com.

The disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n''Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,'' the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida, especially in the Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas. In Miami about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood, just south of Fort Lauderdale, got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another half-foot (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. In Sarasota, nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nThe deluge comes amid forecasts of an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes.

The downpour prompted urgent warnings of \"life-threatening floods\" as major travel arteries closed, including a section of I-95, and hundreds of flights across several major airports were delayed and canceled.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency to coordinate and mobilize recovery efforts; the mayors of Fort Lauderdale and Miami also made an emergency declarations. With many roads still under several feet of water, any more rain could be dangerous, especially for Collier, Miami-Dade and Broward counties, which includes Naples, Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the weather service's Miami office wrote on social media.\n\nOn Thursday, rainfall totals ranging from 4-8 inches with locally higher amounts of more than 10 inches are in the realm of possibility, the weather service said. However, the exact location of the heaviest rainfall remains uncertain. Rain was expected to start falling heavily in the late morning and continue into the afternoon.\n\nMeteorologists say the system will bring more rain on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe blitzkrieg of rain started on Tuesday, drenching southwest Florida in a deluge that raised the heights of rivers and flooded the streets of Sarasota, Naples and Fort Myers.\n\nIn Sarasota, nearly 4 inches of rain fell in one hour, the most to fall in such a short time since records began in 1972, according to the weather service. In Siesta Key, just south of Sarasota, more than half a foot of rain was recorded. Videos showed residents across the region pushing cars out of floodwaters.\n\nDarryl Dillon, the general manager of Mattison's City Grill in downtown Sarasota, said water crept into the outdoor patio for the first time in a storm that wasn't a hurricane. \"Nobody was out,\" Dillon told the Herald-Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"I stepped out of my car into a foot-and-a-half of water.\"\n\nWhile Miami and other parts of southeastern Florida were hit by bands of rain on Tuesday, it wouldn't be until Wednesday that the region would see \"life-threatening\" floods.\n\nAccording to preliminary figures, 5-6.5 inches of rain fell per hour in some parts of Broward and Miami-Dade counties on Wednesday. At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, 6.77 inches of rain was recorded, dashing the record of 5.47 inches recorded in 1978, according to the weather service.\n\nThe rain forced officials to shut down I-95 in the southbound direction in Fort Lauderdale. After six hours, the interstate, which runs from Miami up the eastern United States to the Canadian border, was reopened.\n\nThe foul weather is associated with a tropical disturbance over the state, one that the National Hurricane Center is giving a 20% chance of development into a depression or tropical storm over the next seven days.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice, USA TODAY; Melissa

I would've been out of luck big time,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nAfter hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said.\n\nSeveral local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said.\n\nFort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday.\n\nMiami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek.\n\nIn Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018.\n\nMany South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday.\n\nAnna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we're ready to go,\" Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nSignificant flood risk Thursday\n\nConsiderable flooding is likely across the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday and Friday as multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean drench the area.\n\nJust a quarter inch of rain could trigger flash flooding in extremely soaked areas, the Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday morning. Several inches of rainfall are likely to fall once storms develop Thursday afternoon, almost guaranteeing flash flooding.\n\nA level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday in South Florida, including the greater Miami area, where 10 to 20 inches of rain have fallen since Tuesday.\n\nFriday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday.\n\nWet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.", "source":

Just craziness, you know. Abandoned cars everywhere.\"\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nRico, of One Master Trucking Corp., was born and raised in Miami and said he was ready for the emergency.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You know when its coming,\" he said. \"Every year it's just getting worse and for some reason people just keep going through the puddles.\"\n\nTravelers across the area were trying to adjust their plans on Thursday morning. More than 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain has fallen in some areas of South Florida since Tuesday, with more predicted over the next few days.\n\nTicket and security lines snaked around a domestic concourse at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport just before noon Thursday. The travel boards showed about half of that terminal's flights had been canceled or postponed.\n\nBill Carlisle, a Navy petty officer first class, had spent his morning trying to catch a flight back to Norfolk, Virginia. He had arrived at Miami International Airport at about 6:30 a.m., but 90 minutes later he was still in line and realized he couldn't get his bags checked and through security in time to catch his flight.\n\n\"It was a zoo,\" said Carlisle, a public affairs specialist. He was speaking for himself, not the Navy. \"Nothing against the (airport) employees -- there is only so much they can do.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo he used his phone to book an afternoon flight out of Fort Lauderdale. He took a shuttle the 20 miles north, only to find that flight had been canceled. He was now heading back to Miami for a 9 p.m. flight, hoping it wouldn't get canceled by the heavy rains expected later in the day. He was resigned, not angry.\n\n\"Just a long day sitting in airports,\" Carlisle said. \"This is kinda par for the course for government travel.\"\n\nWednesday's downpours and subsequent flooding blocked roads, floated vehicles and even delayed the Florida Panthers on their way to Stanley Cup games in Canada against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nThe disorganized storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the early June start of hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory amid concerns that climate change is increasing storm intensity.\n\nThe disturbance has not reached cyclone status and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it moves into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami noted in a post on the social media platform X early Thursday that a band of heavy rainfall was expected to fall over the region for a third day in a row.\n\n\"Even a small duration of heavy rainfall could lead to more flash flooding!\" the post said.\n\nMayors in Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood declared a state of emergency for their cities on Wednesday afternoon. Later Wednesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also issued a local state of emergency.\n\nFarther north, the National Weather Service in Melbourne confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit Hobe Sound on Florida's Atlantic Coast north of West Palm Beach on Wednesday morning.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe winds knocked down multiple banyan trees and caused some damage to a store, Martin County Fire Rescue officials said. No injuries were reported, but access to wealthy Jupiter Island was cut off by debris on the road.\n\nIt's already been a wet and blustery week in Florida. In Miami, about 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday and 7 inches (17 centimeters) fell in Miami Beach, according to the National Weather Service. Hollywood got about 5 inches (12 centimeters).\n\nMore rain was forecast for the rest of the week, leading the weather service office in Miami to extend a flash flood watch through Thursday. Some places could see another 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain.\n\nThe western side of the state, much of which has been in a prolonged drought, also got some major rainfall. Nearly 6.5 inches (16.5 centimeters) of rain fell Tuesday at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, the weather service says, and flash flood warnings were in effect in those areas as well.\n\nForecasts predict an unusually busy hurricane season.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85% chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average, predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press sports writer Stephen Whyno in Edmonton, Canada, and Curt Anderson in St.

The annual rainy season has arrived with a wallop in much of Florida, where a disorganized disturbance of tropical weather from the Gulf of Mexico has caused street flooding and triggered tornado watches but so far has not caused major damage or injuries. (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nA series of storms flowing from the Gulf of Mexico swamped South Florida with flash floods that stalled cars, forced the cancellation of dozens of flights and generally made life miserable for tens of thousands of people.\n\nFlat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days when so-called king tides surge in coastal areas. And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise. The other is what forecasters call the \"central American gyre,\" a low-pressure area of storms spinning counterclockwise in the western Caribbean Sea that appears every spring.\n\n\"These two features essentially created a channel that funneled moisture from the Caribbean up and into Florida,\" DaSilva said. \"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode. We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation.\"\n\nFlorida differs from other places prone to flash flooding because it is flat and doesn't have dry riverbeds or gullies that suddenly become raging torrents capable of washing away entire buildings.\n\nIn Florida, the heavy rains can overwhelm drainage and pumping systems, leaving the water nowhere to go. So it can suddenly switch from a few inches to a couple feet of water in a roadway in a matter of minutes -- enough to stall a car engine and make it float away.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a rare flash flood emergency, which forecasters define as conditions that are imminently life-threatening or likely to cause property damage. In this case, it was mostly about vehicles stuck on flooded roads. About half of flood deaths happen to people who can't escape their cars.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect in South Florida through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDrought conditions existed before these storms in many parts of Florida, especially the Gulf Coast from the Tampa Bay area south to Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nIt got so bad in Sarasota that officials declared a drought emergency and urged people to conserve water until the annual rainy season began -- usually around the same time as the June 1 start of hurricane season, which lasts until Nov. 30.\n\nParts of Sarasota got pummeled with 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a single hour Tuesday, an event weather forecasters say happens only every 500 years. Significant rainfall happened in other sections of the county as well.\n\n\"This rainfall should eliminate most, if not all of the drought conditions across South Florida,\" DaSilva said.", "source":

The threat still isn't over - Boston News, Weather, Sports | WHDH 7News", "body": "(CNN) -- Heavy rainfall will swamp South Florida for a third day in a row on Thursday, threatening more destructive flooding after Wednesday's storms transformed roads into canals and caused water to seep into homes.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties after dangerous flooding immobilized the operations of critical infrastructure on Wednesday, including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.\n\nSix to more than 20 inches of rain has deluged South Florida since Tuesday morning. While the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.\n\nMore than 8 million people are under flood alerts Thursday, including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples. Another 4 to 8 inches of widespread rain is expected Friday, but it's possible some spots record nearly a foot of rain.\n\nSevere flooding in Hallandale Beach - located just north of Miami - submerged cars up to their windshields in some places, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety.\n\nA family lost their young son during the storm Wednesday, but were later reunited with the help of police who found the child, Hallandale Beach officials said.\n\nResident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her.\n\n\"If I was to open my car door, I would've just had a ton of water rushing in. I would've been out of luck big time,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nAfter hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said.\n\nSeveral local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Florida Department of Highway Safety said.\n\nFort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received its entire average June rainfall of around 9.5 inches in just 24 hours Wednesday.\n\nMiami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are expected to continue through the end of the workweek.\n\nIn Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018.\n\nMany South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday.\n\nAnna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we're ready to go,\" Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nSignificant flood risk Thursday\n\nConsiderable flooding is likely across the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday and Friday as multiple rounds of torrential downpours fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean drench the area.\n\nJust a quarter inch of rain could trigger flash flooding in extremely soaked areas, the Weather Prediction Center warned Thursday morning. Several inches of rainfall are likely to fall once storms develop Thursday afternoon, almost guaranteeing flash flooding.\n\nA level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place Thursday in South Florida, including the greater Miami area, where 10 to 20 inches of rain have fallen since Tuesday.\n\nFriday will also be another drenching day for South Florida, even as the robust tropical moisture fueling the soaking storms slowly starts to shift out of the area. All told, multiple locations could end up with more than two feet of rain Tuesday through Friday.\n\nWet weather is likely to continue over the weekend, just not to the severity of the past several days. But even the light-to-moderate rainfall rates of typical June showers and thunderstorms could cause additional flooding issues and prevent ongoing flooding from receding.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain is beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Cars waded through deep floodwaters in rush hour traffic on major roadways Wednesday night in Miami, as downpours fell even harder after two days of nearly nonstop rain.\n\nA dire flash flood emergency had been issued for areas between Fort Lauderdale and Miami. Six flash flood warnings are in effect across different parts of South Florida into Wednesday evening, according to Miami's National Weather Service office, which warned of another 5 to 7 inches of rain an hour that \"will make flooding even worse.\" The warnings were coupled with a severe thunderstorm warning.\n\nDouble-digit rain totals were being realized across a populous stretch of South Florida amid a dayslong torrential rainstorm that will bring downpours through Friday. Some weather stations near Hollywood showed nearly a foot of rain had fallen Wednesday alone. Storm total rainfall may exceed 18 inches in spots.\n\nStormwater pumps rumbled to life to help push the rainwater out to sea, but they couldn't drain fast enough to avoid flooding streets and airport tarmacs. Pools of water left low-lying parts of downtown Miami and Brickell impassable. And though the sun wouldn't set for another three hours, drivers flicked on their headlights and hazards as they warily navigated the flooded streets.\n\nFlood watches were scheduled to cover South Florida, including Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Fort Myers and Naples, and were extended through Thursday evening.\n\nRare flash flood emergency issued\n\nA dire flash flood emergency was issued for Dania Beach and Hollywood during the late afternoon hours where 6 to 10 inches of rain had already fallen. Another 3 to 7 inches was anticipated as a band of slow-moving torrential downpours rode west to east along Alligator Alley, or Interstate 75. It was set to expire at 5 p.m. Eastern.\n\nA personal weather station in Hollywood Beach, had tallied 11.59 inches of rain in five hours' time, with several others logging 11.11 inches.\n\nThrough 5:40 p.m., 8.61 inches had fallen at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. That's the third-wettest day on record at the airport, and it's the all-time June record. If the airport makes it to 10.22 inches, then Wednesday's rainfall may claim the second-place spot.\n\nFort Lauderdale also had its sixth-wettest hour on record between 1 and 2 p.m. Wednesday, when 2.41 inches fell.\n\nAnother weather station in Hollywood was up to 11.6 inches for the calendar day, 11.19 of which came down in just six hours. Statistically, that's an event that should happen on average once every 100 to 200 years.\n\nIt's been just over a year since catastrophic and unprecedented flooding dumped 22.5 inches of rain on the airport on April 12, 2023, and forced its closure.\n\nIncreased rainfall rates and more extreme flooding events are strongly linked to human-induced climate change. A warmer world is a wetter world by virtue of the fact that warm air can hold, and transport, more moisture. For every degree the air temperature warms, the air can hold more moisture.\n\nEven though hourly record-keeping dates back to 1973 at Fort Lauderdale International, seven of the wettest hours on record have occurred in the past 10 years, and all have occurred since 2003.\n\nExcessive rain across South Florida\n\nAt Sarasota Bradenton International Airport, 3.93 inches fell in a single hour between 7 and 8 p.m. Tuesday, the highest one-hour rain total observed there since hourly observations began in 1972. Some locations saw 8 inches in three hours' time, an event that on average has just a 0.1 percent chance of happening in any given year.\n\nDowntown Sarasota was virtually impassible for a time during the height of the rainfall, which left streets and intersections submerged as water lapped at area businesses. Some 9.15 inches of rain had been reported at the IMG Academy in nearby Bradenton to start the day.\n\nThe same storm system could even acquire some marginal tropical characteristics and is being monitored by the National Hurricane Center. It's unlikely to develop but is a sign that the oceans are heating up, and it won't be long before the atmosphere becomes conducive to the formation of tropical storms and hurricanes. In the unlikely event the system does mature, which the Hurricane Center estimates has only a 20 percent likelihood, it would be given the name Alberto.\n\nRainfall totals as of Wednesday evening\n\nThe heaviest rain was concentrated in a west to east zone along Alligator Alley, or Interstate 75. Some rural locations had exceeded 15 inches by 5:30 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday. Here's a roundup of 72 hour totals; note that, in the greater Miami-Ft. Lauderdale area, most fell just on Wednesday:\n\n14.94 inches along Alligator Alley in rural Collier County\n\n8.27 inches at the Sarasota Bradenton International Airport\n\nIn addition, multiple tornado warnings were issued Wednesday morning as a few thunderstorms acquired rotation, probably because of spin in the vicinity of a stalled front over the area. One warning was for a \"confirmed tornado\" that was approaching Alligator Alley, the main west-east highway between Naples and Fort Lauderdale that bisects the Everglades. Radar confirmed debris lofted by the tornado. Another tornado warning was issued for a second storm shortly thereafter; that storm passed east of the Miccosukee Service Plaza.\n\nA third warning, which was posted for 10:32 a.m., covered a storm in Martin County just south of Port St. Lucie that was also capable of producing a tornado. The National Weather Service was planning to investigate a possible tornado touchdown with that cell in Hobe Sound. A few additional tornado warnings may be issued before the event winds down Friday.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe showers and storms will continue into late Friday, primarily south of a line from Tampa to the Space Coast. By Saturday, storms will become more scattered - typical of summer afternoons in the Sunshine State, though the remnant front may act as a focal mechanism for greater storm coverage.\n\nThat's around the time the low-pressure system will pull northeast into the Northwest Atlantic, and the downpours over South Florida will relent. The surface low may acquire subtropical characteristics as it moves over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nHow much rain has fallen?\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nHow unusual is this?\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nWhat weather pattern is causing repeated rains?\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise. The other is what forecasters call the \"central American gyre,\" a low-pressure area of storms spinning counterclockwise in the western Caribbean Sea that appears every spring.\n\n\"These two features essentially created a channel that funneled moisture from the Caribbean up and into Florida,\" DaSilva said. \"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode. We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation.\"\n\nWhat are flash floods in Florida?\n\nFlorida differs from other places prone to flash flooding because it is flat and doesn't have dry riverbeds or gullies that suddenly become raging torrents capable of washing away entire buildings.\n\nIn Florida, the heavy rains can overwhelm drainage and pumping systems, leaving the water nowhere to go. So it can suddenly switch from a few inches to a couple feet of water in a roadway in a matter of minutes -- enough to stall a car engine and make it float away.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a rare flash flood emergency, which forecasters define as conditions that are imminently life-threatening or likely to cause property damage. In this case, it was mostly about vehicles stuck on flooded roads. About half of flood deaths happen to people who can't escape their cars.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect in South Florida through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIs there any silver lining?\n\nDrought conditions existed before these storms in many parts of Florida, especially the Gulf Coast from the Tampa Bay area south to Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nIt got so bad in Sarasota that officials declared a drought emergency and urged people to conserve water until the annual rainy season began -- usually around the same time as the June 1 start of hurricane season, which lasts until Nov. 30.\n\nParts of Sarasota got pummeled with 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a single hour Tuesday, an event weather forecasters say happens only every 500 years. Significant rainfall happened in other sections of the county as well.\n\n\"This rainfall should eliminate most, if not all of the drought conditions across South Florida,\" DaSilva said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Parts of the Sunshine State were drenched by up to ten inches of rain on Tuesday, as more than a month's rainfall fell in a single night.\n\nMiami and Fort Lauderdale were among the worst hit, but many counties remain under flash flood alerts. Forecasters are still warning motorists to avoid I-75, where four inches of rain had fallen in a single hour on Wednesday. Flights were also disrupted, with more than 120 journeys cancelled or delayed due to the record-breaking rain between midday on Tuesday and this afternoon, according to Flight Aware.\n\nVideo on social media showed submerged vehicles struggling to make it across flooded roads in Sarasota, while stalled vehicles sat in soaked streets in Aventura. There were similar scenes in Miami, where a heavy storm system was seen hanging above the skies before the torrent fell.\n\n'Significant rainfall has fallen in a short period of time, likely leading to impassable roadways over metropolitan portions of Miami-Dade County, specifically near Downtown Miami and surrounding neighborhoods,' The National Weather Service Wrote. 'Remember never to attempt to drive through flooded roadways.'\n\nThe Tampa Bay area was hit by eight inches of rain in three hours, a meteorological event so rare it is only expected once every 500 to 1,000 years. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable for vehicles, including a section of major artery Interstate 95 in Broward County. The Florida Highway Patrol said southbound traffic was being diverted around the flooded section.\n\nThis closure will remain until further notice and water drains from the interstate. Contractors are en route to pump the drainage system,' FHP said in an email. Floridians are being urged to exercise caution, as there is no sign of the rain letting up anytime soon. 'Rainfall rates of 1-3'/hour to continue across already soaked regions of South FL, producing additional localized totals of 5'+,' the National Weather Service wrote. 'Isolated to scattered instances of flash flooding likely.'\n\nThe downpours are expected to continue until Saturday, with the National Hurricane Center highlighting an area of low pressure over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The rain comes after swathes of Florida has been left parched by spring time droughts which are now exacerbating flooding. The dry spells have left soil hydrophobic, meaning it is less able to absorb the excess moisture, especially in urban areas.\n\nSarasota, which has seen some of the biggest floods, has had 25 inches less rain than it normally would since the start of 2023, the driest on record. The deluge comes amid forecasts of an unusually busy hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates there is an 85 percent chance that the Atlantic hurricane season will be above average.\n\nIt is predicting between 17 and 25 named storms in the coming months including up to 13 hurricanes and four major hurricanes. An average season has 14 named storms. Florida's rainy season roughly begins in June with the start of the six-month hurricane season, which this year is forecast to be among the most active in recent memory.\n\nThe disturbance had not reached cyclone status as of Tuesday and was given only a slight chance to form into a tropical system once it emerges into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n'Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,' the hurricane center posted on its website Wednesday.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Many flights were either canceled or delayed due to the bad weather. (Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald via AP)\n\nA series of storms flowing from the Gulf of Mexico swamped South Florida with flash floods that stalled cars, forced the cancellation of dozens of flights and generally made life miserable for tens of thousands of people.\n\nFlat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days when so-called king tides surge in coastal areas. And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHow much rain has fallen?\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHow unusual is this?\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nWhat weather pattern is causing repeated rains?\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise. The other is what forecasters call the \"central American gyre,\" a low-pressure area of storms spinning counterclockwise in the western Caribbean Sea that appears every spring.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"These two features essentially created a channel that funneled moisture from the Caribbean up and into Florida,\" DaSilva said. \"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode. We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation.\"\n\nWhat are flash floods in Florida?\n\nFlorida differs from other places prone to flash flooding because it is flat and doesn't have dry riverbeds or gullies that suddenly become raging torrents capable of washing away entire buildings.\n\nIn Florida, the heavy rains can overwhelm drainage and pumping systems, leaving the water nowhere to go. So it can suddenly switch from a few inches to a couple feet of water in a roadway in a matter of minutes -- enough to stall a car engine and make it float away.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a rare flash flood emergency, which forecasters define as conditions that are imminently life-threatening or likely to cause property damage. In this case, it was mostly about vehicles stuck on flooded roads. About half of flood deaths happen to people who can't escape their cars.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect in South Florida through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nIs there any silver lining?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDrought conditions existed before these storms in many parts of Florida, especially the Gulf Coast from the Tampa Bay area south to Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nIt got so bad in Sarasota that officials declared a drought emergency and urged people to conserve water until the annual rainy season began -- usually around the same time as the June 1 start of hurricane season, which lasts until Nov. 30.\n\nParts of Sarasota got pummeled with 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a single hour Tuesday, an event weather forecasters say happens only every 500 years. Significant rainfall happened in other sections of the county as well.\n\n\"This rainfall should eliminate most, if not all of the drought conditions across South Florida,\" DaSilva said.", "source":

Ron DeSantis also declared a state of emergency for five counties -- Broward and Miami-Dade counties on Florida's Atlantic coast and Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the state's west coast.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center gave the disturbance only a small chance of forming into a tropical system after it crosses Florida.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula through late this week,\" the hurricane center said on its website early Thursday.\n\nThe NWS has extended flood watches for much of south Florida through Friday, with some places forecast to receive up to another 8 inches of rain.\n\n\"These additional rainfall amounts will be capable of producing additional flooding on top of current flooding ongoing across portions of South Florida,\" the weather service warned.\n\n\"You should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible Flood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Hundreds of flights at Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport were either delayed or canceled, according to flightaware.com. Roadways at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood airport could also become inundated, the airport warned. Footage posted to social media appeared to show swamped shopping strips and cars submerged in the floodwaters, including at an indoor parking lot.\n\nMayor Dean J. Trantalis of Fort Lauderdale said on social media that resources were being mobilized across the city, and that he was in the process of declaring a state of emergency. \"If possible, please avoid driving,\" he said. \"It's crucial to never attempt to drive through high water.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Weather Service issued its highest level of warning, a flash flood emergency, for a stretch spanning from North Miami to Dania Beach. \"The amount of rain that was falling was quickly overwhelming the drainage systems,\" said Mr. Reynes, the meteorologist. \"It was becoming a life-threatening situation.\"\n\nLike the cars of a train, storm after storm moved from the west coast to the east coast of the southern Florida Peninsula on Wednesday, soaking an area already saturated from the rain.\n\nForecasters warned that the line of storms was slowly meandering to the south, and expected rain to continue into the evening in areas already under flash flood warnings, including Miami. One to three inches of rain could continue to fall per hour.\n\nExcessive rain is forecast again on Thursday across southern Florida, though exactly where the heaviest rain will fall isn't certain. Considering the amounts that fell Wednesday, and the repetitive nature of the rainstorms, forecasters from the Weather Prediction Center said that more flash flooding was possible late Thursday

One video showed a flooded street full of abandoned cars in Aventura, a city north of Miami.

And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise. The other is what forecasters call the \"central American gyre,\" a low-pressure area of storms spinning counterclockwise in the western Caribbean Sea that appears every spring.\n\n\"These two features essentially created a channel that funneled moisture from the Caribbean up and into Florida,\" DaSilva said. \"It is essentially a fire hose turned on jet mode. We also have a stalled front across Florida, which has helped to enhance the precipitation.\"\n\nFlorida differs from other places prone to flash flooding because it is flat and doesn't have dry riverbeds or gullies that suddenly become raging torrents capable of washing away entire buildings.\n\nIn Florida, the heavy rains can overwhelm drainage and pumping systems, leaving the water nowhere to go. So it can suddenly switch from a few inches to a couple feet of water in a roadway in a matter of minutes -- enough to stall a car engine and make it float away.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Miami issued a rare flash flood emergency, which forecasters define as conditions that are imminently life-threatening or likely to cause property damage. In this case, it was mostly about vehicles stuck on flooded roads. About half of flood deaths happen to people who can't escape their cars.\n\nA flash flood watch remains in effect in South Florida through Friday, the National Weather Service said.\n\nDrought conditions existed before these storms in many parts of Florida, especially the Gulf Coast from the Tampa Bay area south to Fort Myers and Naples.\n\nIt got so bad in Sarasota that officials declared a drought emergency and urged people to conserve water until the annual rainy season began -- usually around the same time as the June 1 start of hurricane season, which lasts until Nov. 30.\n\nParts of Sarasota got pummeled with 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a single hour Tuesday, an event weather forecasters say happens only every 500 years. Significant rainfall happened in other sections of the county as well.\n\n\"This rainfall should eliminate most, if not all of the drought conditions across South Florida,\" DaSilva said.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

And tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and overwhelm drainage systems and the region's canals.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Florida's latest floods.\n\nThe National Weather Service estimates that from Tuesday through Wednesday about 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain deluged the hardest-hit spots, including Hallandale Beach and Hollywood, both near Fort Lauderdale, and roughly the same amount in North Miami.\n\nMiami Beach, which frequently floods in less powerful storms, got about 13 inches (33 centimeters).\n\nForecasts call for more rain Thursday that would likely cause additional flooding because the ground is already saturated.\n\nJune is typically the wettest month in Miami, with annual average rainfall of more than 10 inches (25 centimeters), said Alex DaSilva, AccuWeather's lead hurricane forecaster.\n\n\"What is unusual is how much rain South Florida has seen in such a short period of time,\" DaSilva said.\n\nIt has happened many times before. In one recent example, Fort Lauderdale was hit hard in April 2023 with record rainfall totals ranging from 15 inches (38 centimeters) to 26 inches (66 centimeters). Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.\n\nTwo persistent weather systems are behind the Florida floods, DaSilva said.\n\nOne is an area of high pressure off the southeastern coast that spins clockwise.

Since midnight, Miami Beach has recorded 6.95 inches of rainfall, while Hallandale has seen 6.01 inches. Other notable totals include 5.02 inches in Miami Shores, 4.41 inches in North Miami, and 3.82 inches in Hollywood.\n\nThe relentless downpour has put immense pressure on the drainage systems.\n\nA street flood advisory was issued for parts of Miami-Dade County, which include Miami and Hialeah and will remain in effect until 3:30 p.m. A flash flood warning will remain in effect until 3 p.m.\n\nIn Miami, floodwaters surged through Brickell Avenue and Southeast 14th Street, causing cars to create large wakes. The rushing water flowed down South Miami Avenue, affecting businesses such as Paperfish and Sexy Fish, with sidewalks submerged.\n\nPumps were seen working at 6250 Tamiami Canal Road and people were seen wearing trash bags as rain boots as they wade through water on Wednesday.\n\nResidents in Edgewater said the roadways there flood often.\n\n\"I lost a car once there,\" said a resident. \"This is my second car 'cause of one my cars was parked where the flooding was happening, so like it died.\"\n\nA manhole cover was pushed up by the force of the water on Brickell Bay Drive, and another near the Brightline station in Downtown Miami experienced similar issues.\n\n\"Some of the flooding is pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie,\" said Ethan, a local resident caught in the rain with friends, who chose to brave the weather for an unusual evening activity.\n\nIn Miami Beach, the streets were heavily flooded, with areas like 71st Street, Harding Avenue, Alton Road, and 46th Street becoming impassable. One resident described seeing Corvettes almost underwater, estimating thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nSeattle native, John Martin is visiting for a cruise and he says maneuvering the local streets weren't easy, but he also faced some challenges at the airport.\n\n\"Yea this is crazy, I spent a lot of my life in Seattle, but we don't get flooding like this\", said Martin. \"Getting here was quiet difficult, so yesterday our flight was delayed four hours.\"\n\nBusinesses in Miami Beach are facing significant cleanup costs as floodwaters continue to seep in. Sheets of rain have reduced visibility from high-rises and slowed traffic on Interstate 95 near the 836 interchange, despite pumps working in overdrive to manage the water.\n\n\"It's a little annoying, but I mean, we will deal with it,\" another resident commented on the ongoing challenges.\n\nDue to the weather, Zoo Miami was closed early.\n\nOver in Broward County, the National Weather Service earlier on Tuesday issued a tornado warning, which has since expired. A street flood advisory was issued for Fort Lauderdale and Pembroke Pines, which will be in effect until 2:30 p.m.\n\nDuring the morning, a tree branch in Hollywood fell onto someone's truck at the intersection of of Johnson Street and 59th Avenue.\n\n\"Heavy wind. Was a very heavy wind,\" said a resident who heard the tree's limbs fall off.\n\nAnother resident hear the commotion outside.\n\n\"I was in the bathroom getting ready to start my day and I just heard rumbling and dogs barking, and I'm like, 'What's going on?' and I a few minutes passed and I go outside and all, everything is destroyed in the backyard,\" said Kristina. \"It was strong, for sure. I think something must have touched down. There's damage around the whole neighborhood, so I don't really know. It's isolated damage.\"\n\nIn Hallandale, six inches of rain on Tuesday led to the temporary closure of Hallandale Beach Boulevard due to severe flooding. Although the avenue has since reopened, the forecast suggests more rain is on the way for South Florida residents.\n\nSeveral areas were reported flooding has occurred included the following:\n\nNorthwest 27th Avenue between Broward Boulevard and Sunrise Broward. Stirling Road east of Federal Higway in Dania Beach1500 W. Davie Broward in the Fort Lauderdale area around St. Thomas Aquinas1389 Riverland Road in Fort Lauderdale800 NE 8th Street in Fort LauderdaleState Road 84 near Southwest Fourth Avenue\n\nCommunities across South Florida are experiencing similar conditions. In Surfside, water gushed into a residential parking garage on 92nd Street and Collins Avenue.\n\nOpa-locka saw residential streets flooded, with even a Brinks truck struggling through deep puddles. Hialeah's mobile home community on West 29th Street was inundated, and residents had to navigate significant flooding.\n\nDania Beach and Hollywood also reported heavy flooding, with rain pouring down on the Turnpike and causing traffic issues on I-95 during rush hour.\n\nBroward County officials have proactively prepared for the continued rainfall by clearing debris from storm drains to facilitate water flow.\n\n\"We know this whole week and probably on through next week, based on the forecast, we're going to experience a lot of rain,\" one official stated.\n\nCounty cruise are working around the clock monitoring the drains in flood prone areas.\n\n\"We are going to different locations throughout the county that we know are prone to flooding,\" said the official.\n\nTeams have been dispatched to flood-prone locations to mitigate the impact.\n\nAir travel in and out of South Florida is also affected by the heavy rainfalls. Planes are seen pilled up on the runway of Fort Lauderdale International Airport causing flight delays for nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAccording to Flight Aware incoming planes to FLL are being held and diverted. Average wait times are roughly two hours.\n\nAt Miami International Airport, 117 flights have been delayed and 125 flights were canceled due to weather.\n\nTravelers are strongly advised to confirm their flights with their airlines before heading to either airport.\n\nAs South Florida continues to cope with the adverse weather, residents are urged to stay safe and remain informed about the inclement weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

Forecasters are urging residents in some areas to seek high ground and avoid drenched roads.\n\nAround 4 p.m., the National Weather Service received several reports of heavy rainfall in parts of Miami-Dade and Broward counties.\n\nThe downpours caused the weather service to issue a flood warning for northern Miami-Dade and southern Broward counties that's expected to last until 8 p.m.\n\nA reported 2 to 4 inches of rain fell in northern Miami-Dade, with an additional 2 to 5 inches possibly coming down. In southern Broward, 2 to 4 inches fell, with an estimated 1 to 4 inches on the way.\n\nCities affected include Miami, Miami Beach, Hialeah, Opa-locka, Doral, Miami Gardens, Sunrise, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale and Sunrise.\n\nForecasters say life-threatening flash flooding may impact creeks, streams, urban areas, highways and streets. Residents are being warned to turn around and avoid driving through flooded areas.\n\nIn Miami Beach, cars waded through water several inches deep during the evening rush hour commute. On Alton Road in Mid-Beach, drivers merged into a single lane to try to avoid the worst of the flooding.\n\nMeanwhile in North Beach, parts of a Publix parking lot sat empty because the spots had filled up with water.\n\nResidents on social media shared images of flooding throughout Miami Beach. The city activated a program that lets residents park for free in two public garages, at 400 West 42nd St. and 1661 Pennsylvania Ave.\n\nMiami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties will remain under a flood watch until Wednesday evening, meaning residents should be prepared for the possibility of flooding. Forecasters attribute this to slow-moving storms in the area with heavy showers.\n\nREAD MORE: Hurricane center tracking system drenching South Florida.

The Florida Highway Patrol shut down a portion of Interstate 95 in Broward County due to flooding caused by the heavy rainfall, according to an agency post on the social-media platform X.\n\nAlready, several daily rainfall records were set on Tuesday, including 6.47 inches (16 centimeters) in the Sarasota-Bradenton area and 3.3 inches in Fort Lauderdale, the National Weather Service said. Miami International Airport got 3.59 inches, just shy of the all-time high for that date.\n\nThe deluge will continue through the weekend as the showers slowly shift southward, said Peter Mullinax, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center. As much as 6 more inches may fall through late Thursday,. with some areas getting as much as 9 inches, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"It is quite active down there,\" Mullinax said by phone. \"As the day unfolds there will be another resurgence of storms.\"\n\nThe rains are coming from an elongated low-pressure system pinned to the area by high-pressure systems in the central US and the Caribbean that have allowed moisture to flow inland from the Gulf of Mexico. There is a 20% chance the showers will strengthen into the Atlantic's first tropical storm, which would be named Alberto, in the next seven days, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nStorms early in the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1, often form close to the US coast from systems that moved across North America. These storms aren't usually as powerful as later hurricanes and don't really give a clue as to what the rest of the season will bring.\n\nHowever, forecasters are expecting an active year. Colorado State University is predicting 23 named storms across the Atlantic, with 11 becoming hurricanes and five growing into major systems with winds of 111 miles (179 kilometers) per hour or more. On average, about 14 named storms form in the Atlantic during the season.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

And on Thursday more rain is on the way, likely pushing losses over $1 billion.\n\nIn the worst case as much as 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain may fall on soaked ground across southern Florida, leading to more flooding, said Sammy Hadi, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Miami. There may be isolated spots that get even more.\n\nOn Wednesday, 9.54 inches fell in Fort Lauderdale, the most ever for a June day. The downpour closed ramps to the airport and flooded city streets. The wider deluge led to parts of Interstate-95 to be closed, hundreds of flights to be canceled and Governor Ron DeSantis to declare an emergency in several counties including Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier, Lee and Sarasota.\n\nThe rain fell so hard and fast it forced the weather service to issue only its second ever emergency flood warning for southern Florida's east coast, Hadi said. The National Hurricane Center is tracking the system responsible, but says it has not yet reached the level of a tropical storm.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it has a name or not, if it drops 9 inches in 24 hours there are going to be big problems,\" Hadi said.\n\nDamages are likely to top out at $1 billion or more, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. With the rising cost of homes and automobiles, as well as the population growth across the region, it isn't hard for a storm to cause more than $1 billion in damages across South Florida.\n\nThe ocean around Florida is record warm in some areas and the atmosphere is holding tremendous amounts of water vapor. In Miami on Wednesday, measurements recorded the second highest amount of moisture in the air for a June day, according to a Substack post by Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG-TV in Miami and former US National Hurricane Center scientist.\n\n\"With plenty of heat at hand, and so much water vapor, it didn't take much of a disturbance to trigger heavy rains,\" said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and author with Yale Climate Connections.\n\nParallels are already being drawn to an April 2023 event that also flooded the Fort Lauderdale region and cost at least $1.1 billion in losses, closed the city's airport and brought more than 25 inches of rain in 24 hours, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n\"It's uncanny how this event resembles the epic flooding in Fort Lauderdale from April 2023,\" Henson said. \"Getting two events in less than 15 months should be wake-up call for anyone who's been dozing through the overlapping insurance and climate crises in South Florida.\"\n\nWith more rain on the way, 246 flights have already been canceled in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and other Florida airports, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

Since midnight, Miami Beach has recorded 6.95 inches of rainfall, while Hallandale has seen 6.01 inches. Other notable totals include 5.02 inches in Miami Shores, 4.41 inches in North Miami, and 3.82 inches in Hollywood.\n\nThe relentless downpour has put immense pressure on the drainage systems.\n\nA street flood emergency was issued for parts of Miami-Dade County and Broward and was later extended. A flash flood warning for portions of Miami-Dade and South Broward will remain in effect until 8 p.m., and a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for a wide swath of Miami-Dade until 5 p.m.\n\nIn Miami, floodwaters surged through Brickell Avenue and Southeast 14th Street, causing cars to create large wakes. The rushing water flowed down South Miami Avenue, affecting businesses such as Paperfish and Sexy Fish, with sidewalks submerged.\n\nPumps were seen working at 6250 Tamiami Canal Road and people were seen wearing trash bags as rain boots as they wade through water on Wednesday.\n\nResidents in Edgewater said the roadways there flood often.\n\n\"I lost a car once there,\" said a resident. \"This is my second car 'cause of one my cars was parked where the flooding was happening, so like it died.\"\n\nA manhole cover was pushed up by the force of the water on Brickell Bay Drive, and another near the Brightline station in Downtown Miami experienced similar issues.\n\n\"Some of the flooding is pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie,\" said Ethan, a local resident caught in the rain with friends, who chose to brave the weather for an unusual evening activity.\n\nIn Miami Beach, the streets were heavily flooded, with areas like 71st Street, Harding Avenue, Alton Road, and 46th Street becoming impassable. One resident described seeing Corvettes almost underwater, estimating thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nA man was seen standing on the corner of 71st and Abbott Avenue, the water was up to his knees.\n\nRight across the street, water filled up a Chevron gas station.\n\n\"Look down the street. It's messed up. You could sail a boat or walk a shark,\" said the man.\n\nSeattle native John Martin is visiting for a cruise and he says maneuvering the local streets weren't easy, but he also faced some challenges at the airport.\n\n\"Yea this is crazy, I spent a lot of my life in Seattle, but we don't get flooding like this\", said Martin. \"Getting here was quiet difficult, so yesterday our flight was delayed four hours.\"\n\nBusinesses in Miami Beach are facing significant cleanup costs as floodwaters continue to seep in. Sheets of rain have reduced visibility from high-rises and slowed traffic on Interstate 95 near the 836 interchange, despite pumps working in overdrive to manage the water.\n\n\"It's a little annoying, but I mean, we will deal with it,\" another resident commented on the ongoing challenges.\n\nDue to the weather, Zoo Miami was closed early.\n\nOver in Broward County, the National Weather Service earlier on Tuesday issued a tornado warning, which has since expired. A flash flood advisory was issued which will be in effect until 5:30 p.m.\n\nAll libraries in Broward County have closed down due to the weather.\n\nDuring the morning, a tree branch in Hollywood fell onto someone's truck at the intersection of of Johnson Street and 59th Avenue.\n\n\"Heavy wind. Was a very heavy wind,\" said a resident who heard the tree's limbs fall off.\n\nAnother resident hear the commotion outside.\n\n\"I was in the bathroom getting ready to start my day and I just heard rumbling and dogs barking, and I'm like, 'What's going on?' and I a few minutes passed and I go outside and all, everything is destroyed in the backyard,\" said Kristina. \"It was strong, for sure. I think something must have touched down. There's damage around the whole neighborhood, so I don't really know. It's isolated damage.\"\n\nIn Hallandale, six inches of rain on Tuesday led to the temporary closure of Hallandale Beach Boulevard due to severe flooding. Although the avenue has since reopened, the forecast suggests more rain is on the way for South Florida residents.\n\nSeveral residents throughout Broward County have dealt with flooding at their homes.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in and we're ready to go,\" said Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nCommunities across South Florida are experiencing similar conditions. In Surfside, water gushed into a residential parking garage on 92nd Street and Collins Avenue.\n\nOpa-locka saw residential streets flooded, with even a Brinks truck struggling through deep puddles. Hialeah's mobile home community on West 29th Street was inundated, and residents had to navigate significant flooding.\n\nDania Beach and Hollywood also reported heavy flooding, with rain pouring down on the Turnpike and causing traffic issues on I-95 during rush hour.\n\nBroward County officials have proactively prepared for the continued rainfall by clearing debris from storm drains to facilitate water flow.\n\n\"We know this whole week and probably on through next week, based on the forecast, we're going to experience a lot of rain,\" one official stated.\n\nCounty cruise are working around the clock monitoring the drains in flood prone areas.\n\n\"We are going to different locations throughout the county that we know are prone to flooding,\" said the official.\n\nTeams have been dispatched to flood-prone locations to mitigate the impact.\n\nAir travel in and out of South Florida is also affected by the heavy rainfalls. Planes are seen pilled up on the runway of Fort Lauderdale International Airport causing flight delays for nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAccording to Flight Aware incoming planes to FLL are being held and diverted and average wait times are roughly two hours.\n\nAt the airport, there have been 144 cancellations with 74 arrivals and 70 departures and 70 delays with 29 arrivals and 41 departures.\n\nOver at Miami International Airport, 165 flights have been delayed and 221 flights have been canceled due to weather.\n\nTravelers are strongly advised to confirm their flights with their airlines before heading to either airport.\n\nAs South Florida continues to cope with the adverse weather, residents are urged to stay safe and remain informed about the inclement weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

More rain is on the way", "body": "An early June deluge has once again turned South Florida's roads and parks into rivers and lakes, snarling traffic and sending residents sloshing through streets, shoes in hand. And it's not done yet.\n\nWhile the rainfall levels are still largely within the normal limits South Florida's drainage system is designed to handle (so far), the downpour has revealed the weak spots in the system -- neighborhoods, streets and even homes that routinely flood during heavy rainstorms.\n\nAlfredo Rodriguez moved into St. Edward's Apartments in the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami a year ago, and he said it's flooded five times since he got here. The lobby of his building had a half inch of water puddled inside on Wednesday morning, hours after the rain had stopped.\n\n\"It was a surprise to me. I want to leave this place in the next three months. This is horrible. I can't pull my car around,\" he said.\n\nOutside, a city of Miami employee manned a loud, sputtering piece of machinery designed for these situations, a temporary stormwater pump. The employee noted the pump was \"doing its job,\" yet cars on the bay front street sat in water up to their front bumper.\n\nMiami deployed 12 of its 14 temporary pumps for this flood event, including the one on Rodriguez' street, in addition to the city's 13 permanent pump stations. Miami also sicced a squad of ten roving vactor trucks on the flooding hot spots, large trucks that suck up excess water on the street.\n\nTELL US: Has your home or street flooded in South Florida? We want to hear about it\n\nMiami saw about 4 to 6 inches of rain on Tuesday alone, according to preliminary results from the Miami office of the National Weather Service. Miami Beach saw even more, at nearly 7 inches.\n\nThe scene was similar in Broward, with around 6 inches in Hallandale and 5 inches in Hollywood. The Fort Lauderdale airport set a new record for June 11 at 3.3 inches in a single day, beating a record of 3.1 inches in 1997.\n\nShawn Bhatti, a meteorologist at the NWS's Miami office, said Miami-Dade is expected to see another 5 to 7 inches of rain through Saturday morning, and Broward could see 4 to 6.5 inches.\n\nWhile it's unclear where, exactly, the brunt of that rain may fall, it could be a double whammy of water to places like Brickell, Downtown Miami and Miami Beach, which were hit the hardest in the first round of rain on Tuesday.\n\n\"They're going to be pretty sensitive to more flooding in the next few days,\" Bhatti said.\n\nThat additional rain total could strain drainage efforts in South Florida even further.\n\nIn 2022, a would-be tropical system passed over South Florida and dropped 15 inches of rain in just a few days. Hundreds of cars were stalled out in the floodwaters, and more than a hundred people called Miami-Dade's 311 line with flood complaints.\n\nREAD MORE: Flood of troubles: Why Miami-Dade's drainage problems won't be fixed anytime soon\n\nThis time, the conditions are similar. The National Hurricane Center is tracking a disturbance that's crossing the state, dumping a veritable rain train of water. The hurricane center gives it a low chance of strengthening into a tropical depression -- just 20% -- by the time it emerges on the east coast.\n\nBut, for now, South Florida's rainfall isn't classified as a tropical system. It's \"just\" rain, except at levels usually only seen with tropical storms or hurricanes.\n\n\"It is fairly unusual, especially to see this wide of a swath over the region, Bhatti said.", "source":

Since midnight, Miami Beach has recorded 6.95 inches of rainfall, while Hallandale has seen 6.01 inches. Other notable totals include 5.02 inches in Miami Shores, 4.41 inches in North Miami, and 3.82 inches in Hollywood.\n\nThe relentless downpour has put immense pressure on the drainage systems.\n\nA street flood emergency was issued for parts of Miami-Dade County and Broward and was later extended. A flash flood warning will remain in effect until 8 p.m., and a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for a wide swath of Miami-Dade until 5 p.m.\n\nIn Miami, floodwaters surged through Brickell Avenue and Southeast 14th Street, causing cars to create large wakes. The rushing water flowed down South Miami Avenue, affecting businesses such as Paperfish and Sexy Fish, with sidewalks submerged.\n\nPumps were seen working at 6250 Tamiami Canal Road and people were seen wearing trash bags as rain boots as they wade through water on Wednesday.\n\nResidents in Edgewater said the roadways there flood often.\n\n\"I lost a car once there,\" said a resident. \"This is my second car 'cause of one my cars was parked where the flooding was happening, so like it died.\"\n\nA manhole cover was pushed up by the force of the water on Brickell Bay Drive, and another near the Brightline station in Downtown Miami experienced similar issues.\n\n\"Some of the flooding is pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie,\" said Ethan, a local resident caught in the rain with friends, who chose to brave the weather for an unusual evening activity.\n\nIn Miami Beach, the streets were heavily flooded, with areas like 71st Street, Harding Avenue, Alton Road, and 46th Street becoming impassable. One resident described seeing Corvettes almost underwater, estimating thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nA man was seen standing on the corner of 71st and Abbott Avenue, the water was up to his knees.\n\nRight across the street, water filled up a Chevron gas station.\n\n\"Look down the street. It's messed up. You could sail a boat or walk a shark,\" said the man.\n\nSeattle native John Martin is visiting for a cruise and he says maneuvering the local streets weren't easy, but he also faced some challenges at the airport.\n\n\"Yea this is crazy, I spent a lot of my life in Seattle, but we don't get flooding like this\", said Martin. \"Getting here was quiet difficult, so yesterday our flight was delayed four hours.\"\n\nBusinesses in Miami Beach are facing significant cleanup costs as floodwaters continue to seep in. Sheets of rain have reduced visibility from high-rises and slowed traffic on Interstate 95 near the 836 interchange, despite pumps working in overdrive to manage the water.\n\n\"It's a little annoying, but I mean, we will deal with it,\" another resident commented on the ongoing challenges.\n\nDue to the weather, Zoo Miami was closed early.\n\nOver in Broward County, the National Weather Service earlier on Tuesday issued a tornado warning, which has since expired. A flash flood advisory was issued which will be in effect until 5:30 p.m.\n\nAll libraries in Broward County have closed down due to the weather.\n\nDuring the morning, a tree branch in Hollywood fell onto someone's truck at the intersection of of Johnson Street and 59th Avenue.\n\n\"Heavy wind. Was a very heavy wind,\" said a resident who heard the tree's limbs fall off.\n\nAnother resident hear the commotion outside.\n\n\"I was in the bathroom getting ready to start my day and I just heard rumbling and dogs barking, and I'm like, 'What's going on?' and I a few minutes passed and I go outside and all, everything is destroyed in the backyard,\" said Kristina. \"It was strong, for sure. I think something must have touched down. There's damage around the whole neighborhood, so I don't really know. It's isolated damage.\"\n\nIn Hallandale, six inches of rain on Tuesday led to the temporary closure of Hallandale Beach Boulevard due to severe flooding. Although the avenue has since reopened, the forecast suggests more rain is on the way for South Florida residents.\n\nSeveral residents throughout Broward County have dealt with flooding at their homes.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in and we're ready to go,\" said Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nCommunities across South Florida are experiencing similar conditions. In Surfside, water gushed into a residential parking garage on 92nd Street and Collins Avenue.\n\nOpa-locka saw residential streets flooded, with even a Brinks truck struggling through deep puddles. Hialeah's mobile home community on West 29th Street was inundated, and residents had to navigate significant flooding.\n\nDania Beach and Hollywood also reported heavy flooding, with rain pouring down on the Turnpike and causing traffic issues on I-95 during rush hour.\n\nBroward County officials have proactively prepared for the continued rainfall by clearing debris from storm drains to facilitate water flow.\n\n\"We know this whole week and probably on through next week, based on the forecast, we're going to experience a lot of rain,\" one official stated.\n\nCounty cruise are working around the clock monitoring the drains in flood prone areas.\n\n\"We are going to different locations throughout the county that we know are prone to flooding,\" said the official.\n\nTeams have been dispatched to flood-prone locations to mitigate the impact.\n\nAir travel in and out of South Florida is also affected by the heavy rainfalls. Planes are seen pilled up on the runway of Fort Lauderdale International Airport causing flight delays for nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAccording to Flight Aware incoming planes to FLL are being held and diverted and average wait times are roughly two hours.\n\nAt the airport, there have been 144 cancellations with 74 arrivals and 70 departures and 70 delays with 29 arrivals and 41 departures.\n\nOver at Miami International Airport, 117 flights have been delayed and 125 flights were canceled due to weather.\n\nTravelers are strongly advised to confirm their flights with their airlines before heading to either airport.\n\nAs South Florida continues to cope with the adverse weather, residents are urged to stay safe and remain informed about the inclement weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

The emergency is in effect until 8:00 pm.\n\nCities under the emergency advisory: Miami Gardens, North Miami Beach, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar and Dania Beach. Other urban city centers in both counties will see the greatest threat of flash flooding.\n\nForecasters say they've received numerous \"non-stop\" reports of flash flooding.

And on Thursday more rain is on the way, likely pushing losses over $1 billion.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nIn the worst case as much as 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rain may fall on soaked ground across southern Florida, leading to more flooding, said Sammy Hadi, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Miami. There may be isolated spots that get even more.\n\nOn Wednesday, 9.54 inches fell in Fort Lauderdale, the most ever for a June day. The downpour closed ramps to the airport and flooded city streets. The wider deluge led to parts of Interstate-95 to be closed, hundreds of flights to be canceled and Governor Ron DeSantis to declare an emergency in several counties including Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier, Lee and Sarasota.\n\nThe rain fell so hard and fast it forced the weather service to issue only its second ever emergency flood warning for southern Florida's east coast, Hadi said. The National Hurricane Center is tracking the system responsible, but says it has not yet reached the level of a tropical storm.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it has a name or not, if it drops 9 inches in 24 hours there are going to be big problems,\" Hadi said.\n\nDamages are likely to top out at $1 billion or more, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. With the rising cost of homes and automobiles, as well as the population growth across the region, it isn't hard for a storm to cause more than $1 billion in damages across South Florida.\n\nThe ocean around Florida is record warm in some areas and the atmosphere is holding tremendous amounts of water vapor. In Miami on Wednesday, measurements recorded the second highest amount of moisture in the air for a June day, according to a Substack post by Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG-TV in Miami and former US National Hurricane Center scientist.\n\n\"With plenty of heat at hand, and so much water vapor, it didn't take much of a disturbance to trigger heavy rains,\" said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and author with Yale Climate Connections.\n\nParallels are already being drawn to an April 2023 event that also flooded the Fort Lauderdale region and cost at least $1.1 billion in losses, closed the city's airport and brought more than 25 inches of rain in 24 hours, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n\"It's uncanny how this event resembles the epic flooding in Fort Lauderdale from April 2023,\" Henson said. \"Getting two events in less than 15 months should be wake-up call for anyone who's been dozing through the overlapping insurance and climate crises in South Florida.\"\n\nWith more rain on the way, 246 flights have already been canceled in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and other Florida airports, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Forecasters said there was potential for higher-end rainfall totals, with four to eight inches of additional rain likely and some locations potentially receiving over 10 inches of rain on Thursday.\n\nExactly where the heaviest rain will fall is unknown, but it will take only a little to exacerbate the ongoing flooding, warned forecasters, particularly in rural and urban locations that have already seen rain.\n\nFlood conditions were not expected to worsen early Thursday, but the next wave of rain will likely return by late morning and early afternoon.\n\nHeavy rainfall on Wednesday caused flash flooding from Fort Lauderdale to downtown Miami, battering major urban areas and shuttering roads, including part of the Interstate 95. The severity of the weather prompted Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to declare a state of emergency in Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties.\n\nThe floodwaters have swamped shopping strips, submerged cars and left residents in some neighborhoods wading waist-deep through the deluge. School officials in Parkland, Fla., also postponed plans to begin demolishing Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a former student killed 17 people in 2018, because of the weather.\n\nThere were no reports of injuries or deaths as of Thursday morning, but flood watches were still in place through Friday for parts of the state, the National Weather Service warned.\n\nTravelers on Thursday were still experiencing disruptions.

No injuries were reported.\n\nRecord rainfall wreaks havoc: South Florida experiences \"life threatening\" flooding, stalled cars, delayed flights\n\nThe highest rainfall amounts in Palm Beach County from early Tuesday through Thursday morning were measured northeast of Lion Country Safari in Loxahatchee with 9.5 inches tallied by the NWS.\n\nOther areas with high rainfall included Boca Raton (7.65 inches), Delray Beach (6.86 inches), Lantana (6.25 inches), Wellington (5.93 inches), West Palm Beach (5.09 inches), Lake Worth (5.04 inches), Jupiter (4.81 inches) and Palm Beach Gardens (4.49 inches).\n\nIn Broward County, the highest rainfall was in Hallandale Beach, where 19.39 inches of rain fell in about a 48-hour period through early Thursday.\n\n\"In this situation, conditions may deteriorate quickly,\" said NWS Miami meteorologist Tony Reynes on Thursday. \"There may be some sunshine this morning but it can change. We want to keep a very close eye on the vulnerable areas over the next 24 hours.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was open Thursday morning but travelers were asked to check with their airlines for flight updates.\n\n\"Our terminal and airport exit roadways are clear,\" the airport said on social media, noting, however, that a section of East Perimeter Road was closed because of flooding.\n\nThe heavy rainfall and flooding triggered a state of emergency declaration by Gov. Ron DeSantis for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. DeSantis also ordered the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard activated \"as needed.\"\n\nThe declaration frees agencies from red tape in responding to the emergency and allows local governments to access money in the state's Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund.\n\n2024 hurricane season: 5 tips to stay sane and safe in face of frightful forecast\n\nThrough Thursday morning, State Farm reported it had already received about 300 auto claims associated with the torrential downpours.\n\nFOX Weather hurricane specialist Bryan Norcross likened the weather pattern over Florida to the atmospheric rivers that are common along the west coast of the United States.\n\n\"It's a relatively narrow band of moisture squeezed between two competing weather systems,\" Norcross said in his Hurricane Intel blog. \"The warmer-than-normal waters to the south are undoubtedly enhancing the amount of moisture flowing over South Florida.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is watching two areas for potential tropical development. An area of low pressure that is helping pull moisture into the state is now in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of Florida. It has a 20% chance of becoming a named storm over the next two days.\n\nA second area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche is expected to form this weekend or early next week and has a 40% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe first two names on the 2024 hurricane list are Alberto and Beryl.\n\nAt this point, AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva said he doesn't expect the spot in the Bay of Campeche to impact Florida. He said it's more likely going to cause heavy rain in Mexico and possibly in Texas as far north as Houston.\n\nDaSilva said in addition to record warm sea surface temperatures, the depth of the ocean heat in the Gulf of Mexico is concerning. When water is deeply warm, it means a tropical cyclone won't churn up cooler water from below which can limit its growth.\n\n\"In the western Caribbean, there are areas right now where the 80-degree temperature line extends as deep as 300 to 400 feet below the surface,\" DaSilva said. \"That is something we would expect to see in August.\"\n\nTropical cyclones generally need water temperatures of 80 degrees or higher to form.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With up to 25 inches of rainfall, emergency declarations have been issued. Florida's Governor and local mayors are urging residents to avoid flooded areas and have mobilized resources for rescue operations.\n\nMore torrential downpours fell over South Florida on Thursday after at least a foot of rain deluged an area spanning the Gulf Coast into Miami this week, leading the National Weather Service to issue flood watches or warnings for 8 million people.\n\nSome areas, including portions of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, are seeing \"life-threatening flooding,\" the weather service said. A few spots have reported up to 18-to-25 inches of rain since Monday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the NWS's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.\n\nThe slow-moving storm - a disorganized tropical depression drawing its strength from warm Gulf Coast and Atlantic waters - is expected to linger over the state until early Saturday before pushing out to sea, Oravec said. Even though the system is not expected to turn into a tropical storm, it could be a wet prelude to what is expected to be a busy hurricane season, which began June 1.\n\nWith another 5 inches of rain possible before Friday night, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for five South Florida Counties late on Wednesday. Media reports and social media posts showed cars stalled and people wading in hip-deep waters flooding streets. Parts of Interstate 95, a main north-south route along the East Coast, were closed due to flooding on Wednesday.\n\n\"The problem is that there is no place for the rain to go,\" said Oravec. \"The ground is so saturated. In some places water is rising up from the sewers.\" Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a city-wide emergency due to flooding. He said the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission was sending boats and high-water vehicles to assist any rescues if needed.\n\nTrantalis urged people to stay off roadways. \"It's crucial to never attempt to drive through high water,\" he warned in a message on the X social media platform. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also declared states of emergency, freeing up money and resources to better cope with the storm and its aftermath.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

From 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., both counties have an 80% to 90% chance of rain.\n\nThe areas predicted to be most affected are those that have already experienced severe flash flooding -- southern Broward, northern Miami-Dade and packed metro areas.\n\n\"Unfortunately, those are the areas that were hit hardest,\" Rizzuto said. \"It could be a bit dicey, the hardest hit areas will be hit again.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'We're prepared for the worst': South Floridians weather 'rare' flash flood emergency\n\nThe same regions are currently under a flood warning and watch. The warning concludes at 8 a.m. Thursday; the watch lasts until Friday evening.\n\nRegarding flash flooding warnings or another rare emergency situation, Rizzuto said it would not take much for one to be issued, given the amount of water still on the ground.\n\n\"It's not going to take much rainfall to warrant a flash flood,\" he said.\n\nThe official total of rain on Wednesday has not been tallied. However, the weather service reported between 5 and 13 inches of rain fell in both counties as of late Wednesday.\n\nFlorida, Miami-Dade County, Broward County and several cities -- namely Miami and Fort Lauderdale -- have already issued a state of emergency, which is meant to aid recovery efforts but will also help if weather continues to be severe.\n\nREAD MORE: Rainfall deluge shutting down Miami and Ft.

And on Thursday more rain is on the way, likely pushing losses over $1 billion.\n\nIn the worst case as much as 4 to 6 inches of rain may fall on soaked ground across southern Florida, leading to more flooding, said Sammy Hadi, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Miami. There may be isolated spots that get even more.\n\nOn Wednesday, 9.54 inches fell in Fort Lauderdale, the most ever for a June day. The downpour closed ramps to the airport and flooded city streets. The wider deluge led parts of Interstate-95 to be closed, hundreds of flights to be canceled and Governor Ron DeSantis to declare an emergency in several counties including Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier, Lee and Sarasota.\n\nThe rain fell so hard and fast that it forced the weather service to issue its second-ever emergency flood warning for southern Florida's east coast, Hadi said. The National Hurricane Center is tracking the system responsible, but says it has not yet reached the level of a tropical storm.\n\n\"Regardless of whether it has a name or not, if it drops 9 inches in 24 hours there are going to be big problems,\" Hadi said.\n\nDamages are likely to top out at $1 billion or more, said Chuck Watson, a disaster modeler with Enki Research. That said, given the rising cost of homes and automobiles, storms are causing that scale of destruction more often.\n\nParallels are already being drawn to an April 2023 event that also flooded the Fort Lauderdale region and cost at least $1.1 billion in losses. It closed the city's airport and brought more than 25 inches of rain in 24 hours, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nThe ocean around Florida is at a record warmth in some areas and the atmosphere is holding tremendous amounts of water vapor. In Miami on Wednesday, measurements recorded the second highest amount of moisture in the air for a June day, according to a Substack post by Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG-TV in Miami and former US National Hurricane Center scientist.\n\n\"With plenty of heat at hand, and so much water vapor, it didn't take much of a disturbance to trigger heavy rains,\" said Bob Henson, a meteorologist and author with Yale Climate Connections. \"Getting two events in less than 15 months should be wake-up call for anyone who's been dozing through the overlapping insurance and climate crises in South Florida.\"\n\nWith more rain on the way, 246 flights have already been canceled in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and other Florida airports, according to FlightAware, an airline tracking service.", "source": {"uri": "claimsjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Claims Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

While the situation appears to be stabilizing at the moment, citizens should not underestimate the risks of flash floods.\n\nCitizens should avoid entering floodwaters on foot or in vehicles. The NWS warns drivers that 12 inches of water can easily sweep a car off the road. An additional 4-8 inches of rainfall today could push already flooded roads into double digits.\n\nTotal Traffic Miami reported on X (formerly Twitter) that the portion of I-95 closed after yesterday's heavy rainfall has reopened but is at risk of closing again if water levels rise. Newsweek reached out to Miami Highway Patrol for verification.\n\nThe NWS is currently unable to predict which exact areas will be most affected in the next two days. Flash floods are still occurring across portions of Collier, Miami-Dade, and Broward counties. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava have declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County and neighboring counties. The state of emergency is expected to last seven days but could be terminated early if the situation improves.\n\nHeavy rainfall is hitting Florida at the beginning of hurricane season. The NWS Miami branch reported that they cannot rule out a possible tornado in southern Florida and advise citizens to be prepared to shelter.\n\nMeteorologists say another rainfall is expected to start later in the morning on Thursday and could continue throughout Friday and Saturday. Some roads will remain closed until the water drains. The storms are not expected to reach cyclone level. The National Hurricane Center evaluated the risk at 20 percent, which is considered low.\n\nNBC reported severe disruptions at both Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, with almost 200 canceled flights. Severe flooding also affected trains to and from Miami, suspending service between Miami and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nEarly next week, the National Hurricane Center expects a tropical storm to form in the Gulf of Mexico.

No injuries were reported.\n\nRecord rainfall wreaks havoc: South Florida experiences \"life threatening\" flooding, stalled cars, delayed flights\n\nThe highest rainfall amounts in Palm Beach County from early Tuesday through Thursday morning were measured northeast of Lion Country Safari in Loxahatchee with 9.5 inches tallied by the NWS.\n\nOther areas with high rainfall included Boca Raton (7.65 inches), Delray Beach (6.86 inches), Lantana (6.25 inches), Wellington (5.93 inches), West Palm Beach (5.09 inches), Lake Worth (5.04 inches), Jupiter (4.81 inches) and Palm Beach Gardens (4.49 inches).\n\nIn Broward County, the highest rainfall was in Hallandale Beach, where 19.39 inches of rain fell in about a 48-hour period through early Thursday.\n\n\"In this situation, conditions may deteriorate quickly,\" said NWS Miami meteorologist Tony Reynes on Thursday. \"There may be some sunshine this morning but it can change. We want to keep a very close eye on the vulnerable areas over the next 24 hours.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was open Thursday morning but travelers were asked to check with their airlines for flight updates.\n\n\"Our terminal and airport exit roadways are clear,\" the airport said on social media, noting, however, that a section of East Perimeter Road was closed because of flooding.\n\nThe heavy rainfall and flooding triggered a state of emergency declaration by Gov. Ron DeSantis for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties. DeSantis also ordered the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard activated \"as needed.\"\n\nThe declaration frees agencies from red tape in responding to the emergency and allows local governments to access money in the state's Emergency Preparedness and Response Fund.\n\n2024 hurricane season: 5 tips to stay sane and safe in face of frightful forecast\n\nThrough Thursday morning, State Farm reported it had already received about 300 auto claims associated with the torrential downpours.\n\nFOX Weather hurricane specialist Bryan Norcross likened the weather pattern over Florida to the atmospheric rivers that are common along the west coast of the United States.\n\n\"It's a relatively narrow band of moisture squeezed between two competing weather systems,\" Norcross said in his Hurricane Intel blog. \"The warmer-than-normal waters to the south are undoubtedly enhancing the amount of moisture flowing over South Florida.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is watching two areas for potential tropical development. An area of low pressure that is helping pull moisture into the state is now in the Atlantic Ocean off the east coast of Florida. It has a 20% chance of becoming a named storm over the next two days.\n\nA second area of low pressure in the Bay of Campeche is expected to form this weekend or early next week and has a 40% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe first two names on the 2024 hurricane list are Alberto and Beryl.\n\nAt this point, AccuWeather lead hurricane forecaster Alex DaSilva said he doesn't expect the spot in the Bay of Campeche to impact Florida. He said it's more likely going to cause heavy rain in Mexico and possibly in Texas as far north as Houston.\n\nDaSilva said in addition to record warm sea surface temperatures, the depth of the ocean heat in the Gulf of Mexico is concerning. When water is deeply warm, it means a tropical cyclone won't churn up cooler water from below which can limit its growth.\n\n\"In the western Caribbean, there are areas right now where the 80-degree temperature line extends as deep as 300 to 400 feet below the surface,\" DaSilva said. \"That is something we would expect to see in August.\"\n\nTropical cyclones generally need water temperatures of 80 degrees or higher to form.\n\nKimberly Miller is a journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

Catastrophic damage possible", "body": "MIAMI -- Life-threatening rainfall pummeling South Florida that's closed I-95 and caused major delays at the region's two largest airports Wednesday is now being considered a flash flood emergency -- an \"exceedingly rare\" circumstance classified by forecasters when catastrophic damage is imminent.\n\nAround 3:40 p.m., the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for portions of southern Broward County and northern Miami-Dade County. The emergency is in effect until 8:00 pm.\n\nCities under the emergency advisory are: Miami Gardens, North Miami Beach, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar and Dania Beach. Other urban city centers in both counties will see the greatest threat of flash flooding.\n\nForecasters say they've received \"nonstop\" reports of flash flooding. The NWS has six flash flood warnings in effect throughout the region.\n\nResidents are being told not to drive in the emergency area and to seek higher ground until flood waters recede.\n\nSo far this week, parts of South Florida have seen up to 10 inches of rain. The deluge on Wednesday forced the closure of Interstate 95 due to flash flooding and hours-long delays at both Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nWhat is a flash flood emergency?\n\nA flash flood emergency is the most severe weather category for flooding. An emergency is only issued in exceedingly rare situations when extremely heavy rain is leading to a severe threat to life and catastrophic damage, the weather service said.\n\nLuke Culver, a meteorologist at NWS Miami, said the emergency \"is really for extremely rare situations where there are dangers to life and property.\"\n\n\"When we go to an emergency, we have people getting rescued from vehicles and particularly dangerous and life-threatening situations,\" he said.\n\nJohn Morales, a consulting meteorologist, said on X that the first flash flood emergency issued by National Weather Service Miami was for a record-breaking rainstorm in the Fort Lauderdale area in April 2023.\n\nAt the time, 31 inches of rain in more than three days and 26 inches in one day transformed the Fort Lauderdale airport into a waterway.\n\nNorth of the airport, in the Edgewood area that had just received bigger pipes as part of a project to better deal with flooding, water levels rose to near waist-deep levels, pushing into homes.\n\n(Miami Herald reporter David J.

Ron DeSantis has declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties after dangerous flooding immobilized the operations of critical infrastructure on Wednesday, including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.\n\nFlood warnings are in place for cities including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples until Thursday morning, where between 4 and 13 inches of rainfall fell across the region Wednesday. Additional rainfall up to 2 inches possible in the area.\n\nFlood watches are in effect through Friday evening across Southern Florida, where more rounds of heavy rainfall are expected.\n\nSevere flooding in Hallandale Beach submerged cars up to their windshields in some places, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety.\n\nA family lost their young son during the storm Wednesday, but were later reunited with the help of police who found the child, Hallandale Beach officials said.\n\nResident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her.\n\n\"If I was to open my car door, I would've just had a ton of water rushing in. I would've been out of luck big time,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nAfter hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said.\n\nSeveral local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Floriday Department of Highway Safety said.\n\nA member of the City of Hollywood SWAT team looks for people who may need help being evacuated.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nFort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received more than a month's worth of rain Wednesday with 9.58 inches - eclipsing its average June rainfall of 9.55 inches.\n\nMiami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are only expected to continue through the end of the workweek.\n\nIn Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018.\n\nMany South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday.\n\nAnna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we're ready to go,\" Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nFlooding risk grows by the day\n\nConsiderable flooding is possible across the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday and Friday as a broad swath of storms pass over the state.\n\nFlood watches are in effect for over 8 million people across the region through Thursday night, with some watches across the greater Miami area lasting into Friday.\n\nParts of the state are likely to see double-digit rainfall totals by the time all is said and done. Totals of 10 inches or more are most likely across the southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park.\n\nThe flood risk will grow through the week as storms unleash torrential downpours over the same area each day, soaking the soil and overwhelming waterways.\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain will be beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nHow a giant gyre of moisture brings tropical trouble\n\nThe robust moisture fueling this week's storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters.\n\nThe gyre's broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors - including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water - align.\n\nThe gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US.\n\nDespite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida.\n\nWhat the gyre is doing is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week.\n\n\"Just the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\" told CNN.\n\nJune, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida. Frequent surges of deep, tropical moisture and the direct impact of tropical systems send rainfall totals skyrocketing during this part of the year.\n\nCNN's Sara Smart and Jamiel Lynch contributed to

Huriash, Shira Moolten, Susannah Bryan and David Lyons - South Florida Sun-Sentinel (TNS)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- South Floridians were warned to stay indoors and off roads as heavy downpours struck the region Wednesday afternoon, bringing \"life-threatening flooding\" reminiscent of a devastating storm in April 2023.\n\nEmergency responders in Broward were inundated with flood-related phone calls from stranded cars to downed power lines and water entering businesses and homes. The rain also led to delayed flights, and part of Interstate 95 was closed.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare flash flood emergency due to \"life-threatening flooding\" as heavy rainfall continued to fall in already flooded areas. It was canceled about 8 p.m. Wednesday. The last time the same warning was issued was in April 2023.\n\n\"If you don't have to travel, please don't,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Garcia said.\n\nThe \"impactful flooding\" won't be over so quick. Thursday \"we're still under threat,\" Garcia said. \"We might not be out of this heavy pattern for several days more.\"\n\nA flood watch is in effect for all of South Florida through Thursday evening. Periods of widespread showers and thunderstorms with heavy rainfall will lead to the potential for localized flash flooding, warned the National Weather Service.\n\nFrom midnight to 6 p.m. Wednesday, between 10 to 15 inches rain inundated the areas of Hallandale Beach, Hollywood and Aventura, the weather service said. In Fort Lauderdale, between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell between midnight and 6 p.m. Wednesday. Several more inches of rain were possible overnight, the weather service said.\n\nRadar shows \"storm after storm,\" conditions ripe for rain as a weather system continued to move across the state.\n\nFort Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood and Dania Beach declared states of emergency Wednesday evening, so they can receive resources, money and equipment from the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, as well as Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the west coast.\n\nCars stranded, flight delays\n\nCars were stuck in flooded roadways in parts of Broward County, including Hallandale Beach and in Hollywood.\n\nTraffic on I-95 was being diverted at Oakland Park Boulevard, with drivers reentering the highway at Stirling Road.\n\nBroward Sheriff Fire Rescue had responded to at least a dozen weather-related calls since the rain began to ramp up about 11 a.m. Wednesday morning, Battalion Chief Michael Kane said Wednesday afternoon. As he spoke, he continued to get alerts, mostly centered in the areas of Dania Beach and Hallandale Beach.\n\n\"They're just pouring in,\" Kane said.\n\nAs of 2:30 p.m., Kane said firefighters were in the middle of responding to calls about downed power lines, flooding coming through the air conditioning system at Crate & Barrel in Dania Beach, and flooding at a multifamily building.\n\nThe ground is so saturated with water from the previous days that more rain is quickly causing flooding, Kane said.\n\nSeveral agencies reminded drivers not to call 911 if their cars are simply stranded but their lives are not in danger.\n\nMeanwhile, flight delays at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport lasted for hours as multiple storm systems dramatically slowed air operations.\n\nAlthough travelers were able to fly out of the airport, it took an average wait in some instances of a little more than 7 hours to do so, according to FAA time estimates.\n\nBut both of the airport's runways remained operational and were handling flights Wednesday, said airport spokeswoman Arlene Satchell in an email Wednesday. She added that it was \"not accurate\" to conclude that runway flooding contributed to flight disruptions.\n\n\"The bad weather in our area has triggered a few FAA traffic management initiatives (ground stops, ground delays) for airports in South Florida today, primarily for FLL and (Miami International Airport,)\" she said. \"Our airport is currently in ground delay status for arrivals per the FAA. While there are some flooded areas on the airfield ... both runways are operational and handling flight activity.\"\n\nAt the Fort Lauderdale airport there were 70 flight delays and 144 cancellations, airport officials confirmed as of midafternoon, although not all were directly related to the weather. Satchell said at the time that the numbers were expected to climb.\n\nMiami International Airport had 365 delays and 175 cancellations and lengthy departure delays of up to three hours. Inbound flights were delayed at their originating airports by an average of 4 hours and 59 minutes.\n\nPalm Beach International Airport had 47 delays and 35 cancellations. There was no immediate information on the length of delays.\n\nSouth Florida's passenger rail services were also disrupted in Miami-Dade County as storm waters covered a portion of the Florida East Coast Railway tracks between Aventura and Miami used by the high-speed Brightline service.\n\nPassengers reported being transported by bus after southbound trains stopped at the Aventura station just south of the Broward-Miami-Dade county line.\n\nBrightline spokesman Ben Porrit said by email late Wednesday afternoon that maintenance crews were \"working on this now.\"\n\nHe said it was \"likely that we will suspend service between Aventura and Miami but run the rest of the system as normal.\"\n\nThe disruption had a ripple effect on Tri-Rail's new cross-county service between its corridor west of I-95 and the Miami-Central station downtown. Spokesman Victor Garcia said Tri-Rail passengers were being advised to transfer to the Metro-Rail system to reach downtown Wednesday evening.\n\nHe said flooded roads around Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport caused delays of Tri-Rail shuttle buses between the rail line's Griffin Road station and airport terminals.\n\nOther than those episodes, Tri-Rail trains continued to run between its northernmost station at Mangonia Park in Palm Beach County through Broward and into Miami International Airport, he said.\n\n'Here it is again'\n\nFor residents still recovering from the devastating April floods, Wednesday's rain came as a surprise and an unpleasant reminder of what they endured just over a year ago.\n\nBob Thomas, 67, runs a halfway house near the Edgewood neighborhood that got hit particularly hard in that storm. The water was already at his front gate Wednesday afternoon, about 6 feet from the building, and creeping up.\n\n\"It brings back memories, that's for sure,\" he said when asked about how it felt compared to the April flooding.\n\nThen, the downpour filled the house with three feet of water. It took Thomas five months to repair the damage the flooding left and he still isn't entirely done. Everyone in the home had to evacuate. Now, he wonders when he should tell them it's time to put their belongings up high and even evacuate again.\n\n\"If it continues for six more hours, we'll be underwater,\" he said.\n\nJoe Martinez, 34, lost his car in last year's storm. On Wednesday, he chose to park at a McDonald's and walk the rest of the way with a 12-pack, wading through waist-deep water.\n\nBy late afternoon, it was already impossible to get into his neighborhood in the Riverland area of Fort Lauderdale, one of the areas that was hit hardest last year.\n\n\"I got within two inches of having water in my door last year,\" Martinez said, anxious because the rain has shown no sign of letting up. The canals are already overflowing, and \"the water doesn't have anywhere to go.\"\n\nMartinez had never seen anything like last year's April flood, what he thought was a once in a thousand year event, and now it appears to have happened a second time. He had no good explanation.\n\nTed Inserra, president of the River Oaks Civic Association, urged the city to send in more temporary pumps to help prevent flooding.\n\n\"Water approaching front doors, messaged everyone, on hold from the 828-8000 number, in the 900 block of 19th street, we just got our power back on,\" Inserra said. \"We knew this was coming!!\"\n\nFort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said \"an army of pump trucks\" were in place throughout the city to help prevent flooding. \"The problem is they don't have any place to dump the water,\" he said. \"So they have to hold it.\"\n\nAfter driving through River Oaks and nearby Citrus Isles neighborhoods, Trantalis was stunned by all the flooded streets.\n\n\"River Oaks is heavily flooded,\" he said. \"Cars are still passing, but most streets have at least 6 to 8 inches of water. Some homes are seeing water intrusion. Citrus Isles is heavily flooded with intrusion into many, many homes.\"\n\nHollywood offered residents free parking in downtown garages until 8 p.m. Friday. Hopefully they won't need to extend it beyond that, Hussey said, adding that the situation is similar to April so far.\n\n\"I'm anticipating the worst and I'm hoping for the best that that is not the case, but right now the amount of rain is very similar to what we saw for that April storm,\" she said.\n\nMany described the flooding back in April as a rare, catastrophic event, but Wednesday's rain has left some reconsidering.\n\n\"Last year they called that the storm of the century,\" Thomas said. \"Now here it is again and I'm sitting here looking at the radar and I don't really see an end to it.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale canceled all board meetings scheduled for Wednesday night. All Parks and Recreation programming was also canceled.\n\nOther events in the county also were being canceled, including Wednesday night's Cricket Watch Party for West Indies v. New Zealand, an event tied to the cricket World Cup at Central Broward Park in Lauderhill. Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach canceled horse racing on Thursday. A performance at the Broward Center for Performing Arts was canceled. Broward College and Nova Southeastern University canceled Wednesday night classes.\n\n\u00a92024 South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

The threat still isn't over", "body": "(CNN) -- Heavy rainfall could swamp South Florida for a third day in a row on Thursday, threatening more destructive flooding after Wednesday's storms transformed roads into canals and seeped into homes - and more is yet to come later this week.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade and Sarasota counties after dangerous flooding immobilized the operations of critical infrastructure on Wednesday, including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.\n\nFlood warnings are in place for cities including Fort Lauderdale, Miami and Naples until Thursday morning, where between 4 and 13 inches of rainfall fell across the region Wednesday. Additional rainfall up to 2 inches possible in the area.\n\nFlood watches are in effect through Friday evening across Southern Florida, where more rounds of heavy rainfall are expected.\n\nSevere flooding in Hallandale Beach submerged cars up to their windshields in some places, forcing some drivers to abandon their stalled-out vehicles and wade to safety.\n\nA family lost their young son during the storm Wednesday, but were later reunited with the help of police who found the child, Hallandale Beach officials said.\n\nResident Kait Madrigal spent five hours stuck in her car Wednesday after it became suddenly surrounded by floodwaters on her way to work near Hollywood, Florida, she told CNN. She was able to park on the sidewalk to get to higher ground but began to panic as the water rose and cars began to stall out around her.\n\n\"If I was to open my car door, I would've just had a ton of water rushing in. I would've been out of luck big time,\" the 25-year-old said.\n\nAfter hours of unrelenting rain, Madrigal waded through the water and was able to find a possible exit route. Fearing she may become trapped all night, she drove out and was able to get home safely, she said.\n\nSeveral local officials have warned against trying to drive through murky floodwaters and are urging storm-weary South Floridians to stay home. Most flood-related drownings occur when cars unknowingly drive into deep water, the Floriday Department of Highway Safety said.\n\nFort Lauderdale, where the mayor declared a local state of emergency, received more than a month's worth of rain Wednesday with 9.58 inches - eclipsing its average June rainfall of 9.55 inches.\n\nMiami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport led the nation with the most flights canceled or delayed Wednesday, with more than 1,200 disruptions. The air travel woes are only expected to continue through the end of the workweek.\n\nIn Broward County, the severe storms prompted school officials to postpone the demolition of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School building where a gunman killed 17 people in 2018.\n\nMany South Florida residents had only just finished repairing their homes after catastrophic flooding in April 2023, only to find water lapping at their doorsteps Wednesday.\n\nAnna Rysedorph, a resident of the Broward County neighborhood of Edgewood, prepared for the worst as water circled her ankles in her home.\n\n\"I put the dogs in, I'm all packed up. I pretty much got everything in bins and we're ready to go,\" Edgewood resident Anna Rysedorph told CNN affiliate WSVN Wednesday. \"My husband's like 'Don't panic, don't panic,' but you know, I'm not gonna be caught unprepared.\"\n\nFlooding risk grows by the day\n\nConsiderable flooding is possible across the southern Florida Peninsula on Thursday and Friday as a broad swath of storms pass over the state.\n\nFlood watches are in effect for over 8 million people across the region through Thursday night, with some watches across the greater Miami area lasting into Friday.\n\nParts of the state are likely to see double-digit rainfall totals by the time all is said and done. Totals of 10 inches or more are most likely across the southwestern Gulf Coast of the state, from Sarasota to Everglades National Park.\n\nThe flood risk will grow through the week as storms unleash torrential downpours over the same area each day, soaking the soil and overwhelming waterways.\n\nWhile the state is no stranger to drenching rain, heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution. The daily downpours are also being fueled by a firehose of tropical moisture from parts of the Caribbean funneling straight into South Florida along a front draped over the state.\n\nIf there's any silver lining, it's the rain will be beneficial to areas suffering through drought. Half of Florida is experiencing abnormal dryness or drought conditions, with the worst drought centered in the bull's-eye for the heaviest rain, according to the US Drought Monitor.\n\nHow a giant gyre of moisture brings tropical trouble\n\nThe robust moisture fueling this week's storms typically pools over parts of the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico at this point in the season into the Central American gyre: A large, disorganized area of showers and thunderstorms that rotates over Central America and its surrounding waters.\n\nThe gyre's broad spin and deep moisture can help tropical systems form in parts of the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico and even the extreme eastern Pacific when other necessary factors - including favorable upper-level winds and warm ocean water - align.\n\nThe gyre typically first develops around the late spring and early summer, which is one reason most June tropical systems form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the East Coast of the US.\n\nDespite plenty of bathtub warm water in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, upper-level winds, known as wind shear, are much too disruptive right now for any tropical systems to form in these areas, according to Jon Rizzo, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Key West, Florida.\n\nWhat the gyre is doing is juicing up the wet weather across the Gulf Coast, like what Florida will endure this week.\n\n\"Just the mere presence of the Central American gyre forming tells us that summer is here and the rainy season is about to begin,\" told CNN.\n\nJune, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida. Frequent surges of deep, tropical moisture and the direct impact of tropical systems send rainfall totals skyrocketing during this part of the year.\n\nCNN's Sara Smart and Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Huriash, Shira Moolten, Susannah Bryan and David Lyons, South Florida Sun-Sentinel The Tribune Content Agency\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. - South Floridians were warned to stay indoors and off roads as heavy downpours struck the region Wednesday afternoon, bringing \"life-threatening flooding\" reminiscent of a devastating storm in April 2023.\n\nEmergency responders in Broward were inundated with flood-related phone calls from stranded cars to downed power lines and water entering businesses and homes. The rain also led to delayed flights, and part of Interstate 95 was closed.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare flash flood emergency due to \"life-threatening flooding\" as heavy rainfall continued to fall in already flooded areas. It was canceled about 8 p.m. Wednesday. The last time the same warning was issued was in April 2023.\n\n\"If you don't have to travel, please don't,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Garcia said.\n\nThe \"impactful flooding\" won't be over so quick. Thursday \"we're still under threat,\" Garcia said. \"We might not be out of this heavy pattern for several days more.\"\n\nA flood watch is in effect for all of South Florida through Thursday evening. Periods of widespread showers and thunderstorms with heavy rainfall will lead to the potential for localized flash flooding, warned the National Weather Service.\n\nFrom midnight to 6 p.m. Wednesday, between 10 to 15 inches rain inundated the areas of Hallandale Beach, Hollywood and Aventura, the weather service said. In Fort Lauderdale, between 8 and 10 inches of rain fell between midnight and 6 p.m. Wednesday. Several more inches of rain were possible overnight, the weather service said.\n\nRadar shows \"storm after storm,\" conditions ripe for rain as a weather system continued to move across the state.\n\nFort Lauderdale, Hallandale Beach, Hollywood and Dania Beach declared states of emergency Wednesday evening, so they can receive resources, money and equipment from the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, as well as Collier, Lee and Sarasota counties on the west coast.\n\nTraffic on I-95 was being diverted at Oakland Park Boulevard, with drivers reentering the highway at Stirling Road.\n\nBroward Sheriff Fire Rescue had responded to at least a dozen weather-related calls since the rain began to ramp up about 11 a.m. Wednesday morning, Battalion Chief Michael Kane said Wednesday afternoon. As he spoke, he continued to get alerts, mostly centered in the areas of Dania Beach and Hallandale Beach.\n\n\"They're just pouring in,\" Kane said.\n\nAs of 2:30 p.m., Kane said firefighters were in the middle of responding to calls about downed power lines, flooding coming through the air conditioning system at Crate & Barrel in Dania Beach, and flooding at a multifamily building.\n\nThe ground is so saturated with water from the previous days that more rain is quickly causing flooding, Kane said.\n\nSeveral agencies reminded drivers not to call 911 if their cars are simply stranded but their lives are not in danger.\n\nMeanwhile, flight delays at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport lasted for hours as multiple storm systems dramatically slowed air operations.\n\nAlthough travelers were able to fly out of the airport, it took an average wait in some instances of a little more than 7 hours to do so, according to FAA time estimates.\n\nBut both of the airport's runways remained operational and were handling flights Wednesday, said airport spokeswoman Arlene Satchell in an email Wednesday. She added that it was \"not accurate\" to conclude that runway flooding contributed to flight disruptions.\n\n\"The bad weather in our area has triggered a few FAA traffic management initiatives (ground stops, ground delays) for airports in South Florida today, primarily for FLL and (Miami International Airport,)\" she said. \"Our airport is currently in ground delay status for arrivals per the FAA. While there are some flooded areas on the airfield ... both runways are operational and handling flight activity.\"\n\nAt the Fort Lauderdale airport there were 70 flight delays and 144 cancellations, airport officials confirmed as of midafternoon, although not all were directly related to the weather. Satchell said at the time that the numbers were expected to climb.\n\nMiami International Airport had 365 delays and 175 cancellations and lengthy departure delays of up to three hours. Inbound flights were delayed at their originating airports by an average of 4 hours and 59 minutes.\n\nPalm Beach International Airport had 47 delays and 35 cancellations. There was no immediate information on the length of delays.\n\nSouth Florida's passenger rail services were also disrupted in Miami-Dade County as storm waters covered a portion of the Florida East Coast Railway tracks between Aventura and Miami used by the high-speed Brightline service.\n\nPassengers reported being transported by bus after southbound trains stopped at the Aventura station just south of the Broward-Miami-Dade county line.\n\nBrightline spokesman Ben Porrit said by email late Wednesday afternoon that maintenance crews were \"working on this now.\"\n\nHe said it was \"likely that we will suspend service between Aventura and Miami but run the rest of the system as normal.\"\n\nThe disruption had a ripple effect on Tri-Rail's new cross-county service between its corridor west of I-95 and the Miami-Central station downtown. Spokesman Victor Garcia said Tri-Rail passengers were being advised to transfer to the Metro-Rail system to reach downtown Wednesday evening.\n\nHe said flooded roads around Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport caused delays of Tri-Rail shuttle buses between the rail line's Griffin Road station and airport terminals.\n\nOther than those episodes, Tri-Rail trains continued to run between its northernmost station at Mangonia Park in Palm Beach County through Broward and into Miami International Airport, he said.\n\n'Here it is again'\n\nFor residents still recovering from the devastating April floods, Wednesday's rain came as a surprise and an unpleasant reminder of what they endured just over a year ago.\n\nBob Thomas, 67, runs a halfway house near the Edgewood neighborhood that got hit particularly hard in that storm. The water was already at his front gate Wednesday afternoon, about 6 feet from the building, and creeping up.\n\n\"It brings back memories, that's for sure,\" he said when asked about how it felt compared to the April flooding.\n\nThen, the downpour filled the house with three feet of water. It took Thomas five months to repair the damage the flooding left and he still isn't entirely done. Everyone in the home had to evacuate. Now, he wonders when he should tell them it's time to put their belongings up high and even evacuate again.\n\n\"If it continues for six more hours, we'll be underwater,\" he said.\n\nJoe Martinez, 34, lost his car in last year's storm. On Wednesday, he chose to park at a McDonald's and walk the rest of the way with a 12-pack, wading through waist-deep water.\n\nBy late afternoon, it was already impossible to get into his neighborhood in the Riverland area of Fort Lauderdale, one of the areas that was hit hardest last year.\n\n\"I got within two inches of having water in my door last year,\" Martinez said, anxious because the rain has shown no sign of letting up. The canals are already overflowing, and \"the water doesn't have anywhere to go.\"\n\nMartinez had never seen anything like last year's April flood, what he thought was a once in a thousand year event, and now it appears to have happened a second time. He had no good explanation.\n\nTed Inserra, president of the River Oaks Civic Association, urged the city to send in more temporary pumps to help prevent flooding.\n\n\"Water approaching front doors, messaged everyone, on hold from the 828-8000 number, in the 900 block of 19th street, we just got our power back on,\" Inserra said. \"We knew this was coming!!\"\n\nFort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said \"an army of pump trucks\" were in place throughout the city to help prevent flooding. \"The problem is they don't have any place to dump the water,\" he said. \"So they have to hold it.\"\n\nAfter driving through River Oaks and nearby Citrus Isles neighborhoods, Trantalis was stunned by all the flooded streets.\n\n\"River Oaks is heavily flooded,\" he said. \"Cars are still passing, but most streets have at least 6 to 8 inches of water. Some homes are seeing water intrusion. Citrus Isles is heavily flooded with intrusion into many, many homes.\"\n\nHollywood offered residents free parking in downtown garages until 8 p.m. Friday. Hopefully they won't need to extend it beyond that, Hussey said, adding that the situation is similar to April so far.\n\n\"I'm anticipating the worst and I'm hoping for the best that that is not the case, but right now the amount of rain is very similar to what we saw for that April storm,\" she said.\n\nMany described the flooding back in April as a rare, catastrophic event, but Wednesday's rain has left some reconsidering.\n\n\"Last year they called that the storm of the century,\" Thomas said. \"Now here it is again and I'm sitting here looking at the radar and I don't really see an end to it.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale canceled all board meetings scheduled for Wednesday night. All Parks and Recreation programming was also canceled.\n\nOther events in the county also were being canceled, including Wednesday night's Cricket Watch Party for West Indies v. New Zealand, an event tied to the cricket World Cup at Central Broward Park in Lauderhill. Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach canceled horse racing on Thursday. A performance at the Broward Center for Performing Arts was canceled. Broward College and Nova Southeastern University canceled Wednesday night classes.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It's limited to five bags per resident and they must provide proof of residency. They will be available until the supply runs out.\n\nSandbags will be available at 11 a.m. at North Miami's public works facility at 1855 NE 142nd Street.

The water was up to here (motioning to his hips). I'm not kidding you. And there are a couple of cars stranded by the entrance. I'm freaking out because yesterday I was like how do I get around here, this is crazy, I don't know how long this is going to going on for,\" he said.\n\nIn Hollywood, more than a dozen cars stalled out in knee-deep flood water on N 14th Avenue off Sheridan Street. A pump on the street was unable to keep up with the rain.\n\nA flood warning is in effect for much of Miami-Dade and Broward through 8 a.m. Thursday. A flood watch is in effect through Friday at 8 p.m.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include Miami, Hialeah, Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar, Pompano Beach, Davie, Miami Beach, Plantation, Sunrise, Tamarac, Margate, Coral Gables, Key Biscayne, South Miami, Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Surfside, Miami Gardens and Hallandale Beach, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe wet, stormy weather pattern will hold in South Florida through the end of the work week, forecasters say, with the tropical moisture dissipating slightly by the weekend.

Since midnight, Miami Beach has recorded 6.95 inches of rainfall, while Hallandale has seen 6.01 inches. Other notable totals include 5.02 inches in Miami Shores, 4.41 inches in North Miami, and 3.82 inches in Hollywood.\n\nThe relentless downpour has put immense pressure on the drainage systems.\n\nIn Miami, floodwaters surged through Brickell Avenue and Southeast 14th Street, causing cars to create large wakes. The rushing water flowed down South Miami Avenue, affecting businesses such as Paperfish and Sexy Fish, with sidewalks submerged.\n\nA manhole cover was pushed up by the force of the water on Brickell Bay Drive, and another near the Brightline station in Downtown Miami experienced similar issues.\n\n\"Some of the flooding is pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie,\" said Ethan, a local resident caught in the rain with friends, who chose to brave the weather for an unusual evening activity.\n\nIn Miami Beach, the streets were heavily flooded, with areas like 71st Street, Harding Avenue, Alton Road, and 46th Street becoming impassable. One resident described seeing Corvettes almost underwater, estimating thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nSeattle native, John Martin is visiting for a cruise and he says maneuvering the local streets weren't easy, but he also faced some challenges at the airport.\n\n\"Yea this is crazy, I spent a lot of my life in Seattle, but we don't get flooding like this\", said Martin. \"Getting here was quiet difficult, so yesterday our flight was delayed four hours.\"\n\nBusinesses in Miami Beach are facing significant cleanup costs as floodwaters continue to seep in. Sheets of rain have reduced visibility from high-rises and slowed traffic on Interstate 95 near the 836 interchange, despite pumps working in overdrive to manage the water.\n\n\"It's a little annoying, but I mean, we will deal with it,\" another resident commented on the ongoing challenges.\n\nIn Hallandale, six inches of rain on Tuesday led to the temporary closure of Hallandale Beach Boulevard due to severe flooding. Although the avenue has since reopened, the forecast suggests more rain is on the way for South Florida residents.\n\nCommunities across South Florida are experiencing similar conditions. In Surfside, water gushed into a residential parking garage on 92nd Street and Collins Avenue.\n\nOpa-locka saw residential streets flooded, with even a Brinks truck struggling through deep puddles. Hialeah's mobile home community on West 29th Street was inundated, and residents had to navigate significant flooding.\n\nDania Beach and Hollywood also reported heavy flooding, with rain pouring down on the Turnpike and causing traffic issues on I-95 during rush hour.\n\nBroward County officials have proactively prepared for the continued rainfall by clearing debris from storm drains to facilitate water flow.\n\n\"We know this whole week and probably on through next week, based on the forecast, we're going to experience a lot of rain,\" one official stated.\n\nCounty cruise are working around the clock monitoring the drains in flood prone areas.\n\n\"We are going to different locations throughout the county that we know are prone to flooding,\" said the official.\n\nTeams have been dispatched to flood-prone locations to mitigate the impact.\n\nAir travel in and out of South Florida is also affected by the heavy rainfalls. Planes are seen pilled up on the runway of Fort Lauderdale International Airport causing flight delays for nearly an hour and a half.\n\nAccording to Flight Aware incoming planes to FLL are being held and diverted.\n\nTravelers are strongly advised to confirm their flights with their airlines before heading to either airport.\n\nAs South Florida continues to cope with the adverse weather, residents are urged to stay safe and remain informed about the inclement weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

The flood watches were extended until Friday evening.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared an emergency for Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties, writing that the heavy rain and floods have affected the \"operational capability of critical infrastructure,\" including major interstates, roadways, schools and airports.\n\nOfficials warned on Wednesday, \"Many areas are inundated with water w/ stalled cars & more rainfall is on the way.\" They added, \"Stay off the roadways if possible.\"\n\nOver 600 flight cancellations and delays across two of the region's main airports were reported. At least 334 flights in and out of Miami International Airport were canceled and there were more than 287 flights canceled in and out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.\n\nThe spate of videos posted to social media showed motorists stranded in their cars, some with water levels reaching the vehicles' windows. Others could be seen wading though waist-high water, some carrying their belongings on their backs. In Miami, a city where flooding may occur on some streets even when it has not rained, videos showed stranded cars that were nearly entirely submerged under water.\n\nHallandale Beach was one of the worst hit. Footage showed one man kayaking among the stranded cars; a family lost their son during the storm, but were later reunited with the help of local police who were able to find the young boy; a woman who was driving to work said she spent five hours stuck in her car along Hallandale Beach Boulevard and US Route 1 that were choked with stranded and abandoned vehicles.\n\nOfficials urged residents to shelter in place and avoid driving or walking through the water.\n\nHollywood resident Kait Madrigal told CNN, \"The lights were out at multiple intersections and there were already cars that were stalled and abandoned. I've never seen it like that.\"\n\nAlong with the heavy rainfall, the storm system also brought an EF1 tornado on Wednesday to Hobe Sound, located in Martin County about 35 miles north of West Palm Beach, a National Weather Service damage survey confirmed.\n\nThe state received a month's worth of rain in one day. Fort Lauderdale saw a preliminary rainfall total of roughly 9.58 inches Wednesday, making it the city's eighth wettest day on record, according to data from the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Early afternoon is when everyone was let out early from work to get home before the rain started,\" Fort Lauderdale mayor Dean Trantalis told CNN. \"The streets were jammed. Instead of being flooded with water, they were flooded with cars.\"\n\nJune, July, August and September are generally the wettest months of the year for much of Florida, but heavy rain events are getting even heavier as the world warms due to fossil fuel pollution.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The city of Miami put their temporary and permanent pump stations to use to reduce the flooding and officials have made plans to hand out sandbags to local residents to reduce flood damage.\n\nThe NWS reported that the Florida Keys will remain under a flood watch until late Thursday. Miami Dade County, Glades, Palm Beach and Collier County, among tens of others, will remain under flood watch through Friday evening.\n\nRising water across cities have caused officials to temporarily close roads, and officials have urged residents to remain off the streets until the water secedes.\n\nAs additional rain bands pass through the state, the NWS has warned people that the rain could

Last year's flooding accompanied the rainiest day in Fort Lauderdale since records were kept, with 22.5 inches falling on April 12, 2023, according to a rainfall summary maintained by the National Weather Service.\n\nRainfall records get measured in different ways, including high points for a particular day and precipitation measured at individual rain stations over 24-hour periods.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Wednesday's 9.5 inches in Fort Lauderdale was the most for a June day and broke a daily record of 5.47 inches on June 12 that had stood since 1978. It also broke the overall June record of 8.6 inches set in 1930.\n\nMolleda said this week's rain fell hard enough and quickly enough to overwhelm drainage systems, swamp roads and generally lead to far more disruption than the typical summer downpour.\n\n\"It's not really about the amounts. It's about where the rainfall occurs and that area's ability to handle that amount of rainfall,\" he said during a Thursday press conference held by Miami-Dade County at its Doral emergency operations center. \"For example, yesterday we saw about 10 inches in about five hours. That's enough -- more than enough -- in those areas to cause flooding.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "douglas_hanks@miamiherald.com", "name": "Douglas Hanks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Everglades", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Port Everglades"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port Everglades"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swamp"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home_Recording", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Audio/Home Recording", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/wh08vg/picture289234514/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_Broward_Rain_MJO_25", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1556, "textEnd": 1563}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 1146, "textEnd": 1154}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Forecasters anticipate this could be a prelude to a busy hurricane season.\n\nMore torrential downpours deluged South Florida on Thursday, adding to more than a foot of rain that fell on parts of the state this week and leading forecasters to issue flood watches or warnings for an area where 8 million people reside. Some areas, including portions of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, are threatened with \"life-threatening flooding,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nA few spots have reported up to 18-to-25 inches of rain since Monday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

With another 5 inches of rain possible before Friday night, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for five South Florida Counties late on Wednesday.\n\nMedia reports and social media posts showed stalled cars and people wading in streets covered in hip-deep water, or paddling in small boats and kayaks. In some areas water has swamped lawns and pushed up to the front doors of houses and other buildings. Parts of Interstate 95, a main north-south route along the East Coast, were closed due to flooding on Wednesday.\n\n\"The problem is that there is no place for the rain to go,\" said Oravec. \"The ground is so saturated. In some places water is rising up from the sewers.\" The storm led officials to postpone the demolition of the building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida where 17 students and staff were killed in February 2018 in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.\n\nThe building, some parts still bloodstained, was closed immediately after the shooting and fenced off to preserve evidence. The demolition has been rescheduled for Friday. In nearby Fort Lauderdale, Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a city-wide emergency due to flooding. He said the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission was sending boats and high-water vehicles to assist any rescues if needed.\n\nTrantalis urged people to stay off roadways. \"It's crucial to never attempt to drive through high water,\" he warned in a message on the X social media platform. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also declared states of emergency, freeing up money and resources to better cope with the storm and its aftermath.\n\nHURRICANE FORECAST Forecasters are expecting eight to 13 hurricanes in the Atlantic this season, seven of which could build into major storms. Overall some 17 to 25 named tropical storms are expected.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces about 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes. In recent years, the frequency and intensity of hurricanes has increased linked to warming sea temperatures caused by higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\n(This story has not been edited

Since midnight, Miami Beach has recorded 6.95 inches of rainfall, while Hallandale has seen 6.01 inches. Other notable totals include 5.02 inches in Miami Shores, 4.41 inches in North Miami, and 3.82 inches in Hollywood.\n\nThe relentless downpour has put immense pressure on the drainage systems.\n\nIn Miami, floodwaters surged through Brickell Avenue and Southeast 14th Street, causing cars to create large wakes. The rushing water flowed down South Miami Avenue, affecting businesses such as Paperfish and Sexy Fish, with sidewalks submerged.\n\nA manhole cover was pushed up by the force of the water on Brickell Bay Drive, and another near the Brightline station in Downtown Miami experienced similar issues.\n\n\"Some of the flooding is pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie,\" said Ethan, a local resident caught in the rain with friends, who chose to brave the weather for an unusual evening activity.\n\nIn Miami Beach, the streets were heavily flooded, with areas like 71st Street, Harding Avenue, Alton Road, and 46th Street becoming impassable. One resident described seeing Corvettes almost underwater, estimating thousands of dollars in damage.\n\nBusinesses in Miami Beach are facing significant cleanup costs as floodwaters continue to seep in. Sheets of rain have reduced visibility from high-rises and slowed traffic on Interstate 95 near the 836 interchange, despite pumps working in overdrive to manage the water.\n\n\"It's a little annoying, but I mean, we will deal with it,\" another resident commented on the ongoing challenges.\n\nIn Hallandale, six inches of rain on Tuesday led to the temporary closure of Hallandale Beach Boulevard due to severe flooding. Although the avenue has since reopened, the forecast suggests more rain is on the way for South Florida residents.\n\nCommunities across South Florida are experiencing similar conditions. In Surfside, water gushed into a residential parking garage on 92nd Street and Collins Avenue.\n\nOpa-locka saw residential streets flooded, with even a Brinks truck struggling through deep puddles. Hialeah's mobile home community on West 29th Street was inundated, and residents had to navigate significant flooding.\n\nDania Beach and Hollywood also reported heavy flooding, with rain pouring down on the Turnpike and causing traffic issues on I-95 during rush hour.\n\nBroward County officials have proactively prepared for the continued rainfall by clearing debris from storm drains to facilitate water flow.\n\n\"We know this whole week and probably on through next week, based on the forecast, we're going to experience a lot of rain,\" one official stated.\n\nTeams have been dispatched to flood-prone locations to mitigate the impact.\n\nAs South Florida continues to cope with the adverse weather, residents are urged to stay safe and remain informed about the inclement weather.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

Earlier in the day, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis also declared states of emergency, along with the cities of Dania Beach and Sunny Isles Beach. In Dania Beach, there were at least 40 rescues conducted by police and fire crews.\n\nOn Thursday, all Broward County public schools are closed for summer sessions. Also closed are county courts, U.S. district courts, and Dania Beach's city hall. The city's Clerk's Office remains open for election-related business.\n\nMiami-Dade public schools will be open for the summer session.\n\nFlorida International University's Biscayne Bay campus and the campus at I-75 are closed due to flooding. Nova Southeastern University's Oceanographic Center is also closed Thursday due to flooding.\n\nDue to flooding conditions on sections of the railroad, Tri-Rail service between Metrorail Transfer and MiamiCentral stations remains suspended Thursday morning. Passengers are advised to use the Metrorail system.\n\nSeveral South Florida cities have received more than 15 inches of rain in the last two days.\n\nNorth Miami has received more than 20 inches, Hallandale Beach and Hollywood have received more than 19 inches, Davie has gotten nearly 18 inches, Dania Beach 10 inches, and Plantation nearly nine inches.\n\nA flood warning is in effect for much of Miami-Dade and Broward through 8 a.m. Thursday. A flood watch is in effect through Friday at 8 p.m.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include Miami, Hialeah, Fort Lauderdale, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Miramar, Pompano Beach, Davie, Miami Beach, Plantation, Sunrise, Tamarac, Margate, Coral Gables, Key Biscayne, South Miami, Lauderdale-By-The-Sea, Surfside, Miami Gardens and Hallandale Beach, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe wet, stormy weather pattern will hold in South Florida through the end of the work week, forecasters say, with the tropical moisture dissipating slightly by the weekend. That will leave the region a bit drier, but there will still be a chance for storms, but not nearly as widespread.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

The Tampa Bay area can normally expect 7.3 inches in the entire month of June.\n\nThe 3.93 inches of rain that fell at the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport airport in one hour is also a record.\n\nCoastal areas in Sarasota County saw up to 10 inches of rain on Tuesday alone, with the same possible Wednesday and throughout the week, the NWS office in Tampa Bay said.\n\nVideo uploaded to social media showed a fire truck and lanes of traffic driving badly flooded roads in Sarasota. Across the region cars became stranded after attempting to drive through deep water, including in Siesta Key to the west of Sarasota.\n\nThe weather system was caused by deep tropical moisture from a disturbance called 90-L by the National Hurricane Center, as well as a small area of low pressure of Florida's west coast and \"a very slow-moving stubborn convergent band,\" according to Jeff Berardelli, chief meteorologist at NBC affiliate WFLA of Tampa.\n\nMore rain is expected throughout this week across the state. The National Weather Service warned residents to expect more than 7 inches of rain in \"a prolonged heavy to excessive rainfall event across southern Florida for the next several days,\" in a forecast early Wednesday.\n\nThe rain comes after parts of Florida have spent many months in a drought. Sarasota has received 25 inches less rain than it normally would since the start of 2023, which was its driest on record.\n\nThe area's extremely dry soil has in part helped to limit flooding, as the soil could absorb more rain then normal, Berardelli wrote.\n\nMiami International Airport reported 462 delays and 52 cancellations, while Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport had 331 delays and 8 cancellations, NBC Miami reported.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota\u2013Bradenton_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota\u2013Bradenton International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siesta_Key,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siesta Key, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Siesta Key, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFLA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WFLA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVJ", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTVJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240612-florida-rain-mb-1151-4767d0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

According to the order, the weather system brought 10 to 15 inches of rain, impacting critical infrastructure such as major interstates, state and county roadways, airports, and schools.\n\nThe Miami branch of the NWS issued strong warnings to residents on Wednesday on X.\n\n\"Life-threatening flooding is now ongoing,\" the agency said. \"Please stay off the roadways and get to higher ground.\"\n\nAt the time of publishing, the NHC's latest outlook reported that an elongated area of low pressure currently over the Florida Peninsula is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\n\nThe storm system was pushing across Florida from the Gulf of Mexico at roughly the same time as the start of hurricane season in early June.\n\nThe weather system hasn't formed into a cyclone at this stage. The NHC reported that there was only a slight chance that it may form into a tropical system once it pushes into the Atlantic Ocean after crossing Florida.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days,\" the NHC reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami issued a warning of \"life-threatening flooding\" in the area on Wednesday afternoon. Residents were advised to seek higher ground, and drivers were urged to get off the roads.\n\nTo manage the emergency response, Mr. DeSantis appointed Kevin Guthrie, the director of the Division of Emergency Management, to coordinate the state's response.\n\nThe declaration also authorizes the activation of the Florida National Guard and the Florida State Guard to aid in emergency response efforts.\n\nAccording to the executive order, state agencies have the authority to suspend regulatory statutes and rules that might impede necessary actions to address the crisis.\n\nThe Florida Division of Emergency Management has actively deployed requested resources to impacted communities, it announced on X.\n\n\"It's never safe to enter floodwaters -- and they're especially dangerous at night. Turn around, don't drown! Listen to all orders from local officials and have multiple ways to receive emergency alerts,\" it said.\n\nThe executive order also allows medical professionals with valid licenses from other states to provide free services in Florida during the emergency, under the auspices of the American Red Cross or the Florida Department of Health.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Many homes and businesses were flooded -- and some are experiencing the same thing again.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallandale_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hallandale Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hallandale Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dew point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Miami,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Miami, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Miami, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AccuWeather", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AccuWeather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 9}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The forecast calls for another round of drenching rain Thursday afternoon, with another 2 to 4.5 inches of rain expected Thursday through Saturday.\n\n\"Don't be deceived by the sun peeking out from the clouds,\" Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a morning press conference in the county's emergency operations center in Doral. \"We've seen clear skies this morning, but we are expecting heavy rainfall once again today.\"\n\nThe deluge continues to put pressure on the county's sewer system, with the downpours and rising groundwater levels forcing fresh water into sewer pipes. That risks overwhelming treatment plants that can only handle so much liquid on a given day. Levine Cava said residents could help by reducing water usage during peak morning hours and by following the law and not loosening manhole covers to create makeshift drains on the streets.\n\nCounty crews were out Wednesday creating temporary dams around sewage pump stations in flood-prone areas and deploying pumps to reduce street flooding.\n\nLevine Cava described a government largely functioning as normal on Thursday morning, despite an emergency declaration she issued the prior evening. No major roads are closed, and transit service continues as normal, with Wednesday's bus route detours around flooded streets now mostly lifted.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, State Farm reported more than 300 vehicular flood claims from South Florida so far, said spokesman Michal Brower.\n\n\"Majority of the auto claims are for flood damage, and number of claims reported could be expected to increase as rain is projected to continue today and tomorrow and additional drivers discover flood damage to vehicles,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nThe National Weather Service's Miami office reported that more than 19 inches of rain fell between Tuesday and Wednesday in Hallandale Beach, which saw the worst of the flooding in Broward County on Wednesday, along with Hollywood.\n\nIn Miami-Dade, North Miami saw more than 20 inches of rain, and Miami Beach saw more than 13 inches over the two days.\n\nThat much rain was enough to sweep into homes up and down the coast, including Sam Demarco's house in Hollywood. Water seeped under his front door, and passing cars sent wakes that pushed the water even further inside.\n\n\"We were kind of ambushed today,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nAt that time, Demarco's front yard was knee-deep in water. He had a pile of towels in the hallway to his bedroom to make sure the flood water in his living room didn't reach it. Demarco's home was flooded in April 2023, destroying all of the furniture at the front of his house. Since then, he's moved most of his furniture to the back of the home to prepare for weather like this week's.\n\n\"I'm not giving up paradise for a little bad weather,\" Demarco said.", "source":

Here's what to know.\n\nA messy glob of tropical moisture sitting near Florida's west coast will bring a mix of rain and humidity to Tampa Bay this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, forecasters with the National Hurricane Center said it was watching the rough patch for possible tropical development. But they said that was unlikely and wouldn't occur until days from now, after the weather had passed over Florida and into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"Regardless of development, heavy rainfall is expected across portions of Florida during the next few days,\" according to the hurricane center.\n\nEarlier forecasts called for as much as 10 inches of rain in the Tampa Bay area, but on Tuesday the amount of forecasted rainfall declined. The National Weather Service said it anticipates up to 6 inches in Tampa Bay through Friday and 8 inches through Sunday.\n\nSouthwest Florida is expected to get even more rain -- up to 15 inches in Fort Myers, for instance -- and forecasters are warning of possible flooding and rising rivers in that part of the state.\n\nRainfall in the Tampa Bay area is welcome news. For weeks, the area has sweltered under record-breaking heat and a drought (though typical for this time of year). Should the rainfall remain manageable and spread out, meteorologists say it will be beneficial for Tampa Bay.\n\nSo what can Florida -- and Tampa Bay -- expect from the blob of moisture during its long, leisurely stay? Here's a breakdown of what to know.\n\nThe area of rough weather is being described as a \"plume of tropical moisture,\" according to Spectrum Bay News 9.\n\nIt extends from the Caribbean Sea, spreading toward the eastern Gulf of Mexico and into the Florida peninsula, said Ross Giarratana, a meteorologist from the National Weather Service's Tampa Bay office.\n\nThink of it as a firehose of soggy air being transported straight from the tropics.\n\n\"Any of these storms and showers that develop really will have some high rainfall totals in a short period of time,\" Giarratana said.\n\nThe hurricane center said in a Tuesday afternoon forecast that the patch of weather has just a 10% chance of tropical development by Thursday and a 20% chance over the next week.\n\nThis Atlantic season has yet to see a named storm. It's the slowest start to hurricane season in more than a decade. The first named storm will be called Alberto.\n\nHowever, top hurricane academics Tuesday said the sleeping giant will soon awaken.\n\nIn their June forecast update, researchers at Colorado State University maintained their initial forecast for an \"extremely active\" Atlantic hurricane season. The renowned climate school in April predicted 11 hurricanes would spin up this season, the most ever expected in the institution's nearly three decades of early season forecasting.\n\nIt has been two months since their initial prediction, and university experts are sticking with that number. Record-warm Atlantic temperatures and an arriving La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern are to blame, researchers said.\n\nWhile forecasters anticipated rainfall amounts up to 10 inches in Tampa Bay earlier this week, Kyle Hanson, a meteorologist for Spectrum Bay News 9, said the moisture has shifted further south and likely won't cause as much rain here.\n\nHanson said rainfall is likely to come in patches for the next few days.\n\n\"It'll start raining for a half an hour, then it'll stop, and that can happen again at some point in the day,\" Hanson said. \"Then it'll just be kind of off and on like that through about Friday.\"\n\nA flood advisory was issued for a portion of southwest Pasco and northern Pinellas counties Tuesday afternoon, when heavy rains were expected to cause urban and small stream flooding. Additionally, portions of South Florida are under a flood watch through Wednesday night.\n\nThe weather service's Southeast River Forecast Center is expecting heavy rains in Central and South Florida could produce minor flooding, and even flash floods in some areas.\n\nThe Manatee River at State Road 64 is expected to reach 10.5 feet on Thursday. Minor flooding begins at 11 feet. The Myakka River at Myakka State Park will, at 6.9 feet, be a hair away from minor flooding, which occurs at 7 feet.\n\nHorse Creek near Arcadia was expected to reach a minor flooding stage at 13.8 feet.\n\nGiarratana said the weather service is watching for areas that receive multiple rounds of rain, especially urban areas, which are most vulnerable to flooding.\n\nAreas with concrete and buildings rely more heavily on drainage systems as opposed to green areas that can naturally soak up water.\n\nShould flooding occur, you should not walk or drive through waters. It takes just six inches of moving water to knock a person off their feet, the weather service said.\n\nFlood water also may be deeper than it appears, and can hide sharp objects, electrical wires and chemicals, the weather service said. If you find yourself caught in flood waters, get to the highest ground possible and call 911.\n\nThe rain the area is experiencing this week is not uncommon for this time of year, Hanson from Bay News 9 said.\n\n\"We're due for this,\" Hanson said. \"We haven't had an event like this yet this year.\"\n\nThe rainfall expected in south Florida is less likely, Hanson said. However, because of the area's proximity to the tropics, it can happen every so often.\n\n\"It's certainly an event, and certainly something that does not happen often -- you could say this is like a once a year type of event,\" Hanson said.\n\nWhile the rainfall amounts are high, they'll be over multiple days in a widespread area, which should lower the chance of flooding.\n\nThe showers won't be like last year, when 25 inches of rain fell on Fort Lauderdale in a single day, flooding streets and stalling cars. That kind of rainfall is more like a once every 1,000 years occurrence.\n\nBecause of the drought, the ground should be able to soak up the water. When the ground is more saturated, it becomes more difficult for the ground to slurp up rain water.\n\nThe United States drought monitor shows portions of Tampa Bay are running from abnormally dry to a moderate drought. Areas to the south, like Manatee and Sarasota counties, are in a severe drought.\n\nAccording to the Southwest Water Management District, from Jan. 1 to June 9, the district-wide rainfall deficit was about 10 inches.\n\n\"The area's current low water levels will certainly benefit from the forecasted rain this week,\" the water management district said in an email to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nHanson said the rain may not entirely pull the area out of a drought, but he expects more rain in the near future. The rainy season may settle in after this week's storms pass through.\n\n\"From here on out,\" Hanson said, \"we're going to see more wet weather than we have been seeing previously.\"", "source":

A strong thunderstorm was headed towards inland parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties just before 3 p.m., bringing winds as high as 30 mph.\n\nThe City of Fort Lauderdale told residents in a 3 p.m. update that the city is anticipating 10 to 12 inches of rain from 3 to 7 p.m. as storms roll through.\n\n\"The groundwater table is nearly saturated,\" the city wrote on X. \"This will create flooding conditions very quickly.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's hard-hit cities, including Hallandale Beach, Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, and Dania Beach, crews worked to pump water, and even some residents helped to de-clog drains along flooded streets before the rain begins again. Many drains are clogged Thursday following Wednesday's storms, officials say. Meanwhile, tow trucks have continued to work since Wednesday to remove dozens of cars from the roads.\n\nBuildings were also affected. Hallandale Beach shut down its City Hall because of flooding as of 2:30 p.m., Mayor Joy Cooper wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"This will allow for residents currently at City Hall to conclude their business and hopefully make it home safely,\" she said.\n\nIn Miramar, several homes were flooded with up to 8 inches of water, city officials said.\n\nCity officials from Hollywood, Dania Beach, Hallandale and Fort Lauderdale said it was too early to say how many homes were damaged. But some residents have already reported flooding in Dania Beach and Fort Lauderdale, though largely not to the same extent as April 2023.\n\nIn Wilton Manors, resident Boyd Corbin reported seeing sewage bubbling out of manhole covers in the street.\n\nSouth Florida's passenger rail services had returned to close to normal earlier in the day, but air travelers continued to suffer protracted delays and large numbers of flight cancellations as heavy rains again hindered the region's transportation system.\n\nBrightline, the high-speed rail service, started the day with a modified schedule after floodwaters made a mile-long stretch of tracks between Aventura and Miami impassable late Wednesday along the Florida East Coast Railway corridor.\n\nTri-Rail, the three-county commuter service that runs west of Interstate 95 through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, reopened its connection to MiamiCentral station in downtown Miami.\n\nBut it was another day of inconveniences and frustration at South Florida's three international airports as passengers again faced hours-long waits triggered by bad weather.\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport advised passengers to check with their airlines for flight status updates before leaving for their air terminals.\n\n\"Our terminal & airport exit roadways are clear, but a section of E, Perimeter Rd. into #FLL is closed due to flooding; use alternate routes,\" the airport declared on its X account.\n\nShortly after midday Thursday, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood had 182 delays and 116 cancellations, Miami International had 186 delays and 269 cancellations, while Palm Beach International had nominal numbers of delays and canceled flights, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\nPort Everglades said it has remained open for business during the bad weather even though some of its roads flooded.

Is there more coming?", "body": "The National Weather Service issued a dire flash flood emergency for \"catastrophic\" flood impacts between Miami Dade and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe episode comes 14 months to the day since an incredible 22.5 inches fell on Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport in a single day, leading to unprecedented flood impacts. Both episodes bear the fingerprint of human-caused climate change, which is increasing the intensity and severity of top-tier rain events.\n\nTo make matters worse, the ongoing rain event is far from over, and another half-foot or more of rain could fall in some spots before downpours finally wind down into Friday. In some areas, roadways are still impassable due to high water.\n\nHere's how much rain fell just on Wednesday:\n\nIf we look at what has fallen since Monday morning, there are a few totals closing in on 18 inches:\n\nA number of records were set across the area. Wednesday's 9.54 inches nabs the top spot for the wettest summer day on record, surpassing the 8.6 inches that fell on June 2, 1930. It's the eighth wettest day at the airport of all time.\n\nA typical June averages 9.55 inches of rain, meaning an entire month's worth of rain came down in one day.\n\nBetween 1 and 2 p.m. Eastern time Wednesday, 2.41 inches of rain fell. That's the seventh wettest hour on record at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport. Hourly weather observations date back to 1973, but seven of the wettest hours on record have occurred in the past 10 years, and all have occurred since 2003.\n\nOne station in Hollywood, Fla., logged 10.22 inches of rain in six hours, which statistically falls just shy of a hundred-year rain event, or an event that has a 1 percent chance of happening in a given location any given year. Sunny Isles Beach got 6.47 inches in 3 hours, which occurs on average once every 25 years.\n\nIt's well established that the frequency, and intensity, of rainfall events in increasing in tandem with our warming atmosphere. A warmer world is a wetter world, since warmer air has a greater propensity to hold water. For every degree of increase in heat in the atmosphere, it can hold 4 percent more moisture.\n\nThat's why extremes like this are becoming more common, and rainfall rates are getting heavier too. Moreover, a more saturated atmosphere during high-end events increases precipitation efficiency; in other words, more of the raindrops survive to the ground without evaporating, leading to more rapid accumulations.\n\nWeather models depict continued shower and thunderstorm activity across South Florida on Thursday afternoon and evening, with the chance that another 3 to 6 inches falls. Localized greater totals can't be ruled out.\n\nThe rainfall won't extend much north of a line from Punta Gorda to the Space Coast, though a renegade afternoon shower or thunderstorm is possible.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, only typical late-day summertime storms are expected. The parent low-pressure system will be pulling into the northwest Atlantic, where it has a low-end chance of acquiring subtropical characteristics as it passes over the warm waters or the Gulf Stream. According to the National Hurricane Center, the system has a 20 percent chance of development.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_cappucci@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Matthew Cappucci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Isles_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunny Isles Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sunny Isles Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Numerical weather prediction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subtropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_convection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric convection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evaporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dew point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Precipitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_Gorda,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punta Gorda, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punta Gorda, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4EYJAH3BZ5YXC2XXPXI6EOE5EQ_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

According to the map, multiple locations could receive at least 6 inches of rain, although some areas could see much more. Fort Myers is expecting the most rain, with the forecast anticipating 15 to 20 inches from the storm. The city's average monthly rainfall in June is 9.66 inches, meaning this week could produce more than double the month's average precipitation.\n\nOther Florida cities expecting to receive at least their average June rainfall this week include Belle Glade, Immokalee, West Palm Beach, Punta Gorda and Sarasota. Records show that the average June rainfall for each of those cities is as follows: 9.49 inches in Belle Glade, 8 inches in Immokalee, 8.48 inches in West Palm Beach, 9.24 inches in Punta Gorda and 7.05 inches in Sarasota.\n\nAccording to the NWS map, each of those cities is expected to receive at least 8 inches of rain this week. Others are anticipating even more, including Immokalee and Punta Gorda, where 10 to 15 inches of rain is forecast.\n\nLuke Culver, an NWS meteorologist, told Newsweek that every few years, Florida cities experience a rainstorm that produces their monthly average rainfall in only a few days. He warned that people in the affected areas should be alert for flooding.\n\n\"Conditions are favorable for potential localized flash flooding, so have a way to be able to get those warnings if we issue any and be able to take action,\" he said.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, a flood watch was in place for much of southern Florida. However, much of the region has experienced dry weather, meaning streams are low and primed to receive heavy rain.\n\nRoss Giarratana, an NWS meteorologist, told Newsweek that widespread rain has already begun falling across the state. The heaviest amounts so far have been experienced in southwest Florida, he said, specifically in Lee County and Sarasota County. Fort Myers has seen 3 inches of rain in six hours.\n\nGiarratana added that rain is expected to be heaviest on Tuesday and Wednesday but would continue falling into the weekend.", "source": {"uri":

In some areas water has swamped lawns and pushed up to the front doors of houses and other buildings.\n\nParts of Interstate 95, a main north-south route along the East Coast, were closed due to flooding on Wednesday.\n\n\"The problem is that there is no place for the rain to go,\" said Oravec. \"The ground is so saturated. In some places water is rising up from the sewers.\"\n\nIn nearby Fort Lauderdale, Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a city-wide emergency due to flooding. He said the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission was sending boats and high-water vehicles to assist any rescues if needed.\n\nTrantalis urged people to stay off roadways. \"It's crucial to never attempt to drive through high water,\" he warned in a message on the X social media platform.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also declared states of emergency, freeing up money and resources to better cope with the storm and its aftermath.\n\nForecasters are expecting eight to 13 hurricanes in the Atlantic this season, seven of which could build into major storms. Overall, some 17 to 25 named tropical storms are expected.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces about 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes.\n\nIn recent years, the frequency and intensity of hurricanes have increased linked to warming sea temperatures caused by higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Frank McGurty,

According to FlightAware, the international airports in Miami and Fort Lauderdale currently have the highest percentage of flight cancellations in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlightAware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FlightAware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collier_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collier County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Collier County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.kurv.com/710am/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/APTOPIX_Rainy_Florida_24165007030482-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 116, "textEnd": 123}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

Formation is most likely once the low-pressure area moves off the Florida coast.\n\nInvest is short for \"investigation\" and refers to a weather feature that the NHC is investigating. It should be noted that it is not necessarily an area that is expected to develop into a tropical system. It's simply an area being investigated for any number of reasons.", "source": {"uri": "wesh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WESH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "averi_kremposky@wesh.com", "name": "Averi Kremposky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trough (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Central_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Central Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WESH", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WESH"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volusia_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volusia County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Volusia County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titusville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titusville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Titusville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradenton,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bradenton, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everglades_City,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everglades City, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Everglades City, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasota,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sarasota, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Miami,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Miami, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Miami, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially_Responsible", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Socially Responsible", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/flooding-south-florida-6669897e13430.png?crop=0.894xw:1.00xh;0.0407xw,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

In some areas water has swamped lawns and pushed up to the front doors of houses and other buildings.\n\nParts of Interstate 95, a main north-south route along the East Coast, were closed due to flooding on Wednesday.\n\n\"The problem is that there is no place for the rain to go,\" said Oravec. \"The ground is so saturated. In some places water is rising up from the sewers.\"\n\nThe storm led officials to postpone the demolition of the building at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida where 17 students and staff were killed in February 2018 in one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history.\n\nThe building, some parts still bloodstained, was closed immediately after the shooting and fenced off to preserve evidence. The demolition has been rescheduled for Friday.\n\nIn nearby Fort Lauderdale, Mayor Dean Trantalis declared a city-wide emergency due to flooding. He said the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission was sending boats and high-water vehicles to assist any rescues if needed.\n\nTrantalis urged people to stay off roadways. \"It's crucial to never attempt to drive through high water,\" he warned in a message on the X social media platform.\n\nMiami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava also declared states of emergency, freeing up money and resources to better cope with the storm and its aftermath.\n\nHURRICANE FORECAST\n\nForecasters are expecting eight to 13 hurricanes in the Atlantic this season, seven of which could build into major storms. Overall some 17 to 25 named tropical storms are expected.\n\nAn average hurricane season produces about 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes.\n\nIn recent years, the frequency and intensity of hurricanes has increased linked to warming sea temperatures caused by higher carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Frank McGurty,

The rain is expected to be heaviest from Wednesday to Friday, with the National Weather Service (NWS) warning that flooding could begin as early as Tuesday and continue into the weekend.\n\nOn Monday morning, the NWS office for Florida's Tampa Bay area shared a map that showed rainfall estimates through Friday. According to the map, the Palm Beach area is expected to receive up to 10 inches of rain, more than its monthly average rainfall, in only four days.\n\nHowever, as of Tuesday afternoon Palm Beach had received less than half an inch of rain, NWS senior meteorologist Robert Garcia told Newsweek. Storms are happening in the region now, and more heavy rain is expected.\n\nMar-a-Lago has made it through more serious storms, including hurricanes.\n\nThe flood watch was issued for Palm Beach County on Tuesday. The watch is expected to expire on Wednesday evening, but Garcia said it could be extended throughout the week.\n\n\"Excessive runoff may result in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations,\" the NWS flood watch said. \"Flooding may occur in poor drainage and urban areas.\"\n\nThe rain is expected to relieve the severe drought across Florida, but the drought could make it difficult for the soil to absorb water. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor Map, all of Palm Beach County was experiencing moderate drought, with more than 50 percent of the county experiencing severe drought.\n\n\"High rainfall rates and slow moving storms will result in flooding concerns, especially in urban and poor drainage locations,\" the flood watch said.\n\nMany cities across Florida are expecting to receive at least their monthly allotment of rain from this current storm, including Fort Myers, Punta Gorda, Sarasota, West Palm Beach, Belle Glade and Immokalee. According to the NWS map, each of those cities is expected to receive at least 8 inches of rain this week. Others are anticipating even more, including Immokalee and Punta Gorda, where 10 to 15 inches of rain is forecast.\n\nNWS meteorologist Luke Culver previously told Newsweek that it's not uncommon for areas like West Palm Beach and other Florida cities to see their monthly average rainfall from only one storm, especially during the summer months.

That's the warning from the National Weather Service and local emergency managers as more rain is heading to South Florida. While Palm Beach County did better than much of the region, rain totals for the 48 hours leading into 3 a.m. Thursday are still notable. Parts of Boca Raton received 7.65 inches of rain. Boca West logged 7.28 inches. Delray Beach logged 5.23 inches, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn Hallandale, nearly 20 inches of rain fell over 48 hours, with Hollywood just behind at 19.10. Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport logged 12.84 inches. North Miami recorded 20.43 inches. Rescue workers across the region spent much of the night and early morning hours rescuing stranded motorists.\n\nI-95, which was closed in Broward County for several hours due to flooding on Wednesday, is open again as of 5 a.m. Thursday. However, many side streets -- especially in Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood, Pembroke Pines, and Miramar remain impassable. Flights at all of the region's airports are experiencing major delays and often cancellations. Already 100 flights have been cancelled at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International as of early Thursday morning.\n\nBrightline has stopped all service south of Fort Lauderdale until further notice. Fort Lauderdale is the last stop for now. There is northbound service from Miami or Aventura.

Torrential rains battered South Florida on Wednesday, prompting officials to warn residents to avoid \"life-threatening flooding\" in some of the state's most populous areas.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Miami advised residents to stay indoors, avoid traveling, and steer clear of hazardous moving waters. Flood warnings for parts of four South Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, are in effect until 8 a.m. Thursday.\n\nThe heavy downpour is disrupting air travel in the region. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport reported that its entrances and exits were flooded.\n\nBy Wednesday evening, 284 flights in and out of that airport had been canceled. Meanwhile, Miami International Airport saw a combined total of 326 cancellations, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nAs of late Wednesday afternoon, various locations across the region had recorded over half a foot of rain in the past 48 hours: 11.28 inches at Fort Lauderdale Airport, 7.49 inches at Miami Airport, 8 inches in Fort Myers, and 7.74 inches in Sarasota.\n\nThe continuous hours of rain have made pumps nearly ineffective, as there is nowhere for the excess water to be directed.\n\nNumerous images and videos of the waterlogged city have surfaced on social media, showing streets submerged in water. With ongoing heavy rain and flood warnings, fans are calling for the ICC to relocate the remaining games scheduled in Florida to New York or Dallas.\n\nThree more matches are scheduled to be played at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground in Lauderhill, Florida, on June 14, 15, and 16. Two of these Group A matches are crucial for the tournament, with the USA and Pakistan's qualification for the Super 8 at stake.\n\nCo-hosts USA will face Ireland on June 14 in a vital Group A clash. A win for the USA would secure their place in the Super 8 stage. Even if the match is washed out, Monank Patel's team will advance to the next round with five points from four matches.\n\nA washout would be detrimental to Pakistan's chances of qualifying for the next round, as they are currently in third place on the points table with only one win from three matches, totaling two points. The Babar Azam-led side is heavily reliant on Ireland to defeat the USA in their final fixture to stay in contention for the Super 8.\n\nIf Ireland manages to beat the USA, Pakistan will also need to win their last game against the same opponent on June 16. Therefore, the 2009 champions cannot afford for their final match to be washed out, as it would result in their elimination from the tournament.\n\nPakistan began their campaign with a shocking super over loss to the USA. In their second fixture, they failed to chase a modest target of 120, losing the match by six runs. Thus, inclement weather in Florida would not only dampen the tournament's excitement but also pose a significant hurdle in the ICC's efforts to promote cricket in the USA.", "source": {"uri":

The heat, which shows no signs of slowing down in some areas, also has experts predicting a record-breaking forecast of 17 to 25 tropical storms and hurricanes this year.\n\nThe rain that hit Sarasota earlier this week is so rare that NBC News reported it is only expected every 500 to 1,000 years. The gulf coast of the state received 8 inches of rain between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. EDT on Tuesday. The Tampa Bay area usually receives 7.3 inches of rain throughout the entirety of June, according to NBC News.\n\nThe U.S. has been battered with a series of severe -- and sometimes record-breaking -- weather patterns since the start of 2024. Severe thunderstorms led to multiple tornadoes throughout the central and midwest during the spring, and California saw multiple atmospheric river storms at the start of the year.

Many drains are clogged Thursday following Wednesday's storms, officials say. Meanwhile, tow trucks have continued to work since Wednesday to remove dozens of cars from the roads.\n\nBuildings were also affected. Hallandale Beach shut down its City Hall because of flooding as of 2:30 p.m., Mayor Joy Cooper wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"This will allow for residents currently at City Hall to conclude their business and hopefully make it home safely,\" she said.\n\nFuture radar shows the heaviest bands of the system approaching during rush hour.\n\nIn Miramar, several homes were flooded with up to 8 inches of water, city officials said.\n\nSouth Florida's passenger rail services had returned to close to normal, but air travelers continued to suffer protracted delays and large numbers of flight cancellations as heavy rains again hindered the region's transportation system.\n\nBrightline, the high-speed rail service, started the day with a modified schedule after floodwaters made a mile-long stretch of tracks between Aventura and Miami impassable late Wednesday along the Florida East Coast Railway corridor.\n\nTri-Rail, the three-county commuter service that runs west of Interstate 95 through Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties, reopened its connection to MiamiCentral station in downtown Miami.\n\nBut it was another day of inconveniences and frustration at South Florida's three international airports as passengers again faced hours-long waits triggered by bad weather.\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Miami International Airport advised passengers to check with their airlines for flight status updates before leaving for their air terminals.\n\n\"Our terminal & airport exit roadways are clear, but a section of E, Perimeter Rd. into #FLL is closed due to flooding; use alternate routes,\" the airport declared on its X account.\n\nShortly after midday Thursday, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood had 182 delays and 116 cancellations, Miami International had 186 delays and 269 cancellations, while Palm Beach International had nominal numbers of delays and canceled flights, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\nPort Everglades said it has remained open for business during the bad weather even though some of its roads flooded. Cars and trucks on Wednesday were able to travel through the port, said spokeswoman Joy Oglesby.\n\n\"We are operating as normal today,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType":

With two days between Games 2 and 3, the Panthers opted to stay home the extra day.\n\n\"We didn't like the idea of getting them up [Tuesday] early enough to get in at a reasonable time in Edmonton,\" said Panthers coach Paul Maurice, who added he didn't get home until about 1 a.m. Tuesday after Game 2. \"We did not see a value in it. It's also all logistics. We're going to go up there and be fairly cloistered just with the amount of people outside. We'll stay close to the rink so we're gong to be in that building [a lot]. We didn't necessarily need another day in there.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nGame 3 of the Stanley Cup Final is scheduled for an 8 p.m. start Thursday. Game 4 is 8 p.m. Saturday.\n\nThe Panthers lead the best-of-7 series 2-0 after winning Game 1 3-0 on Saturday and Game 2 4-1 on Monday.\n\nSouth Florida is in the midst of a second consecutive day of a deluge of rain.\n\nMiami saw about 4 to 6 inches of rain on Tuesday alone, according to preliminary results from the Miami office of the National Weather Service. Miami Beach saw even more, at nearly 7 inches.\n\nBroward County was equally as impacted, with around 6 inches in Hallandale Beach and 5 inches in Hollywood.

The Miami Herald confirmed that Brightline service between its Miami and Aventura stations has been suspended because of the torrential rain. The high-speed train company is arranging bus services for passengers to traverse between the two stations.\n\nTravelers posted videos of water on the tracks on X.\n\nAs of 4:40 p.m., Miami International Airport canceled 221 flights and delayed 165 others, which is 53% of all the flights at the airport Wednesday, said Greg Chin, communications director for the Miami-Dade Aviation Department.\n\nBeyond transportation systems, Miami-Dade College and Florida International University canceled their evening classes, citing inclement weather. FIU also has closed several campuses, including the one in Biscayne Bay.\n\nWhat about Broward?\n\nAll Broward County libraries and a few government services, such as animal care and the medical examiner's office, have been closed.\n\nThe county has not said whether buses or other transit have been halted.\n\nSome major Broward cities, including Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, have also closed administrative offices completely or partially.\n\nThe deluge forced the closure of Interstate 95 at Griffin Road, causing hours of traffic as commuters entered rush hour seeking alternative routes that also experienced flooding.\n\nREAD MORE: Miami, Fort Lauderdale airports see hours-long delays as heavy rain swamps the region\n\nAt Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, as of 6:11 p.m., there have been 158 delays and 273 cancellations., according to FlightAware, a flight tracker.\n\nBroward College announced its evening classes were canceled, and at least one campus was closed.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "devoun_cetoute@miamiherald.com", "name": "Devoun Cetoute", "type": "author",

Ron DeSantis declared a flash flood emergency this week in parts of Southern Florida after the region was hit by more than 12 inches of rain.\n\n\"Preliminary reports indicate that the rainfall and flooding has affected and may continue to impact the operational capability of critical infrastructure, including major interstates, state and county roadways, airports, schools, and other critical infrastructure throughout these counties,\" the emergency declaration reads.\n\n\"Additional rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms are forecasted for South Florida for the next several days which will further exacerbate ongoing flood conditions over already impacted and vulnerable metropolitan areas,\" it continues.\n\nThe state of emergency applies to Broward, Collier, Lee, Miami-Dade, and Sarasota counties.\n\nWhat Florida homeowners face -- now and this summer\n\nSo far this year, Florida has seen six weather-related disasters that cost the state billions in aid and repairs. But the state may need to brace for even more extreme weather this summer.\n\nIn May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released its 2024 hurricane season report, warning that the Atlantic Ocean is currently at high temperatures that are typically not seen until August, which could lead to a record number of hurricanes.\n\nIn addition to shouldering the storms themselves, states with the most extreme weather -- which include Florida, California, and Louisiana -- have been especially hard hit by rising insurance rates.\n\nBut so far, at least, Florida remains a popular place to live.\n\n\"Despite the risks, many people buy property in Florida due to its attractive lifestyle and natural beauty,\" says Realtor.com\u00ae economist Jiayi Xu. \"In addition, Florida has a diverse economy that offers numerous job opportunities, a draw to many. Furthermore, Florida is one of the few states with no state income tax, which can be a significant financial advantage for residents. Additionally, property values in Florida tend to appreciate consistently over time, making buying property here a potentially good investment.\"\n\nXu also points out that there are ways homebuyers can curb flooding dangers by vetting a property carefully.\n\n\"Choosing a property in regions less prone to severe hurricanes can mitigate risk,\" points out Xu. \"Realtor.com provides property-specific environmental risk scores, which include hurricanes and floods. Prospective homeowners can leverage these scores to gauge climate-related risks across various locales, aiding them in pinpointing 'safer' areas prior to finalizing their choice.\"\n\nWhen it comes to buying a home in an area prone to hurricanes and flooding, Florida real estate agent Cara Ameer agrees that extra due diligence is key.\n\n\"Buyers need to look at if the property is in a flood zone, and if so, is it in a zone requiring flood insurance,\" she says.\n\nShe also says homeowners should ask what is the proximity to any kind of water besides just the ocean.\n\n\"Lakes, streams, rivers, canals, manmade ponds -- these can all overflow and could potentially impact the property where it is located,\" she points out. \"You also want to see if the property sits on or near a marsh or any kind of tidal waterways.\"\n\nIf you're currently living in a flood-prone zone, you should make sure that your home insurance policy includes coverage for flooding. In many cases, you have to purchase that coverage separately.\n\nThere are also steps you can take to shore up your property. The Federal Emergency Management Agency recommends sealing up any cracks and gaps in your home, anchoring external fuel tanks, and designing landscaping that helps to direct water away from your home.", "source": {"uri": "realtor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realtor.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julie_gerstein@realtor.com", "name": "Julie Gerstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

More downpours, flooding possible for the rest of the week", "body": "By Shira Moolten | smoolten@sunsentinel.com | South Florida Sun Sentinel\n\nThe downpour that left roads flooded and growing numbers of people stranded throughout Broward and Miami-Dade counties on Wednesday may continue through the work week, forecasters warned.\n\nThough the rain may taper off slightly overnight, \"there is potential we could see this amount again tomorrow and again Friday,\" Barry Baxter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Miami, said Wednesday evening.\n\nThe flooding across South Florida was already extremely rare and severe, leading the weather service to issue a flash flood emergency, the most urgent type of warning possible. The last time such a warning was issued was during last year's devastating April storm. It is reserved for the most dire situations in which highways are shut down and flooded roads are strewn with cars, all of which took place then and again on Wednesday.\n\nThe emergency is \"issued for the EXCEEDINGLY RARE situations when extremely heavy rain is leading to a severe threat to human life and CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE from a flash flood is happening or will happen soon,\" according to the weather service website.\n\nThe downpour is caused by a trough between two potential systems with chances of forming in the Gulf of Mexico and in the northwest waters of the Atlantic, Baxter said. Though neither system would directly affect South Florida, the trough connecting them causes deep moisture in the atmosphere.\n\n\"That's gonna sit over us tomorrow and Friday,\" Baxter said. \"It's not gonna budge much.\"\n\nThe already saturated ground will also make the chances of flooding even more likely.\n\nFriday may be slightly drier than Thursday but not by much, depending on how quickly the trough weakens. Saturday and Sunday still both have a 70% chance of rain.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shira_moolten@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Shira Moolten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Sentinel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun Sentinel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broward_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Broward County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dew point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(meteorology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trough (meteorology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/North America", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tfl-l-flooding-hollywood-03.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644091", "eventUri": "eng-9644091", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 98, "relevance": 1}

Go ahead and Subscribe here.\n\nCruise travelers departing from south Florida homeports through this weekend might face some weather-related difficulties with Invest 90-L - a significant low pressure area of storminess - bringing several inches of rain to the region in the past few days. Invests are the precursors to tropical lows and depressions that may develop into tropical storms and later into hurricanes.\n\nSome areas of the southern part of the Sunshine State are seeing rainfall totals of 9+ inches over a few days, which could lead to localized flooding or road closures. This could make driving to the cruise ports more challenging, though no large areas of trouble have yet been reported.\n\nPortMiami, for example, has received 4.5 inches of rain in the past 24 hours, while Port Everglades has received 2.75 inches and Port Tampa Bay has received 2 inches. These totals are just for a 24-hour period, and rainfall over the past few days has been significant after a period of lighter-than-average rainfall. It should be noted that Florida's sandy soil quickly absorbs water once the rain stops.\n\nWith storms expected to continue until and into the weekend, several more inches rain are expected to accumulate and cruise travelers could be facing hazardous conditions as they travel to their homeports.\n\n\"An elongated area of low pressure over the Florida peninsula is producing a large are of disorganized showers and thunderstorms,\" the latest update from the National Hurricane Center read. \"Heavy rainfall is forecast to continue across portions of the Florida peninsula during the next few days.\"\n\nThis is causing anxiety for travelers with respect to potential flight delays in the days leading up to embarkation, as well as flooding that may close roads or otherwise impede reaching cruise terminals. Some travelers with upcoming Carnival cruises have reached out to John Heald, the cruise line's Brand Ambassador, asking for - even demanding - updates on delays or cancellations.\n\n\"I wish you would stop procrastinating. Tell us if cruises are canceled for those of us sailing from Miami, which is flooded right now,\" one traveler asked.\n\nTo clarify, there is no severe flooding reported in Miami (though temporary localized flooding is certainly possible), and other comments noting 30 inches of rain or similar spectacular conditions are greatly exaggerated. Nevertheless, Heald responded with reassurances for all guests.\n\n\"I do understand and I promise that if there is, or any changes or delays, that we will look after you and inform me about them. But at this time, there are no changes that I am aware of,\" Heald wrote Wednesday morning.\n\nAs one of the busiest cruise ports in the world, PortMiami has multiple cruise ships in port nearly every day, and weekends are particularly busy.\n\nOn Friday, June 14, Royal Caribbean International's Freedom of the Seas, MSC Cruises' MSC Magnifica, and Carnival Cruise Line's Carnival Conquest are all debarking and embarking guests. Saturday, June 15 is an even busier day, with Independence of the Seas, Icon of the Seas, Norwegian Sky, MSC Seascape, Carnival Sunrise, and Carnival Celebration all in port.\n\nAll six of the vessels on Saturday are turning around - both debarking and embarking guests. When the totals from all the ships are combined, as many as 55,000 guests may be moving through the port area, not to mention crew members, vendors, and terminal employees.\n\nPoor weather can complicate traffic with poor visibility, localized flooded streets or intersections, and the potential for downed wires, trees, or other hazards. Anyone driving to the cruise port - whether in Miami, Tampa, or Fort Lauderdale - should stay alert to traffic reports and plan for extra time to reach the cruise terminal.\n\nGuests driving from further away should note that Florida Statue 316.217.1.b requires vehicle headlights to be on during any rain. This improves the visibility of the vehicle for other drivers as well. Slowing down and driving cautiously is always advisable during periods of heavy squalls.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that any cruises will be cancelled or delayed because of heavy rain. While it can be more challenging to reach the cruise terminal during poor weather, the ships can safely operate and all guests should still plan to be onboard before the final boarding time printed on their boarding pass.\n\nRead Also: How a Hurricane Could Affect Your Cruise\n\nGuests should stay in close communication with their cruise line and sign up for text alerts to receive any notifications.\n\nAt this time, it is not expected that Invest 90-L will develop into an official tropical system in the next few days, though some minor development might occur early next week after the area of low pressure has moved back into the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "cruisehive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cruise Hive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melissa_mayntz@cruisehive.com",

That was the end of the dry conditions.\"\n\nThat's how Kevin Kodama, senior service hydrologist for the National Weather Service in Honolulu, summed up weather conditions for the month of May, traditionally the start of Hawaii's dry season.\n\n\"Big Island rainfall totals were near to above average at most of the rain gauges,\" Kodama said in his monthly precipitation report.\n\nHe described Honokaa as a \"notable outlier.\" The Hamakua hamlet got just 1.78 inches of rain in May, 27% of its average of 6.63 for the month.\n\nMuch of the heavy rainfall occurred on May 10 when strong midafternoon thunderstorms over the Hilo area generated rainfall rates of 3 to 4 inches per hour, causing flash flooding downtown and brief power outages.\n\nWhile the thunderstorms abated and moved offshore by sunset, heavy rainfall started by 9 p.m. that night over the South Kohala slopes. The showers moved slowly toward Puako and the Waikoloa Beach areas, with rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches between Waimea and Kawaihae.\n\nWaikoloa, almost always arid, ended up with 5.4 inches of rain for the month, more than five times its norm.\n\nAnother windward deluge occurred May 13, when 6.19 inches fell near Kurtistown.\n\nKona lows on May 18-19 and May 23 dropped rain on Oahu and Kauai, but had no major effect on the Big Island.\n\nHilo International Airport recorded 9.75 inches of rain in May, 139% of its norm. Piihonua, on the Mauna Loa slope above Hilo, received 22.21 inches, 165% of its May average. A total of 21.57 inches fell in Glenwood, in the upper Puna rainforest, 36% more than its usual May rainfall.\n\nIn Ka'u, Pahala had its highest May rainfall total since 1965, with 14.34 inches, while Kapapala Ranch's rainfall of 11.1 inches is its highest May total since 2002.\n\nThe Kona coffee belt, which has its wet season in the summer, recorded above average rainfall in all four of its official gauges.\n\nWaiaha had the most abundant rainfall in the region, 10.51 inches, more than twice its May norm. Kealakekua, Kainaliu and Honaunau received 9.39, 8.85 and 6 inches even, respectively.\n\nEven with mostly above average rainfall, much of perpetually dry North Kona remained so.\n\nEllison Onizuka Kona International Airport in Keauhou received almost twice its normal May rainfall, but that amounted to just 1.21 inches.\n\nKaloko-Honokohau tallied 1.67 inches, 95% of its norm, and 2.4 inches fell at Kaupulehu, 60% above norm.\n\nState officials held a press conference June 4 on Maui to reiterate that a drier-than-usual dry season has been forecast, as well as a deepening drought during the summer.\n\n\"Parts of south Maui and western Hawaii Island are already in severe drought conditions,\" said Mike Walker, the Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Forestry and Wildlife's fire protection forester.\n\n\"Much of the state received above-normal rainfall in April and in parts of May, but that didn't happen across the entire island chain,\" added Derek Wroe, a National Weather Service forecaster. \"So, parts of Maui and the Big Island have remained in drought. And as we move into the summertime ... the drought that's in place on Maui and the Big Island will likely worsen, and the drought will expand to all Hawaiian Islands.\"\n\nEmail John Burnett at

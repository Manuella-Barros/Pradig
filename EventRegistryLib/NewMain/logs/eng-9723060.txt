He was 46 years old.\n\nPer TMZ, Gregory was found deceased on June 13, though word of his passing is just now starting to hit the press. His death was confirmed by his sister, Rebecca, who shared that Gregory was discovered dead in car parked at a Chase Bank parking lot in Peoria, Arizona. Also found dead in the car was Gregory's service dog, Hans. The actor's cause of death is still pending, according to the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nWhile the cause of Gregory's death hasn't been confirmed, those close to him have offered a theory to TMZ. Rebecca said that Gregory suffered from depression, bipolar disorder, and a sleep disorder that would sometimes keep him awake for days at a time. It is believed that Gregory traveled to the bank to deposit residual checks before falling asleep in his car, with the ALF actor and his dog ultimately succumbing to vehicular heatstroke.\n\nGregory's sister has offered thanks and appreciation for the support the family has been receiving at this difficult time. For anyone looking to offer more help, she has suggested donations be made in Gregory's name to either The Actors Equity Foundation or the ASPCA, two causes that were important to the actor.\n\nGregory comes from a family of entertainers, as his father, uncle, and sister wer eall actors as well. His grandmother also served as his agent. As an actor, Gregory may be best known for playing middle child Brian Tanner on the 80s television series ALF. He appeared in more than 100 episodes on the show, which aired from 1986 to 1990.\n\nGregory was born on May 26, 1978. He'd go on to become a child star, and while ALF is his most well-known role, Gregory was also seen in several other big-name TV shows of the 1980s. This includes roles in The A-Team, Fantastic Max, Pound Puppies, Murphy Brown, Fantasy Island, T.J. Hooker, The Twilight Zone, Amazing Stories, and Mr. Boogedy.

It is believed that he succumbed to vehicular heatstroke as temperatures soared to 109 degrees on June 12. His service dog, Hans, was also found dead in the vehicle. May he rest in peace.\n\nThe Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office has stated that the cause of Gregory's death is still under investigation. His sister, Rebecca Hertzberg-Pfaffinger, disclosed to TMZ that Gregory had been struggling with depression, bipolar disorder, and a sleep disorder. These conditions often kept him awake for days. The possibility of these factors contributing to his untimely demise is being explored. His acting credits as a child artist also reportedly included The Twilight Zone and Pound Puppies.\n\nBorn Benjamin Gregory Hertzberg on May 26, 1978, in Los Angeles, California, Gregory hailed from a family of actors.

Over the course of 101 episodes in his role as Brian, he protected Lucky the cat from ALF's feline cravings and sang as an asparagus in a school play. During the '80s and '90s, Gregory took roles in several other shows and films, including The A-Team, Punky Brewster, The Twilight Zone, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and Fantastic Max.

TMZ reports that the former actor was found dead in his car in Arizona on June 13, according to his sister. The 46-year-old's cause of death is still pending, per the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office. However, his sister Rebecca told the outlet that Gregory had a sleep disorder \"that often kept him awake for days\" and also suffered from depression and bipolar disorder.\n\nIt's believed the former actor went to the bank to deposit residual checks on June 12, where he fell asleep in his car and died from heatstroke. Gregory wasn't the only one who was found, as his service dog Hans was with him and also died, likely from heatstroke.\n\nBorn on May 26, 1978 in Los Angeles, Gregory came from a family of actors. He made his acting debut in 1984 in single episodes of The A-Team and T.J. Hooker, also appearing in episodes of Punky Brewster, The Twilight Zone, and Amazing Stories before landing his breakout role of Brian Tanner in the NBC sci-fi comedy ALF in 1986. The series also starred Max Wright, Anne Schedeen, and Andrea Elson and ran for four seasons from 1986 to 1990.\n\nDuring his time on the series, he continued to act in other projects, such as Pound Puppies and Fantastic Max. After ALF, he appeared in Never Forget, Back to the Future TV series, and Once Upon a Forest, which was his final role in 1993. Gregory officially left the entertainment industry when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 2003 and graduated from school to be an aerographer's mate.

The famous actor was 46 years old. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office said Gregory's cause of death is unknown. A death certificate confirmed the date of his passing, according to TMZ. Rebeca said Gregory suffered from depression, bipolar disorder and a sleep disorder that often led to the star staying awake for several days at a time, according to TMZ.\n\nSources close to the actor said they believe he went to the bank to deposit residual checks June 12, and may have fallen asleep in his car. They believe he died from vehicular heatstroke due to Arizona's extreme summer heat, according to TMZ.\n\nGregory was found dead alongside his service dog Hans, who also died in the vehicle, according to TMZ.\n\nThe young actor catapulted to fame in the role of Brian Tanner on \"Alf.\" He appeared in 101 episodes of the show, which aired from 1986-1990.\n\nGregory picked up a few other acting jobs after \"Alf,\" but never found another role that matched that level of stardom or success. He left the entertainment industry behind in 2003 and enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He received an honorable medical discharge from the Navy in 2005, according to TMZ.\n\nRebecca has requested privacy on behalf of her family as they process their grief at this challenging time.\n\nShe added that the family would appreciate donations in Gregory's name to either The Actors Equity Foundation or the ASPCA, as those were causes that were near and dear to the talented star.

According to her, Benji was found dead in his car in the parking lot of a Chase Bank in Peoria, Arizona back on June 13.\n\nPer TMZ on Thursday morning, Rebecca believes that Benji went to the bank at some point on the previous day to deposit residual checks from his entertainment work. His family thinks that he then fell asleep in his car -- and tragically died hours later due to vehicular heat stroke in the blazing summer sunt of Arizona. Sadly, his service dog -- a pug named Hans (pictured above, inset) -- was also in the car with him, and the dog also perished. Benji was just 46 years old.\n\nRelated: Porn Star Jesse Jane's Official Cause Of Death Finally Revealed\n\nPer that news outlet, Rebecca revealed that her brother had suffered from bipolar disorder, depression, and a sleep disorder that would sometimes keep him awake for days at a time. That sleeping issue, and the exhaustion of falling asleep in his car leading to possible death from the heat, may have played a role in the tragedy. Officially, the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office says that his cause of death is still pending. Per People, the temperature in Peoria rose as high as 109 degrees on June 12.\n\nBenji's most high-profile gig was on the aforementioned sitcom ALF. He played the role of Brian Tanner on 101 episodes of the show between 1986 and 1990. He later left the entertainment industry, and in 2003, he enlisted in the US Navy. He graduated from a Navy training school to become an aerographer's mate while in the service, and later received an honorable medical discharge from that organization.\n\nGregory could have been soon to return to ALF fame in some form, as the show was in the development stages as a possible reboot in 2018. That eventually fell through, but in February of this year, Shout! Factory announced that it had acquired the rights to ALF and was trying to develop new content to build off the show's original run.\n\nWe are sending our most sincere condolences to Gregory's family, friends, and loved ones.\n\nR.I.P.\n\n[Image via Benji Gregory/Instagram/Instagram]", "source": {"uri": "perezhilton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perez Hilton"}, "authors": [{"uri": "perez_hilton@perezhilton.com", "name": "Perez Hilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benji_Gregory", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benji Gregory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ALF (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peoria, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peoria, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistance_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistance dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maricopa_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shout!_Factory", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shout!

Gregory was reportedly found deceased in his car in the parking lot of a Chase Bank in Peoria, AZ. Reports indicate that Gregory's service dog, Hans, was also found dead in the car. According to Rebecca, Gregory had depression, bipolar disorder, and a sleep disorder that often kept him awake for days. The cause of death has not been confirmed at this time, although his family reportedly believes it might have been vehicular heatstroke.\n\nGregory was born Benjamin Gregory Hertzberg on May 26, 1978 in Los Angeles, California, to a family of actors. He got his start in Hollywood by guest starring on shows such as The A-Team, T.J. Hooker, The Twilight Zone and Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. His big break arrived with the debut of ALF in 1986, as he ultimately played the role of middle child Brian Tanner for more than 100 episodes before the series finished its run in 1990.\n\nThe other role Gregory might have been best known-for was Dash, an orphan on the TV sitcom Punky Brewster. Gregory was set to be among the stars of a Punky Brewster spinoff series, Fenster Hall, but it did not get picked up for production. He also appeared on a slew of nonfiction children's television shows, including I'm Telling, Fun House, The Dating Game, and The More You Know. On the film side, Gregory made appearances in the 1986 spy comedy Jumpin' Jack Flash, as well as the 1993 animated movie Once Upon a Forest.\n\nGregory left the entertainment industry in the early 2000s, enlisting in the United States Navy in 2003 and serving as an aerographer's mate.

He passed away at 46.\n\nRebecca, Gregory's sister, disclosed to TMZ that his body was found on June 13 inside his car parked outside a Chase Bank in Peoria, Arizona. According to the report, family members believe he had been dropping off checks the previous day, possibly falling asleep in his car, and tragically succumbing to the heat. His service dog, Hans, was also discovered deceased in the vehicle.\n\nDeadline reported that Gregory's death has been confirmed by the Maricopa County Medical Examiner's office, although the exact cause remains undetermined. Rebecca further shared with the outlet that Gregory had been contending with depression, bipolar disorder, and a sleep disorder.\n\nCamille Jazzy Jenkins, a cousin of Gregory's, took to Facebook to pay tribute to the late actor. \"In complete sadness and shock our family has lost one of the most beloved and wonderful men in our small circle,\" Jenkins posted. She also cited \"heat exhaustion\" as the cause of death.\n\n\"It has taken some time to process and come to terms with our loss,\" the statement added. \"We are not okay.. but take comfort knowing he is with his grandmothers. Please keep his sister, brother and parents in prayer.\"\n\nRecent weeks in Arizona have seen extreme heat.

Gregory portrayed Brian Tanner, the family's son. His role on the show marked his final acting engagement. Subsequently, as reported by TMZ, he enlisted in the Navy and served until his honorable discharge in 2005.\n\nIn a 2022 YouTube interview on the BTM Legends Corner channel, Gregory elaborated further on his experience during his time on the sitcom.\n\n\"Actually, I don't really remember any moment or anything like that where I became aware of Alf being a big hit.

Hooker,\" as well as the 1986 Whoopi Goldberg movie \"Jumpin' Jack Flash.\"\n\nGregory also did voice-over work, appearing on \"Pound Puppies\" and \"Fantastic Max.\" After \"ALF\" ended, he provided the voice of Biff Jr. in the animated \"Back to the Future\" TV series. He also starred on an episode of the original \"Murphy Brown\" series, while his last credit was a voice role in the 1993 movie \"Once Upon a Forest.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benji_Gregory", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benji Gregory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ALF (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maricopa_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maricopa County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Max", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Max"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_Puppies_(2010_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Hooker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T.

Gregory was inside a vehicle at a Chase Bank location's parking lot in Peoria, Ariz., at the time his body was found on June 13, his sister said.\n\nGregory's service dog, Hans, was also inside the vehicle and was similarly found dead, TMZ reported.\n\nAs of Wednesday, officials hadn't yet determined Gregory's cause of death. However, people close to the late actor told TMZ that they suspected he fell asleep inside his vehicle as it was parked outside the bank and suffered heatstroke. Further details regarding the circumstances surrounding Gregory's death were not immediately available.\n\nGregory played Brian Tanner on ALF throughout the NBC sitcom's four seasons from 1986 to 1990. He also appeared in four TV specials linked to the fictional title character, an \"alien life form\" (or ALF) that found himself living with the Tanner family after traveling from his home planet to Earth.\n\nIn addition to his role on ALF, Gregory made appearances in several 1980s-era shows, including Murphy Brown, The A-Team, The Twilight Zone and Punky Brewster, among others. He also appeared in the 1986 film Jumpin' Jack Flash and voiced a character named Edgar in the 1993 animated film Once Upon a Forest.\n\nThose who wish to honor the late actor have been encouraged to make donations to The Actors Equity Foundation or to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), Gregory's sister told TMZ.\n\nNext: Remembering the Stars and Legends We've Lost In 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meghan_roos@postandcourier.com", "name": "Meghan Roos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benji_Gregory", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benji Gregory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ALF (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peoria, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Peoria, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punky_Brewster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punky Brewster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The A-Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Saga_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Twilight Saga (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumpin'_Jack_Flash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jumpin' Jack Flash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murphy Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors'_Equity_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Actors' Equity Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/2c/52c0c787-d100-52d9-9bcb-ccf585de4d17/668f30cde9d0c.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723060", "eventUri": "eng-9723060", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 177, "textEnd": 184}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

He was 46.\n\nBorn Benjamin Gregory Hertzberg in Los Angeles, CA, on May 26, 1978, Gregory was one of several actors in his family. Still, few could have predicted his sudden rise to prominence. Before his 10th birthday, Gregory had landed roles on several '80s hallmarks, such as The A-Team, T.J. Hooker Punky Brewster, and Amazing Stories. In 1986, he joined the cast of ALF as the cat-hunting, beer-swilling alien life form's best friend, Brian. Gregory was a patient and enthusiastic scene partner for his crass puppet co-star, bouncing off the furry extraterrestrial for four years and 101 episodes. He would later return for the 2004 reboot pilot.\n\nThroughout ALF's run, Gregory continued to work. He appeared on Murphy Brown and Whoopi Goldberg's screen breakthrough, Jumpin' Jack Flash. Gregory also dabbled in voice work, playing Biff Tannen Jr. in the second season of the Back To The Future cartoon series. By 1993, Gregory had all but left the industry. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 2003, becoming an Aerographer's Mate at The Center for Naval Education and Training Unit.

To commemorate Benji's memory, they've suggested that those looking to pay tribute could make a donation to either The Actors Equity Foundation or the ASPCA.\n\nWhile we're still waiting for an official statement from The Maricopa County Medical Examiner's Office, early reports suggest that the tragic event took place on the confirmed date of 13 June.

One fan voiced their sadness, \"Omg! That is crushing. So young.. why.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another shared their heartfelt dismay with the simple words, \"Tragic :(\".

Though his most recognized and celebrated work, Gregory also made several guest appearances in various TV shows during the 1980s and early 1990s, including \"The A-Team,\" \"T.J. Hooker,\" \"Fantasy Island\" and \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nBut his television stints weren't just limited to physical work.

Gregory also appeared as himself in the PSAs television series \"The More You Know,\" the children's game show series \"I'm Telling!\" and an episode of \"Fun House.\"\n\nAfter his early career in acting, Gregory stepped away from Hollywood and pursued other interests, including a stint in the U.S. Navy. He enlisted in 2003 and graduated to become an aerographer's mate, specializing in meteorology and oceanography. He used his expertise to provide forecasts and warnings for aviation and nautical safety.\n\nGregory was assigned to the USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) during his naval career. In 2005, he received an honorable medical discharge from the Navy and married Sarah Gregory shortly after completing his military service in 2006.\n\nBack in 2000, Gregory was interviewed by People, where he reflected on his work in \"Alf,\" saying, \"The only times it felt like work was when the lights were on, and it was real hot,\" he said, adding that he remembered \"climbing under the stage and messing around with the staff.\"\n\nThough he also noted it was a \"relief\" when \"Alf\" was canceled, as he no longer wanted to act, he also affirmed he \"didn't regret any of it.\"\n\nGregory was born in Encino, Calif., on May 26, 1978.

His body was found in a car with his dog Hans, who also did not survive.\n\nThe vehicle was parked near a bank building in Arizona. According to the Daily Mail, the star's body was found on June 13, but the cause of death has not yet been determined.\n\nBenji's sister shared with the media that her brother had many mental problems. Among them: were depression, bipolar disorder, and a sleep disorder that made the 46-year-old man stay awake for several days.\n\nThe star's family has its theory about the actor's death. They believe that on June 12, he went to the bank and fell asleep in the car.\n\nSince it was very hot that day, Benji's family members assumed that heatstroke was fatal for the driver. The medical examination has not yet established the cause of death, so it cannot confirm this theory.\n\nAs a child, Benji starred in many shows that became famous all over the world. He became the star of not only Alpha, but also appeared in the 1983 TV series The A-Team, The Twilight Zone, T.J.

He was fun to be around and made us laugh quite often.\n\n\"Still, going through his things, I find myself laughing at little videos or notes of his, in between crying.\"\n\nLaMotta was one of the Tanners' neighbours, playing Trevor Ochmonek.\n\nLaMotta won roles in many shows, including: Who's the Boss?, Growing Pains, Sinatra, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, ER, Fraiser, and The Nanny.\n\nHe also featured in films Pet Shop, Vampire in Brooklyn, Five Aces, The Godson, and Motel Blue.\n\nDespite its standing in sitcom history, he referred to ALF as the \"worst work I ever did\".\n\nHe died in 2014 aged 75.\n\nIn ALF, Sheridan was the wife of Trevor, named Raquel.\n\nSheridan enjoyed a long and highly successful career in TV and film after ALF - most known for her role in the legendary series Seinfeld.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_leonard@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Owen Leonard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALF_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ALF (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benji_Gregory", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benji Gregory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guest_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guest appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sheldon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young Sheldon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Simpsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judging_Amy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judging Amy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puppet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_Pains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Growing Pains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_&_Clark:_The_New_Adventures_of_Superman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nanny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Nanny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Back to the Future (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/newspress-collage-x24rhb6ol-1720695269777.jpg?1720699209&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9723060", "eventUri": "eng-9723060", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 2540, "textEnd": 2547}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

So enjoy it because we all think you're great, actually.\"\n\nStewart and Donna actually met in person at QVC's first-ever Age of Possibility summit in Las Vegas on April 24. Stewart hosted an event at her restaurant, The Bedford at the Paris Hotel. She shared a photo of them both smiling in the restaurant.\n\nDonna posted a photo at Stewart's establishment, sharing her favorite dishes and a picture of a colorful spring salad. \"Wonderful lunch at The Bedford by Martha Stewart - her restaurant in Las Vegas that didn't disappoint which looks like the inside of her home!\" she said, adding, \"The pierogies were amazing!\"\n\nAt the main event, Donna also spoke with PEOPLE about Swift's new album, The Tortured Poets Department.\n\n\"I listened to the whole album, and I listened to it all morning long when it was released,\" she said. \"I was just very impressed. She is a very talented woman, and I think it is probably her best work.\"\n\nSwift, 34, seemingly references her romance with Travis, also 34, on multiple tracks.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cookbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mother"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartRadio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IHeartRadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QVC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QVC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierogi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bedford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/jvJ9mu81ykDd5mcQ-bA-MxDayfE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(707x290:709x292)/Martha-Stewart-Taylor-Swift-Donna-Kelce-tout-050824-fc4a5b5025ee4f42885ae0de904059c7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1884, "textEnd": 1892}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

So we decided that we would be married throughout the entire time that the kids were in the house, and that's the way it worked out,\" Donna shared.\n\nStewart told Donna it was \"so smart and so lucky\" that she and Ed chose that path, agreeing that it is \"so hard\" to raise children alone and that it was also \"lucky\" for Travis, 34, and Jason, 36, to have their parents under the same roof until they moved out.\n\nDonna and Ed were married for nearly 25 years. They raised Travis and Jason in Cleveland Heights, Ohio before both of their sons played football at the nearby University of Cincinnati.\n\nThe couple first met when Donna was meant to go on a date with another man, they revealed on an episode of New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce.\n\nOn her way to the date, Donna stopped by a bar named Fagan's in Old Cleveland Flats, where Ed also happened to swing by for an after-work drink. The two got to talking and Donna never went to meet the other guy.\n\n\"I was supposed to go out with a guy that night. We were supposed to go to a play, and I never made it. Your dad and I talked forever,\" Donna told her sons on New Heights, adding jokingly, \"It was a good play, too! I really wanted to see it.\"\n\nAlso on her sons' popular podcast, Donna assured both Jason and Travis that she has no ill will toward their father and will always consider him a very important person in her life. \"I don't hate him. We're friends to this day. We get along great,\" Donna said on the podcast.\n\n\"We were like a tag team with you two. We got to do all sorts of fun things.

The special Mother's Day edition of the iHeartPodcasts series spotlighted a recent interview that the podcast's host, Martha Stewart, conducted with Donna ahead of this year's holiday.\n\nNear the end of their conversation, Stewart appeared somewhat hesitant to mention Swift, who has dominated headlines this year amid her ongoing international Eras Tour, her recent album release and her whirlwind romance with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. Still, the businesswoman mentioned how she had seen Donna seated near the \"Cruel Summer\" singer at Chiefs games during the 2023 NFL season as the two cheered for Travis together.\n\nRelated: Donna Kelce Reveals Whether Jason or Travis Spend Mother's Day With Her Each Year\n\n\"Well, you know, you never know.

Since those early days, the Grammy Award-winner and NFL star have gotten to know each other both at home and abroad as Kelce traveled to support Swift for some of her Eras Tour shows in Australia and Singapore.\n\nWhile the couple have recently enjoyed some quiet time together during Kelce's off-season and Swift's break from touring, the \"Lover\" singer is now gearing up for the launch of her tour's European leg.

It was then that she dove into her struggles to convince her father that she should pursue her athletic endeavors.\n\nJason and Travis Kelce's mother mentioned her father's \"preconceived notion\" about his daughter's future and that it didn't involve her playing sports. She then said that, with the help of her stepmother, she was able to pursue her love.\n\n\"I you know, he was old school and felt that I'd either be you know, a mother, a nurse, a teacher,\" Donna said. \"He just had these preconceived notions. And thank goodness, I had a stepmother growing up, and she was very good. She was an athlete herself, and she kind of helped me.\n\n\"You know, navigate that and let me do things that my dad might not have necessarily wanted.\"\n\nDonna Kelce then went on to say that she was a track and field athlete and made her way to the Junior Olympics. Donna said that, at the time, female athletes quit playing sports when they hit high school.\n\n\"I love track. I was really good at track and high jump. I was in the Junior Olympics,\" she added. \"And but you know, you get to a certain point in high school and a lot of girls quit, like around thirteen fourteen, and I'm hoping that that will change, and it has really it has changed over time.\"\n\nWhile her own athletic career may have been cut short, she is hopeful that it will continue to change, evolve and allow for growth in female sports.\n\n\"But I was doing, I was before night, title night, so there was no point for me to do it,\" Donna said. \"I couldn't go any further. So I did as much as I could. But it was intramural. It wasn't inner school.\"\n\nHer love of sports also helped raise two sons, Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce, who are both Super Bowl champions.\n\nTravis Kelce's mom, Donna, shares the qualities that best describe him\n\nWhile appearing on \"The Martha Stewart Podcast\", Donna Kelce was asked to describe qualities that best describe her youngest son, Travis Kelce. The mother-of-two went on to talk about his fashion choices and how they coincided with his personality.\n\n\"He's a fashionista,\" Donna said. \"He very important for image and what he looks like, but not so much to be perfect.

The Ohio native dished about the pair's romance on \"The Martha Stewart Podcast\" on Wednesday, May 8.\n\nWhen asked about what the couple's future holds, Donna, 71, teased, \"Time will tell.\" She then veered her response in a different direction by listing the positive attributes that Travis, 34, and Taylor, 34, share. \"I know that they're both friendly,\" Donna dished. \"They're both generous. They're both loving. They're both caring individuals.\"\n\nThe family matriarch has spent a considerable amount of time with Taylor amid the pop star's relationship with Travis. The women were first spotted in public together in September 2023 when Taylor attended her first Kansas City Chiefs game. She sat in a private box with Donna and some of Travis' other friends and loved ones.\n\nThroughout the rest of the season, the ladies were photographed chatting at various games. They also made their way down to the field together to congratulate Travis following the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February.\n\nIn April, Taylor dropped her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, and Donna gushed over the record following its release. \"I listened to it all morning long when it was released,\" she told People. \"She is a very talented woman, and I think it is probably her best work.\" She also admitted to being \"very impressed\" by the songs.\n\nFollowing a two-month hiatus, Taylor's Eras tour resumes on Thursday, May 9, in Paris, France. She arrived in Europe several days ahead of the show and has been keeping a low profile as she prepares to hit the stage again. Meanwhile, the NFL star stayed in the States and attended the Kentucky Derby on May 4 and the F1 Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, May 5.\n\nHowever, Travis previously confirmed that he would be supporting Taylor on the European leg of her tour as much as possible. She'll be playing shows across the continent all summer long, and while Travis is busy, he's proved his dedication to his girlfriend in the past. In February, he flew all the way to Australia for just two days in order to attend one of the Sydney shows. During a rare bye weekend from football in November 2023, he also spent just 48 hours in Argentina to see one of Taylor's performances.\n\nOf course, the singer has returned the favor, attending as many NFL games as possible during the 2023 season. She also showed up to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas just one day after playing several shows in Japan, and when Travis asked her why she wasn't more exhausted, she replied, \"Jet lag is a choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelcekelces-mom-reveals-what-he-has-in-common-with-taylor.jpg?crop=792px%2C107px%2C1801px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 248, "textEnd": 253}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1553, "textEnd": 1558}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1786, "textEnd": 1791}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1831, "textEnd": 1836}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Could Travis and Swift's relationship be the endgame?\n\nDonna answered diplomatically but optimistically, per Hello!, saying, \"You never know. Time will tell, but I know that they're both friendly. They're both generous. They're both loving. They're both caring individuals.\"\n\nStewart admitted that she had been told not to ask about Swift but did so anyway. She explained,\"I know I was begged not to mention Taylor Swift, but I just want to say, you always look so great with her in the box when she was at the games with you.\"\n\nDonna is not the only person to offer new insight on Swift and Travis this week. On the Like a Farmer podcast, Travis' Kansas City Chiefs teammate James Winchester also recounted the star tight end's behavior when Swift first attended a Chiefs game in September.\n\nSeeing Swift there, \"my first response was, 'That's pretty cool,' so I walked up to Trav in the game, and we were on the sideline, and I just said, 'Hey man, that's cool she's here,'\" Winchester recalled, via Entertainment Tonight. \"He's like, 'Wait, what do you mean? Did they put her up on the Jumbotron or something?'\n\n\"[I told Travis], 'Jay [White, the Chiefs' assistant equipment manager] just told me right there. That's awesome, man, good for you.' He's just kind of smiling, like, kind of blushing.\"\n\nSwift spoke to Time in December about how she and Kelce dated for months privately ahead of her going to a Chiefs game.\n\n\"This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" she said, referencing Travis' New Heights shout-out in July 2023. \"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game?

Martha Stewart posed that very question to Travis' mom Donna Kelce.\n\nMama Kelce, aka the unsung hero of the \"Tayvis\" romance, has become a celebrity in her own right -- long before she and Taylor Swift started looking thick as thieves in their box seats at Arrowhead Stadium during this past football season. Donna Kelce spoke on the Mother's Day episode of The Martha Stewart Podcast, touching ever-so-briefly on her younger son's girlfriend and playing it coy when it came to what the future may hold. In the mom's words:\n\nAfter nearly a year of being questioned about the couple, it's pretty clear that the Kelce family has become pretty good at commenting on the relationship without giving away too much private information, but it's sweet that Donna Kelce had such nice things to say about Taylor Swift as well as her son.\n\nSwifties have been convinced from the beginning that Travis Kelce is \"End Game\" for the singer, and despite the fact they've been together less than a year, engagement rumors have already rolled around. Travis' dad Ed Kelce had a hilarious response to a particularly wild prediction about the couple's future (which involved the Antichrist), and the tight end himself had some fun with the fans as he made a comment about diamonds on his and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast.\n\nEven Taylor Swift seemed to have forever in mind with some of the lyrics to \"So High School\" off of her new album that appear to mention Travis Kelce. The lyrics to the song seem to reference an old interview where Kelce played \"Kiss, Marry, Kill\" with Swift and two other singers, with the artist singing that she was \"bettin' on all three.\"\n\nOnly time will tell what the future holds for these two lovebirds romantically, but professionally their downtime is coming to an end. Taylor Swift's upcoming projects include the resumption of the Eras Tour in Paris -- so get ready for more surprise song reveals -- while Travis Kelce has joined the Ryan Murphy drama Grotesquerie, where he'll make his scripted TV debut.\n\nHopefully, however, once football season kicks off this fall, we'll see Taylor Swift resume her spot next to Donna Kelce in Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on \"the guy on the Chiefs.\" Until then, you can continue to stream Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) with a Disney+ subscription, and keep an eye on the 2024 TV schedule for Travis Kelce's upcoming projects.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heidi_venable@cinemablend.com", "name": "Heidi Venable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Murphy_(filmmaker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Murphy (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antichrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiss (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqsXVg8na4koakNqck5Xr9-1200-80.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

They're both caring individuals,\" she reflected.\n\n\"You never know,\" Donna added of the couple's possible future together. \"Time will tell.\"\n\nTaylor certainly has some big shoes to fill when it comes to becoming a Kelce daughter-in-law. Travis' older brother, recently retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, has been married to his wife, Kylie, for six years, and the couple shares three daughters: Wyatt, 4, Elliotte, 3, and Bennett, 1.\n\n\"[Jason] got so lucky. She is amazing,\" Donna raved of her daughter-in-law. \"Kylie is just one of a kind. I can't say enough things about her. She holds the house together and she is an amazing woman.\"\n\nHowever, it seems neither Kylie, nor Taylor, can help keep Donna's sons on track when it comes to remembering Mother's Day. She joked that while her boys are usually extremely devoted, the early May holiday tends to slip through the cracks.\n\n\"They always remember my birthday, and they're very generous at giving me gifts and things like that, trips and what have you, and taking care of Mom,\" Donna shared. \"I don't have anything that I can complain about.\"\n\n\"It's just that that's one of those days that's in the middle of May, they're on their off-season, they're traveling, they're at the Derby, they're doing things and on vacation and enjoying themselves,\" she noted with a laugh. \"I think it slips their mind and they're like, 'Oh, Jesus, Mother's Day, I better text my mom.'\"\n\nTravis was indeed in attendance at the Kentucky Derby this year -- though without Taylor on his arm. However, the event came just a few weeks after the pair stepped out in Las Vegas to attend a charity event hosted by Travis' Kansas City Chiefs' quarterback, Patrick Mahomes.\n\nAn eyewitness told ET at the time that Taylor and Travis walked into the gala \"holding hands and were affectionate all night.\"\n\nThe eyewitness added that throughout the night, there was \"lots of kissing and just overall happiness between them. The support is there for one another.\"\n\n\"The two seem to be in good spirits and definitely in love,\" said the eyewitness.\n\nNext up, Taylor is set to jet off to Portugal to restart her record-breaking Eras Tour at the end of the month. And while her and Travis' relationship is constantly being photographed, Donna told Martha Stewart that she highly doubts either of her sons would want to be in front of the cameras full-time, for example, on their own reality show.\n\n\"I don't think either one of them wants to do reality TV,\" the proud mother admitted. \"Travis did it a little bit in the very beginning of his career, but I think he decided that that's not something he really wants to do 24/7.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-02/GettyImages-1733740244.jpeg?h=f2404feb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

She said that Jason was \"very tenacious\" with a \"good work ethic.\" When she started on Travis, the first word out of her mouth was \"fashionista.\" She also said that he was \"very generous\" with a \"good heart,\" but that's not what we're focusing on today.\n\n\"He cares about image and what he looks like, but not so much to be perfect. It's more to put a smile on people's faces,\" Donna explained. \"He'll dress the way he needs to, but most of the time he's doing it to make people laugh or to talk.\" This prompted Stewart to ask if Travis was a show-off, to which Donna quickly replied, \"Yes!\"\n\nWell, this is all starting to make sense.

They're both loving. They're both caring individuals.\"\n\nThe family matriarch has spent a considerable amount of time with Taylor amid the pop star's relationship with Travis. The women were first spotted in public together in September 2023 when Taylor attended her first Kansas City Chiefs game. She sat in a private box with Donna and some of Travis' other friends and loved ones.\n\nThroughout the rest of the season, the ladies were photographed chatting at various games. They also made their way down to the field together to congratulate Travis following the Chiefs' Super Bowl win in February.\n\nIn April, Taylor dropped her 11th album, The Tortured Poets Department, and Donna gushed over the record following its release. \"I listened to it all morning long when it was released,\" she told People. \"She is a very talented woman, and I think it is probably her best work.\" She also admitted to being \"very impressed\" by the songs.\n\nFollowing a two-month hiatus, Taylor's Eras tour resumes on Thursday, May 9, in Paris, France. She arrived in Europe several days ahead of the show and has been keeping a low profile as she prepares to hit the stage again. Meanwhile, the NFL star stayed in the States and attended the Kentucky Derby on May 4 and the F1 Miami Grand Prix on Sunday, May 5.\n\nHowever, Travis previously confirmed that he would be supporting Taylor on the European leg of her tour as much as possible. She'll be playing shows across the continent all summer long, and while Travis is busy, he's proved his dedication to his girlfriend in the past. In February, he flew all the way to Australia for just two days in order to attend one of the Sydney shows. During a rare bye weekend from football in November 2023, he also spent just 48 hours in Argentina to see one of Taylor's performances.\n\nOf course, the singer has returned the favor, attending as many NFL games as possible during the 2023 season. She also showed up to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas just one day after playing several shows in Japan, and when Travis asked her why she wasn't more exhausted, she replied, \"Jet lag is a choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@kansas.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Hypnotism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Hypnotism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Shows", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/3pwf83/picture288430919/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/4c9e0e22-3999-4e8e-9bd4-f4f5425449b0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1297, "textEnd": 1302}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 1530, "textEnd": 1535}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1575, "textEnd": 1580}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

She gave Mother's Day gift ideas on the \"Today\" show and shared a family pie recipe with clothing retailer Chico's.\n\nA Mother's Day video she and Travis made for Helzberg Diamonds two years ago showing him giving her a diamond tennis necklace resurfaced in recent days.\n\nStewart asked her about everything from how many loaves of bread the athletic brothers ate when they were growing up (a lot) to why Travis was at the Kentucky Derby (a friend's horse was running) and how she gets along with Jason's wife, Kylie Kelce (\"Jason got lucky,\" she said. \"I can't say enough things about her.\")\n\nKelce said when media outlets wanted to interview her last year after Travis' Kansas City Chiefs and Jason's Philadelphia Eagles got into the Super Bowl, she consulted them first, kinda warning them that \"you know how open I am about things,\" she said.\n\n\"I said, is there anything you don't want me to talk about or that's restricted? They said nope, our life is an open book.\"\n\nBut, as she has said before, she told Stewart she does not \"understand why people want to listen to me or they tell me I'm like their mom. ... I don't understand it.\"\n\n\"Well, you are our mother of the year,\" Stewart said. \"I think it's just great. You should be so proud of yourself, not just for giving birth to two amazing boys but you have maintained a really lovely demeanor through this entire time.\"\n\nKelce met Stewart last month in Las Vegas, where they both appeared at an Age of Possibility summit of notable women over the age of 50, hosted by shopping network QVC.\n\nStewart hosted a lunch at her restaurant on the Vegas strip, The Bedford by Martha Stewart, and shared a photo of herself with Kelce.\n\nApparently Stewart was given instructions about certain topics to avoid during the podcast.\n\nBut come on. She's Martha Stewart.\n\n\"I know I was begged not to mention Taylor Swift, but I just want to say you always look so great with her in the box when she was at the games with you,\" Stewart said.\n\nShe told Kelce she's met Swift \"and she's lovely,\" she said. \"So good luck with that because that is some situation.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, you never know,\" Kelce said. \"Time will tell, but I know that they're both friendly. They're both generous. They're both loving. They're both caring individuals.\"\n\n\"And they're both adults,\" Stewart added.\n\nOn the topic at hand, she asked Kelce to describe three qualities about each of her sons.\n\nKelce said Jason, her oldest, is tenacious, has a good work ethic and is funny when the moment strikes him and \"then he's just as crazy as Travis is at times.\"\n\nShe described Travis as a fashionista, \"very important for image and what he looks like, but not so much to be perfect.\n\n\"It's more to put a smile on people's faces. ... Most of the time he's doing it to make people laugh or to talk, and he loves being the center of attention, which we all know that.\"\n\n\"So he's a show-off?\" Stewart said, sounding surprised.\n\n\"Yes he is,\" Kelce laughed. \"And he is very, very generous. Good heart.\"\n\nShe said when she looks at old family photos or movies, \"I see Travis always dancing or shaking his behind.\"\n\nShe said the brothers had played out in their minds when they were younger that they were going to somehow play in the Super Bowl together. \"It's just so weird that it came true,\" Kelce said. \"We didn't think it ever would.\"\n\n\"What were the most important values that you instilled in your boys and that stuck?\" Stewart also wanted to know.\n\n\"I think the importance of being loyal to your friends, that you be kind to everyone, that no matter if somebody's at school and it's the individual that's cleaning the toilets or if it's a principal or a teacher or somebody that has a disability, that you treat everyone equally and with respect. I think that's the most important thing,\" Kelce said.\n\n\"And if you see someone in trouble, help. If you see somebody that's being bullied or anything like that, try and step in and get in between that person, because they were big so they could make a difference and make sure that child was OK.\n\n\"So they did that a lot and sometimes they went a little crazy, and so I was in the principal's office and I'm like, look, they were helping this kid out who was being bullied, and I said I'll stand behind that every day of the week.\"\n\nStewart said she's looking forward to see what the Kelce sons do in the future. Jason retired at the end of the season and has a new job with ESPN, while Travis in the offseason has filmed a game show and this week filmed a part in Ryan Murphy's FX horror drama show, \"Grotesquerie.\"\n\n\"Would you say you're the Kardashians of sports? Maybe we'll see a sitcom with a bunch of you?\" Stewart teased.\n\n\"No, I don't think either wants to do reality. Travis did a little bit,\" Kelce said in an apparent reference to the dating show her youngest once did. \"But I think he decided that's not something he wants to do 24/7.\"\n\nInsert here the muffled cries of Swifties who follow the couple 24/7 anyway.", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_gutierrez@kansascity.com", "name": "Lisa Gutierrez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martha Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mother's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helzberg_Diamonds", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helzberg Diamonds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QVC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QVC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Murphy_(filmmaker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Murphy (filmmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Game show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FX (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_Up_with_the_Kardashians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Outdoors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/6iq1w6/picture287971930/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_5273.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551425", "eventUri": "eng-9551425", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

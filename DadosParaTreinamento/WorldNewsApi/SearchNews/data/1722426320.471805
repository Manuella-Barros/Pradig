He further asked Opposition leaders to resign from their positions as well. \u201cOpposition leaders should resign after bridges are submerged in water,\u201d he said. In the past 10 days, four other bridges have reportedly collapsed in Bihar. A major portion of a 182-metre newly-constructed bridge at Sikti in Bihar\u2019s Araria district collapsed last Tuesday. Another bridge, constructed at least 30 years ago, collapsed in Bihar\u2019s Siwan district making it the second such incident in a week. Further, a bridge caved in at the Kishangaj district this Thursday in the fourth incident of its kind in Bihar in just over a week, officials told news agency PTI. No casualties were reported in these incidents.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rjd-tejashwi-yadav-nda-bihar-bridge-collapse-9422086/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/PTI06_22_2024_000297B.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:19:25", "author": "Express Web Desk", "authors": ["Express Web Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.266}

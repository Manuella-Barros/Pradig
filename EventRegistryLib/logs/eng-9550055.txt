We want to strengthen those rents and have a long-term system of rent controls in Scotland.\n\n\"I know that the vested interests opposing that will be lobbying like mad - trying to get the government to water down that legislation.\n\n\"It's really important John Swinney and his colleagues make it very clear that there won't be a change in direction on measures so urgently needed.\"\n\nNikolas Skettos faced an increase of 25% on his monthly rent before he sought help from a tenants' union.\n\nHe and his parents received notice that his rent would soar from \u00a3726 per month - which they pay six months in advance - to \u00a3910 after the rent freeze was scrapped.\n\nBut Nikolas managed to bring the increase down to 12% after going through the government's adjudication process with the support of Living Rent.\n\nHe said: \"It's still a big increase but it will be a big weight off our shoulders. It would have meant less disposable income for our household.\n\n\"I hope they can change it so we're paying month-to-month rather than six months in advance.\"\n\nNikolas urges people who rent flats to join a tenants' union.\n\n\"I would encourage everyone to learn what their rights are - a lot of people don't and landlords are banking on that,\" he told STV News.\n\n\"We need to keep the rent reasonable. Collective action can make room for better change.\n\n\"I understand landlords want to put rent up every year due to inflation, but putting it up 50, 60% is unaffordable. My heart goes out to all these people affected.\"\n\nLiving Rent has urged Swinney to \"put his month where his mouth is\" to protect tenants' rights in Scotland.\n\nThe tenants' union is calling for a commitment to rent controls before the end of the parliamentary term.\n\nCampaigns chair Ruth Gilbert said: \"Private sector tenants are at the mercy of a completely unregulated sector with rent spiralling out of control and poverty going up.\n\n\"We need to see rent controls brought in as soon as possible.\"\n\nShe said figures estimate rent has gone up in Glasgow and Edinburgh by between 80 and 90% over the last decade - with tenants on the lowest income spending up to 50% of their pay packet on rent.\n\n\"We've got waves of members coming with astronomical rent increases,\" she said.\n\n\"We need to see something within the Bill to bring rents down. Local authorities are at their limit in terms of resources to deal with this.\n\n\"We've seen landlords chancing it.

A few Labour MPs signed the motion, despite Labour's leadership being accused of making a U-turn last year on their pledge to bring in rent controls.\n\nCurrently, the status quo of rents rising beyond what people can afford is unsustainable, so what have other places done to address the issue?\n\nGerman authorities brought in a nationwide Rent Control law, Mietpreisbremse, in 2015 which meant landlords couldn't extend rents by more than 10% above the rent index for that neighbourhood, which is set by the local government. If a landlord chooses to charge more than the permitted rent the tenant is eligible for a rent reduction.\n\nIt applies to high-demand urban areas such as Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt to address soaring rents and was recently extended through to 2029.\n\nSince 2019, in Paris and other big cities the rent control rule was toughened with a maximum rent ceiling. Rent in these areas can only be increased in line with inflationary increase in the rental index, with 28 regions of France now included in the rent control areas.\n\nDuring the cost of living crisis the government went further to fight the rising costs for households by capping property rent rises at 3.5 percent for a year in 2022.\n\nIn New York, there are rent controlled apartments that operate under the 'Maximum Base Rent (MBR) system which determines a maximum rent for each individual apartment, adjusted every two years.\n\nThere are both rent controlled flats and apartments under rent stabilization, with the later where a legal limit is imposed on how much a tenant can be charged in rent. This can only be increased by a percentage that is decided each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. Last year, this was by 3% for a one-year lease.\n\nRenting policies vary across Canada with a number of provinces having rent controls in place. In British Columbia, rent can only be increased according to the limits set in the Residential Tenancies Act, which calculated a maximum increase of 1.5% in 2022 and 2% in 2023.\n\nFurthermore, under the rules tenants must be given three full months notice of rent increases and landlords can only increase rent every 12 months. In Manitoba territory where a similar rent control policy is in place, there was also a rent freeze in 2022 and 2023 when landlords were forbidden to raise rents.\n\nEmergency legislation to temporarily cap rent in Scotland was introduced in September 2022. This imposed a 3% cap on all-tenancy rent increases in the private sector as well as protections against eviction. It was introduced by the SNP and Scottish Greens coalition in response to the cost of living crisis, however this ended on 31 March.\n\nUnder the legislation, private landlords could only increase rents for existing tenancies by 3%, or up to 6% if approved by a Rent Officer. Now the government has introduced a new process for tenants to challenge a rent increase if it's thought to be too high although there are fears tenants will now be hit by large rent increases.\n\nHowever the Scottish government is set to introduce the Housing (Scotland) Bill which would include a more long-term plan for rent controls.\n\n(Image Credit: Sludge G / Flickr)",

housing crisis call", "body": "There is expected to be pressure on new First Minister John Swinney to act on housing in the wake of the collapse of the Bute House Agreement and resignation of Humza Yousaf.\n\nThe change of leadership came after one of a number of contentious legislative elements was raised when the chief executive of a major Scottish housebuilder urged a Holyrood rethink on aspects such as rent controls.\n\nThis followed weeks of discontent around the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which I covered and have collated.\n\nShelter Scotland said \"housing must have its own seat at the Cabinet table\" with a Minister dedicated to the homes shortage crisis.\n\nSpringfield Properties revealed that it saw a major deal collapse on the day the Scottish Government introduced rent controls, while it is now estimated \u00a33 billion in wider built to rent investment is put at risk by formalising the policy.\n\n'Whilst introduced with good intentions, the intervention has had unintended consequences with private rents across Scotland soaring upon relet and investors exiting to redirect funds elsewhere,' said Innes Smith (Image: Springfield Properties)\n\nInnes Smith of the Elgin-based, London-listed firm told The Herald: \"The day the Scottish Government announced a rent freeze we immediately saw a deal to deliver 300 quality, energy efficient PRS (Private Rented Sector) houses collapse, and this investment has been lost.\n\n\"These homes were designed for families seeking homes to rent sustainably and would have eased pressure in areas of high housing demand including Inverness and Midlothian.\n\n\"This was planned as the first of many deals using private investment to enable an increase in housebuilding across multiple tenures.\"\n\nThe housebuilding companies who provide Scotland with the vast majority of its homes have collectively criticised plans for permanent rent controls and also questioned net zero targets related to new-builds after the Scottish Government changed its target.\n\nHomes for Scotland, the body representing around 200 companies which together provide most of the new homes built across the country, has also called for a review of the proposals and timescales after Holyrood abandoned its 75% emissions reduction by 2030.\n\nI have written a series of Business Week columns around issues housebuilders are raising with the Scottish Government around the Housing (Scotland) Bill, which has now been brought forward.\n\nTemporary rent controls introduced partly to help ease the cost of living during a crisis look likely to form a part of legislation, but the impact this is having on the build to rent market in Scotland is significant, according to industry insiders.\n\nIn response, Patrick Harvie, the Green MSP, then pointed to rent controls and investment in Europe, and said Holyrood is working with industry on future net zero regulations but seemed to remain firm on key points.\n\nThe backdrop is a growing housing crisis across the country, with four local authorities declaring emergency status because of the shortage of homes.\n\nI wrote that Scotland's housebuilders have warned the new SNP and Green Housing Bill risks \"serious unintended consequences\" amid concerns of investors walking away from funding homes in Scotland.\n\nHomes for Scotland said that \"levels of existing housing need in Scotland are more complex and much higher than is currently being accounted for\".\n\nA study found 28% of Scottish households, almost 700,000, currently have some form of housing need, including overcrowded households and those in need of affordable housing.\n\nThe study by Rettie and The Diffley Partnership was commissioned by Homes for Scotland, which has on its board key figures including Doug McLeod, Scotland director for Barratt Homes, Mr Smith of Springfield Properties, and Janice Russell, managing director of McTaggart Construction.\n\nJane Wood, chief executive of Homes for Scotland, said that \"it is unlikely this Bill will deliver the urgent action required to increase the number of much-needed homes that are required across all tenures\".\n\nShe said: \"There is nothing to support the under-resourced planning system which takes over 62 weeks to process a major housing application or improve the overall policy and regulatory environment which currently serves to hamper the delivery of new homes.\n\n\"It could also have serious unintended consequences given that the rent controls introduced in 2022 have resulted in investment in new homes being diverted to other parts of the UK, while rents here continue to spiral.\"\n\nI also revealed that the critical build to rent market in Scotland has been \"basically closed\" until there is more clarity around the SNP and Green administration's homes law.\n\nUnease around rent controls is growing to the extent the market has virtually drawn to a standstill in Scotland, a senior industry figure told The Herald, while construction and investment continue unabated south of the Border.\n\nThere is also a call for a review of new net zero laws impacting homes provision after the current Holyrood administration ditched its own emissions targets.\n\nHomes for Scotland wants the SNP and Greens to rethink the viability of net zero legislation from a housing delivery perspective.\n\nMr Harvie told The Herald: \"Our Housing Bill includes a package of important reforms to the rented sector that aim to improve affordability and strengthen tenants' rights. This includes the introduction of an effective system of rent controls in the private rent sector, which will improve affordability for tenants while recognising the importance of landlords investing in property quality.\n\n\"Our European neighbours have shown that rent control can be compatible with ongoing investment, and we will continue to engage with stakeholders from across the sector on delivering our commitment to introducing a longer-term system of rent controls for Scotland. Alongside this, we are committed to encouraging new and different approaches to attracting investment into our housing sector and the launch of our new Housing Investment Taskforce this month is an important step in that work.\"\n\nHe also said separately: \"We are currently undertaking a review of energy standards - engagement began in early 2023 and Homes for Scotland are a contributing member of the associated working group.\n\n\"We intend to consult on proposals in late summer, to support our commitment to Parliament to confirm any changes to regulations in December this year.\"",

But if her rent jumps up, she fears having nowhere to go.\n\nThe couple got a notice the rent for their two-bed flat would be rising by 12 per cent, from \u00a3940 to \u00a31,052.80 - which Jess says is completely unaffordable for them.\n\nShe explained how they received a notice from their letting agent earlier this year informing them of a three percent rise for the Newington flat. The couple agreed and signed the new tenancy. However, just a couple of weeks later, they were told that was scrapped and the landlord and agency would be back in touch in April regarding the rent.\n\nREAD NEXT-Edinburgh dad on how gambling addiction 'controlled and dictated' his life\n\nREAD NEXT-Edinburgh nurses told 'no time off' to attend funeral of much-loved colleague\n\nSpeaking to Edinburgh Live, Jess said: \"This is four times higher than the original increase. We got the notice on April 26 and submitted an appeal within 45 minutes. We weren't wasting any time.\n\n\"We were told it was in line with the market rates, but if the appeal doesn't go in our favour, I don't know what we would do. We can't stay here. It's over an extra \u00a3100 a month. It's not like we can just cancel subscriptions and deal with it, our money goes on rent, bills, food and that's it. We have nothing left.\n\nJoin Edinburgh Live's Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\n\"So we might have to leave. But where would we go? It would have to be friend's sofa. Our family don't live nearby or have a spare room for us. We'll be facing homelessness.\n\n\"I feel very let down and powerless. I've lived in Edinburgh for a decade and it's my home. I've made this flat my home, we've been allowed to decorate it and it makes me feel really angry if a rent rise forces us to leave.\n\nShe added: \"I'm worried but determined to win the appeal. I will even go to the tenant's union. I'm not going without a fight. But right now, we're just waiting to see what will happen.\"\n\nAccording to Spare Room, Edinburgh has the highest rent prices on average for one-bedroom flats. Latest data shows that the average for a one-bed in Scotland's capital city has hit \u00a3811. This makes Edinburgh the second highest area for rent with London and its suburbs coming out on top.\n\nThis comes as emergency legislation issuing a rent cap and eviction notice was lifted on April 1. According to the Scottish government website, if a tenant is concerned about the level of a proposed rent increase, they can raise it with their landlord or agent and apply to a rent officer at Rent Service Scotland, or to the First-tier Tribunal if applicable, for a rent adjudication.\n\nTenants with a 'Private Residential Tenancy' must do so within 21 days of receiving notice of the rent increase.\n\n\"All the responsibility falls on the tenant,\" Jess argued, \"it's a lot of stress for people in this position, especially if they are facing homelessness. The current situation is just sustainable.\"\n\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"Our temporary changes to the way rents are decided if a tenant seeks a review are helping to protect people from very steep in-tenancy rises, and tenants' rights in Scotland continue to be strongest in the UK.\n\n\"We are working hard to raise awareness of these rights, and we would encourage renters to check the rights that exist to protect them from unfair practices. Tenants who receive a rent increase that they are concerned about should apply to Rent Service Scotland for adjudication.\n\n\"The Housing Bill sets out our next steps on the path towards a fairer, well-regulated private rented sector. We will continue to engage with stakeholders from across the sector on delivering this commitment.\"\n\nAre you facing housing issues?

Election officials have 30 days to verify the signatures.\n\n\"We did it,\" Richmond City Councilman and ACCE member Melvin Willis told the small group gathered in front of City Hall. \"Now, with all these signatures, we are going to be able to get this on the ballot and folks who didn't have rental protections, eviction protections before ....they have a chance to actually assert the right not to be taken advantage of by people who are just looking at their housing as another price up in the stock market.\"\n\nPittsburg ACCE Action member Nicole Arrington, who is unable to work because she has cancer, has been campaigning for this proposed ballot measure since it was first introduced last year. She said she has no other options as attempts to persuade the City Council to introduce the measure have failed in the past.\n\n\"It's very necessary because unfortunately there are a lot of people here who have been evicted, and the majority of those people being evicted that I've seen personally are older Black women,\" she said at Wednesday's rally.\n\nState law already offers some protections, allowing rents to rise by 5% plus inflation with a cap at 10%, but many properties like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit building Arrington lives in are exempt.\n\nWillis and other housing advocates said the proposed Pittsburg Rent Stabilization and Tenant Protections Ordinance will ensure a 3% rent cap or up to 60% of the inflation rate based on the Consumer Price Index.\n\nSingle-family homes, condos and any unit built since 1995 would be exempt from the rent stabilization portion of the proposed rules and landlords would still be able to charge market-rate rent to new tenants.\n\nThe new rules, though, will also protect against unjust evictions, safeguard against harassment of tenants and ensure healthy living conditions, according to tenant organizers.\n\nLast year Arrington's rent was $1,700 - the same as her social security check, but working with her landlord, she was able to get it reduced to $940, which is still more than 30% of her income, she said. And she still must pay back the $16,000 she was unable to pay when her rent was higher, she said.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy that you live in a supposed income-based housing and they charge you more than what you get a month,\" Arrington said.\n\nContra Costa County has seen homelessness and housing prices grow over the past few years. According to RentCafe, approximately 59% of Pittsburg residents are renters who pay an average rent of $2,213.\n\nAdvocacy groups last month submitted the required signatures to get a similar ordinance before San Pablo voters, while a group in Larkspur turned theirs in on Monday. Advocates also expect petition signatures for rent control ordinances to be submitted in Redwood City and Delano later this month.\n\nThe Pittsburg effort follows successful ballot measure campaigns last year to increase tenant protections in Oakland and Richmond, both of which already had rent control. In Antioch and Petaluma, officials approved new limits on rent hikes for some tenants, and Antioch is working on a just cause ordinance. The Concord City Council, meanwhile, enabled rent stabilization and just cause eviction laws last month after a real estate broker failed to push forward a referendum petition to let voters decide.\n\nThe proposed ordinance in Pittsburg will likely see pushback from landlords and rental property associations who have said new regulations could hurt those still struggling from lost rental income during pandemic eviction moratoriums.\n\nEven so, housing advocates are determined to get rent stabilization and other protections in place, so tenants won't have to worry about big spikes in rent or unjust evictions.\n\n\"Our seniors, our kids, our families and disadvantaged Black and Brown low-income communities deserve to have stable, secure housing,\" Willis said.", "source": {"uri":

The complex is an affordable housing community owned by the nonprofit Volunteers of America. In early April, tenants received a letter informing them of a 15% increase beginning in June.\n\nAndrea Loudd, a resident of the complex for nine years, says this is a random and unfair increase that will put her in a tough position.\n\n\"I personally moved into this complex because I had a medical condition and I can no longer afford my home,\" said Loudd.\n\nLoudd has back problems and depends on a scooter to get around.\n\nMany residents at the complex are also dealing with medical conditions and are living paycheck to paycheck, since most of them are on Social Security and/or disability.\n\n\"I came here looking for something that my funds would cover,\" said Loudd.\n\nLoudd is now unsure she can afford rent at the complex after the rent increase that is set for June.\n\nShe tells CBS Colorado her Social Security disability insurance check comes in at less than $950 a month. Her rent is currently at $795 and by June it will increase to $914 due to a 15% increase set by the property.\n\nThis does not include utilities and other miscellaneous bills.\n\n\"Why would a humanitarian organization do this to the people they're supposed to be representing and taking care of?\" asked Loudd.\n\nState and federal regulators cap how much facilities like this can charge. Typically residents already see a 5% increase annually every time they recertify through the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority. The organization is responsible for ensuring the property complies with federal program requirements established by the IRS including rent and income restrictions.\n\nTo put things in perspective, the federal program regulations require housing tax credit supported properties like the La Casa De Rosal apartments to lease apartments according to the rent and income limits established by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nAccording to Denver's Department of Housing Stability's mandatory housing affordable limits, in Denver at a 50% area median income, a tax credit property can charge up to $1,396 for a two-bedroom residence.\n\nAlthough Loudd is being charged hundreds less than that, she says the increase is still inconvenient.\n\n\"I felt betrayed,\" said Loudd, \"I am thinking I am working with this organization who is supposed to offset these type of crisis, is supposed to be there for seniors who live on a fixed income.\"\n\nSeniors like Richard Contreraz can't afford it right now.\n\n\"I don't want to be in that situation. .. . I've been homeless before and I don't want to be in that situation,\" said Contreraz.\n\nWith the new increase, Contreraz says he will be spending almost 90% of his income on rent. After all his medical bills, utilities and rent, he says he will be left with about $50 each month.\n\n\"This is a joke, if they can get away with this then they're going to get away with everything else,\" said Contreraz.\n\nIn a statement to CBS Colorado, Peter Desjardins, the chief of real estate operations with Volunteers of America National Services, said the following:\n\n\"We understand there are concerns regarding a rent increase at Casa de Rosal Apartments. As an organization, we are discussing the possibility of implementing this in a phased approach to avoid placing an undue burden on the residents. The rent increase is necessary to ensure we can continue providing a safe, well-maintained, and operational living environment for our residents.\"\n\nAccording to the organization, these conversations are in the beginning stages and \"no specifics have been determined and/or implemented at this time.\"\n\nThe VOA emphasizes they understand the residents' concerns about a rent increase and are considering a path forward that will not place a burden on residents.\n\nHowever, Loudd is not convinced and is hoping the organization changes their mind.\n\n\"You're given millions of donations to help, not hurt, but now you're hurting and you're still receiving millions of donations,\" said Loudd.\n\nThe Colorado Housing and Finance Authority which supported the development of the building with an allocation of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits says when new rent and income limits are published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development each year, it is within the property owner/manager's choice to align to the new rent limits at the time of lease renewal.\n\nCHFA offers a Tenant Hotline (303.297.7442) for residents and is available to speak with tenants of Casa de Rosal regarding any concerns they would like to discuss, including those related to rent increases.\n\n\"We would welcome the opportunity to connect to help ensure that any increases are in accordance with the program guidelines,\" said Matt Lynn with the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteers_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volunteers of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/09/26404655-da1a-458f-a102-55caada0aa48/thumbnail/1200x630/bec0e656ba897f70b050667c785f1c67/housing2.jpg?v=218688c1357f974b9630d4fa8914721c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550055", "eventUri": "eng-9550055", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 452988474, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 10, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 10}}}

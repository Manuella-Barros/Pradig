The show, which dramatises the true story of how Gadd was stalked after he gave a forlorn punter a free cup of tea in the pub, is on track to become one of Netflix's most popular series of all time, clocking up 68.4 million views in April, making it the most-watched show despite only launching in the middle of the month (11th April). It has not been without controversy though. Shortly after the series landed on the streaming platform, its makers, including Gadd, came under scrutiny as viewers frantically took to social media to identify the real 'Martha'. Nonetheless, the series is likely to be in the top 10 most watched Netflix shows ever. Now, the streaming giant's CEO Ted Sarandos has reflected on why the drama, which was written by Gadd, has become such a huge hit with audiences around the world. He credited Gadd's ability to tell his story with 'authenticity', as well as the streaming format and the algorithm, with the seven-part series' phenomenal success. Baby Reindeer, written by Richard Gadd, is on track to become one of Netflix 's most popular series of all time Martha, the fictionalised version of Richard Gadd's real life stalker, was played by Yorkshire-born actress Jessica Gunning (pictured) Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos thinks Baby Reindeer's success is down to a technical reason But Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos thinks Baby Reindeer's success is also down to a more technical reason, helped largely by the format of the streaming giant, helping shows to reach global audiences. 'There was a time when something like Baby Reindeer would not even be seen in the United States,' Sarandos told The New York Times. 'And if it did, it'd be on PBS once. It's very, very big in the UK, and in that way that Netflix does, it gets picked up in the algorithm and starts getting more and more presented, because when something gets that big in one country, it's likely there's a lot of audience for it outside of that country. And it's been an enormous hit around the world.' Sarandos went on to say that 'authenticity' is key when it comes to attracting international audiences. He continued: 'What it's pushing is: You don't have to adapt your storytelling to America to work. If your movie, if your film works, if your TV series works in the home country, it's got to be very authentic. The seven-part limited series is an an adaption of Gadd's one-man stage play, which debuted at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2019 In the show we meet Donny Dunn (played by Gadd) whose chance meeting with a woman called Martha (played by Jessica Gunning) leads to a stalking ordeal 'And I think what international audiences pick up on is that authenticity. When you try to engineer something to travel, it really appeals to no one. I can't think of anything that we've done that has been engineered to travel that actually did travel.' Baby Reindeer is certainly authentic, showcasing familiar locations, such as the fictional London pub thought to be based on Hawley Arms in London, and staying true to the events that unfolded in writer Richard's own life. 'It's a true story,' Gadd told Netflix's Tudum: 'In a weird way, I first started feeling like this could be a good story during the whole ordeal itself. It was one of the most intense periods, when I was listening to these voicemails. 'I'd go to sleep at night and these voicemails \u2014 her words would bounce around my eyelids. I remember thinking: God, if I was ever to speak about this onstage, I'd fire the words around. Put the voicemails in a big cacophony and fire it. That's how the play was born.' As Baby Reindeer's popularity snowballed, fans began to search for the real-life inspirations behind the show's notorious characters. Those in the public eye added fuel to the fire, with numerous discussing the identities on TV shows, radio programmes and podcasts. On his podcast, The Rest Is Entertainment, Osman told co-host journalist Marina Hyde that 'everyone knows who he [Gadd] is talking about' in reference to the comedian's abuse from a well-known comedy producer. He said: 'As you say, there's a very, very serious thing that happens with a male comedy producer and Richard Gadd, who, as you say, did the show in Edinburgh and has been very open to people in the industry about who that person was, so people in the industry know who that person was.' The show continues to be a big talking point, prompting comments from celebrities such as Lily Allen, who has also spoken out about her own experiences of stalking. Allen believes that the man-stalked-by-woman dynamic means the show was given the platform in the fist place. 'I find it interesting that Baby Reindeer has landed so massively.' Lily told The Sunday Times Style. 'I feel like if it had been a female protagonist it wouldn't have got green-lit.' She continued: 'People will not be remotely as interested in a woman's story, which is arguably more common than a male story.'

dramatic early morning raid, some 60 miles south of Barcelona, followed a tip-off by gardai.\n\nThe 34-year-old north inner city hood, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested over the 2010 murder of Eamon 'The Don' Dunne.\n\nThe senior cartel player was previously arrested in relation to the murder but was never charged.\n\nHowever, he is facing serious charges that were brought against him after Dunne was gunned down at The Fassaugh House pub in Cabra.\n\nThe cartel criminal spent a number of weeks in jail before getting bail and fleeing Ireland almost seven years ago.\n\nIt is understood that when he arrived in Spain he hooked up with his associates in the Kinahan cartel.\n\nA European Arrest Warrant was issued for his arrest in relation to the serious charges he faces here.\n\nGardai have been hunting the major league gangster for more than two years.\n\nThe manhunt came to an end early yesterday morning when Spanish police, operating on vital information given to them by gardai, stormed a hotel room in Tarragona, a port city on the Costa Dorada.\n\nSecret\n\nIt is believed an Irish woman was in the room with the gangster when police burst in.\n\nThey were armed with machine guns and wore military fatigues in the top secret operation.\n\nIt is understood the gangster - who is believed to have been previously based in the Kinahan stronghold of Marbella on the Costa del Sol - was on holiday when he was arrested.\n\nThe feared thug is expected to be brought before a court in Madrid today, when he will be asked if he agrees to his extradition to Ireland.\n\nIf he agrees, he will appear before the courts here before the end of the month.\n\nIf extradited, he will probably be jailed in the so-called 'Kinahan wing' of Mountjoy Prison, where many of his associates are housed, some of whom face trial for feud- related crimes.\n\nHowever, if he contests the extradition arrest warrant, he can expect to face many months in a hell-hole prison while his case is dealt with by Spanish courts.\n\n\"Either way, whatever he decides to do, he will be in jail for a long time,\" said a source last night.\n\n\"This is considered a good thing because of his key involvement in the Kinahan cartel.\n\n\"Gardai have been hunting this man for a number of years and are delighted with the brilliant co-operation they have received from the authorities in Spain.\"\n\nThe mobster is considered a \"trusted\" member of the international crime syndicate, with access to large amounts of cash.\n\nHe is believed to have used a number of aliases since he went on the run and is wanted by other European police forces in relation to separate crimes.\n\nThe north inner city flats where he lived are now the focus of heavily-armed garda checkpoints as officers try to keep a lid on the long-running, bitter gangland feud between the Kinahans and the Hutch mob.\n\nThe ongoing war between the two criminal gangs has already claimed 12 lives.\n\nRobbery\n\nThe arrested criminal is a close associate of Barry Finnegan (38), another key cartel associate and a criminal who was also arrested in connection with the murder of Eamon Dunne.\n\nIt is believed Dunne was killed because the murders he was involved in were attracting too much garda attention to the cartel's crime network.\n\nDunne was a major crime figure, having assumed control of the Finglas-based drugs and armed operation previously led by Martin 'Marlo' Hyland.\n\nHis gang was a major importer of drugs, supplying them to smaller operations throughout the country, and is suspected of being involved in up to 15 gangland killings before his murder by the cartel.", "timeCrawl": "02:26:00", "sim": 0.8784313797950745, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date":

them by gardai, stormed a hotel room in Tarragona, a port city on the Costa Dorada.\n\nIt is believed an Irish woman was in the room with the gangster when police burst in.\n\nThey were armed with machine guns and wore military fatigues in the top secret operation.\n\nIt is understood the gangster - who is believed to have been previously based in the Kinahan stronghold of Marbella on the Costa del Sol - was on holiday when he was arrested.\n\nThe feared thug is expected to be brought before a court in Madrid today, when he will be asked if he agrees to his extradition to Ireland.\n\nIf he agrees, he will appear before the courts here before the end of the month.\n\nIf extradited, he will probably be jailed in the so-called 'Kinahan wing' of Mountjoy Prison, where many of his associates are housed, some of whom face trial for feudrelated crimes.\n\nHowever, if he contests the extradition arrest warrant, he can expect to face many months in a hell-hole prison while his case is dealt with by Spanish courts.\n\n\"Either way, whatever he decides to do, he will be in jail for a long time,\" said a source last night.\n\n\"This is considered a good thing because of his key involvement in the Kinahan cartel. \"Gardai have been hunting this man for a number of years and are delighted with the brilliant co-operation they have received from the authorities in Spain.\"\n\nThe mobster is considered a \"trusted\" member of the international crime syndicate, with access to large amounts of cash.\n\nHe is believed to have used a number of aliases since he went on the run and is wanted by other European police forces in relation to separate crimes.\n\nThe north inner city flats where he lived are now the focus of heavily-armed garda checkpoints as officers try to keep a lid on the long-running, bitter gangland feud between the Kinahans and the Hutch mob.\n\nThe ongoing war between the two criminal gangs has already claimed 12 lives.\n\nThe arrested criminal is a close associate of Barry Finnegan (38), another key cartel associate and a criminal who was also arrested in connection with the murder of Eamon Dunne.\n\nIt is believed Dunne was killed because the murders he was involved in were attracting too much garda attention to the cartel's crime network.\n\nDunne was a major crime figure, having assumed control of the Finglas-based drugs and armed operation previously led by Martin 'Marlo' Hyland.\n\nHis gang was a major importer of drugs, supplying them to smaller operations throughout the country, and is suspected of being involved in up to 15 gangland killings before his murder by the cartel.", "timeCrawl": "09:08:00", "sim": 0.8784313797950745, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8356065",

cartel.\n\nThe Irishman was fast asleep beside an unidentified woman at the hotel in Costa Dorada resort of Salou, 60 miles south of Barcelona, when he was met with a rude awakening.\n\nFootage released by police showed the elite team - carrying semi-automatic weapons with flashlights - running into the room after getting radio orders to strike as colleagues went in through a back terrace.\n\nThey can be heard shouting in Spanish, 'Las Manos, Las Manos' - English for 'Hands up, hands up' before yelling in English, 'Don't Move'.\n\nThe 34-year-old Irishman, wanted on weapons and drugs charges, is a suspect in the 2010 murder of gang boss Eamon 'The Don' Dunne.\n\nHe was driven to Madrid after his arrest for an extradition hearing before being forced back to Ireland.\n\nSpanish police revealed they had come close to catching the wanted 'major league' gangster in November last year at Malaga airport, but he escaped after crossing a busy motorway.\n\nThe European Arrest Warrant was issued after two guns and cocaine were found in his car during a 2013 search.\n\nThe fugitive is also understood to be facing serious charges over the gunning down of Dunne at a friend's birthday party at a pub in Cabra, Dublin in April 2010.\n\nThe gangland boss was sitting on a bar stool when a man calmly walked in and told other terrified customers to 'get on the floor' before blasting him with two shots to the head and three to his vital organs.\n\nA Spanish police spokesman, confirming the Costa Dorada hotel arrest and identifying the detainee only by his initials, said: \"Spanish National Police officers have arrested an Irishman born in 1982 on foot of a European Arrest warrant at his hotel in Salou near Tarragona.\n\n\"The warrant was issued by Irish authorities for illegal possession of firearms and drugs offences, relating to a search on the suspect's vehicle in 2013 in which Garda found two loaded guns and cocaine.\n\n\"Investigators were made aware that the fugitive had left Ireland to head to Spain in May 2016 using a a passport issued by the Irish authorities which he had in a false name.\n\n\"Efforts to locate him centred on the province of Malaga due to his alleged links to the Kinahan organised Irish crime family.\"\n\nThe spokesman, revealing how the suspect narrowly avoided capture in November last year, added: \"Subsequently it was discovered several members of his family were due to travel to Malaga and a surveillance operation was set up on Spanish soil, thanks to which he was located with his family at Malaga Airport.\n\n\"He reacted with great violence against officers who went to arrest him and fled, crossing several lanes of a motorway before managing to escape.\"\n\nThe Irishman had checked into the hotel in Salou using a false identity. His detention was the work of Special Operations Group GEO officers based in Catalunya who are often called on to rescue hostages or take out terrorists.\n\nThe Dublin-based Kinahan crime family, which is well established on the Costa del Sol, is regarded as one of Europe's leading crime syndicates.\n\nThey have ties to Colombian and Mexican cartels as well as the Russian mafia and are said to control most of the drugs smuggling into Ireland and the UK.", "timeCrawl": "16:25:00", "sim": 0.8274509906768799, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2010-04-", "textStart": 1472, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1482}, {"date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 2260, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2268}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8816458", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "id": 458, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International", "id": 556, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

dramatic moment a senior member of the international Kinahan crime cartel is arrested in his Spanish hotel bed.\n\nArmed officers held the Irishman after storming his room as he was fast asleep beside an unidentified woman at the hotel in the Costa Dorada resort of Salou 60 miles south of Barcelona.\n\nFootage released by police showed the elite team - carrying semi-automatic weapons with flashlights on them - running into the room after getting radio orders to strike as colleagues went in through a back terrace.\n\nThey can be heard shouting in Spanish, 'Las Manos, Las Manos' - English for 'Hands up, hands up' before yelling in English, 'Don't Move'.\n\nThe 34-year-old Irishman, wanted on a number of charges, appeared to be asleep at the time although the television in his hotel room was still on.\n\nThe fugitive, also a suspect in the 2010 murder of gang boss Eamon 'The Don' Dunne who cannot be named for legal reasons, was driven to Madrid after his arrest for an extradition hearing.\n\nIt was not immediately clear today if he had consented to extradition or opposed his forced return to Ireland.\n\nThe hotel where the arrest took place has not been named.\n\nSpanish police revealed they had come close to catching the wanted 'major league' gangster in November last year at Malaga airport.\n\nHe escaped after crossing a busy motorway as officers closed in on him when he went to meet relatives arriving from Ireland.\n\nThe European Arrest Warrant was issued after a search of his car in 2013.\n\nThe 34-year-old was arrested over the 2010 murder of Eamon 'The Don' Dunne.\n\nThe senior cartel player was previously arrested in relation to the murder but was never charged.\n\nHowever, he is facing serious charges that were brought against him after Dunne was gunned down at The Fassaugh House pub in Cabra.\n\nA Spanish police spokesman, confirming the Costa Dorada hotel arrest and identifying the detainee only by his initials, said: \"Spanish National Police officers have arrested an Irishman born in 1982 on foot of a European Arrest warrant at his hotel in Salou near Tarragona.\n\n\"Efforts to locate him centred on the province of Malaga due to his alleged links to the Kinahan organised Irish crime family,\" he added.\n\nThe spokesman, revealing how the suspect narrowly avoided capture in November last year, added: \"Subsequently it was discovered several members of his family were due to travel to Malaga and a surveillance operation was set up on Spanish soil, thanks to which he was located with his family at Malaga Airport.\n\n\"He reacted with great violence against officers who went to arrest him and fled, crossing several lanes of a motorway before managing to escape.\"\n\nThe Irishman had checked into the hotel in Salou using a false identity. His detention was the work of Special Operations Group GEO officers based in Catalunya who are often called on to rescue hostages or take out terrorists.", "timeCrawl": "11:38:00", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8785185", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "id": 203, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/International", "id": 556, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

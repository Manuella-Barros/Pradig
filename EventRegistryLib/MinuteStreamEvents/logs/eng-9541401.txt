Cleveland has an open space on its 40-man roster to add Manzardo, and the 26-man space will be created when outfielder Steven Kwan is placed on the 10-day injured list.\n\nKwan left Saturday's game due to hamstring tightness and was set to undergo an MRI today. The results of the tests aren't yet known, but even if the MRI is clean, the Guards might've felt it necessary to sideline Kwan anyway given his long history of hamstring problems. As Kwan explained to reporters (including Paul Hoynes of the Cleveland Plain Dealer) yesterday, he has battled hamstring issues both in the minors and during his college days.\n\nLosing Kwan for any amount of time is a blow to the Guardians, as his huge early-season performance has fueled Cleveland's rise to first place in the AL Central. Kwan is hitting .353/.407/.496 over 145 plate appearances, leading the American League in both batting average and hits (47). Some regression is inevitable since Kwan has a .370 BABIP and has continued to make some of the weakest contact of any hitter in baseball, but the Guards were happy to ride that offensive wave for as long as possible. In addition to this surge at the plate, Kwan has also been delivering his customary superb left field defense, and looks like a favorite to win his third straight Gold Glove.\n\nWill Brennan got the start in left field today, but the Guardians will probably keep the Brennan/Ramon Laureano platoon going in right field and address Kwan's absence by using Estevan Florial a bit more regularly in left. Florial has gotten the bulk of DH at-bats for Cleveland this season, yet the team will now need the designated hitter spot as a way to get Manzardo (who only plays first base) and Josh Naylor in the lineup at the same time. Gabriel Arias and David Fry also figure to get some playing time in the corner outfield in certain situations.\n\nA second-round pick for the Rays in the 2021 draft, Manzardo came to Cleveland at last year's trade deadline in the one-for-one swap that sent Aaron Civale to Tampa Bay. Manzardo's minor league numbers had already drawn him top-100 prospect attention prior to the trade, and he has only gotten better since joining the Guardians organization. Manzardo is hitting .303/.375/.642 with nine home runs over 128 PA with Triple-A Columbus this season, and while the Guards chose to start him at Triple-A rather than add him to their Opening Day roster, it only seemed like a matter of time before Manzardo made his MLB debut.\n\nMLB Pipeline ranked Manzardo 52nd on its list of the sport's top 100 prospects, and Baseball America has him 87th. (For lists released prior to the season, The Athletic's Keith Law ranked Manzardo 66th and ESPN's Kiley McDaniel had him 83rd.) The consensus is clear -- Manzardo's bat is definitely ready for the big leagues, though the 23-year-old might already be ticketed for a DH-only future even in a world where Cleveland didn't have Naylor locking down first base. Manzardo is viewed as a decent first baseman at best, and his lack of speed makes him an implausible choice to play outfield.\n\nAt the plate, however, Manzardo is a threat. He both makes a lot of hard contact and a lot of contact in general, befitting the Guardians' preference for hitters who rarely strike out. Manzardo has 50 home runs over his 990 PA in the minors, and there is some sense that he might be able to unlock more power given how well-developed his approach is in the batter's box.\n\nThis is music to the ears of a Guardians team that has long been lacking in power, though Cleveland's offense has been greatly improved in the early going this season. Naylor has been a big contributor to that more dangerous lineup, but since Naylor is a free agent after the 2025 season, there has been a sense that Manzardo might well be the heir apparent at first base. Cleveland's history of trading pricier players prior to free agency could make Naylor a big trade chip this coming offseason, so while a nice showing from Manzardo in his rookie season would certainly help the Guardians' chances in 2024, it might have the Catch-22 of also hastening Naylor's eventual departure.\n\nEven if he stays on the Guards' roster for the rest of the season, Manzardo won't earn quite enough service time for a full season of MLB service. As a result, he wouldn't garner the Guardians an extra draft pick under the Prospect Promotion Incentive even if he had a top-two finish in Rookie Of The Year voting. It is possible Manzardo might earn Super Two status and an extra year of arbitration eligibility if he garners enough service time over his first three seasons, though we won't know that answer until the 2026 season is complete.", "source": {"uri": "mlbtraderumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MLB Trade Rumors"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_polishuk@mlbtraderumors.com", "name": "Mark Polishuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2024/05/KyleManzardo-Vertical-200x300.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541401", "eventUri": "eng-9541401", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

An MRI revealed an acute strain and the Guardians said Kwan likely will be out for up to one month.\n\nKwan said he had hamstring issues while playing at Oregon State and in the minors.\n\nHis injury is a blow to the AL Central-leading Guardians, but it's giving the team a chance to promote hard-hitting prospect Kyle Manzardo, who has been bashing minor league pitchers this season and will now join a Cleveland lineup that can use some middle muscle.\n\nThe Guardians have been one of the season's early surprise teams -- they're 22-12 heading into their series opener against Detroit -- with Kwan a big reason for the club's fast start.\n\nHe seems to start or be in the middle of virtually every rally, and the 26-year-old Kwan continues to be one of the league's best defensive outfielders. Last year, he won his second straight Gold Glove.\n\nManzardo's reputation as a slugger preceded his arrival in Cleveland.\n\nThe 23-year-old was acquired at last year's trade deadline from Tampa Bay for pitcher Aaron Civale. The Rays were reluctant to part with Manzardo but they needed pitching while the Guardians have been craving a big bat in the middle of their order.\n\nManzardo had a strong spring for the Guardians, who had him start the season at Triple-A Columbus to build confidence. He's done just that, hitting .303 with nine homers, 10 doubles and 20 RBIs in 29 games.\n\nCleveland fans have been clamoring for Manzardo, who will be the club's DH and bat seventh in the series opener against the Tigers and is expected to get some playing time at first base. Manager Stephen Vogt has inserted Estevan Florial in Kwan's leadoff spot.\n\nAlso, the Guardians activated left-hander Sam Hentges from the injured list. The reliever has been out since training camp with a middle finger issue.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Vogt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Vogt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Spotters", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/preview-487.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541401", "eventUri": "eng-9541401", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

First base prospect Kyle Manzardo was certainly doing this part. According to several reports on May 5, he will finally get the call. However, it will come at the expense of the Guardians' best hitter so far in 2024, Steven Kwan, going on the injured list with a hamstring issue he incurred May 4.\n\nMore information will be known about the extent of Kwan's hamstring injury on May 6. But the Guardians have an open spot on their 40-man roster after designating right-handed pitcher Tyler Beede for assignment on May 3.\n\nOn the year, Manzardo is hitting .303/.375/.642 with 10 homers and nine RBI for Triple-A Columbus. Just this past week, Manzardo hit two homers off of left-handed pitchers, his first two of the year, bringing his line against southpaws to .296/.333/.630 in 30 plate appearances in 2024. In 2023, Manzardo hit .159/.267/.327 vs. left-handed pitching in 131 plate appearances.\n\nManzardo came to the Guardians from the Tampa Bay Rays at the 2023 trading deadline for right-handed pitcher Aaron Cviale. At the time of the trade, Manzardo was dealing with a shoulder injury, but returned to hit .256/.358/.590 with six homers in 92 plate appearances for Columbus. He also added 103 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League last September-November, hitting .272/.340/.565 with six homers.\n\nA second-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 2021 draft out of Washington State, Manzardo is limited to first base and DH, which played a role in not being called up before now, as the Guardians have Josh Naylor at first base, and have rotated the DH role so far to get more players at-bats and find out more about them, in addition to also being already left-handed heavy.\n\nManzardo will have to split time between DH/1B with Naylor. Will Brennan, Estevan Florial and David Fry, who have split most of the time at DH so far this year, may see more time in the outfield with Kwan out in order to open up time for Manzardo at DH against right-handed pitching.\n\nThe Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, native is one of the top prospects in the Guardians' system, lauded for his approach at the plate, making above-average contact and an ability to work walks, while showing average power overall.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_lada@news-herald.com", "name": "Justin Lada", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Beede", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Beede"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fry_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Fry (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Fall_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Fall League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeur_d'Alene,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coeur d'Alene, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coeur d'Alene, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.news-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24054735983174.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541401", "eventUri": "eng-9541401", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 176, "textEnd": 181}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 370, "textEnd": 375}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 456, "textEnd": 461}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 591, "textEnd": 596}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The Guardians figured Civale's trade value had peaked, and they were dubious about their chances in the second half after a sluggish first four months of the season. They had struggled to develop middle-of-the-order bats, especially ones who could muscle a fastball over the outfield fence.\n\nSo, the two teams hooked up for a trade. One league source told The Athletic at the time that Tampa would come to regret the swap. Nine months later, we'll start to find out if that's the case.\n\nThe Guardians are expected to add Manzardo to their active roster on Monday, a club source told The Athletic.\n\nIt will come at a cost: Steven Kwan will head to the 10-day injured list with a left hamstring injury.\n\nKwan has fueled Cleveland's lineup for the first six weeks of the season, a key reason the Guardians sit in first place in the AL Central and boast the third-best run differential in the league. Now, it'll be up to Manzardo to deliver some power and patience from the left side, behind Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez and Josh Naylor in the meat of Stephen Vogt's batting order.\n\nManzardo, 23, has checked every box on the organization's to-do list thus far. He returned from a shoulder injury last summer and showcased his blend of power and plate discipline both at Triple-A Columbus and in the Arizona Fall League. He thrived in spring training, to the point that Guardians hitting coach Chris Valaika said he reminded him of Wade Boggs in the batter's box (and not just because of his mustache).\n\nIn 29 games with Columbus this season, Manzardo has recorded a .303/.375/.642 slash line, with nine home runs, 10 doubles and healthy walk and strikeout rates.\n\nHe certainly seemed like he had nothing left to accomplish in the minors, but the Guardians resisted promoting him sooner, sources said, because of the composition of their big-league roster. They're already short on right-handed bats, so they're hesitant to cut ties with veteran Ram\u00f3n Laureano so early in the season. They're still curious about what Estevan Florial, Will Brennan and Tyler Freeman can contribute, too. With Kwan sidelined, they have more time to sort out their mess in the outfield while also working Manzardo into the daily lineup equation.\n\nThe Rays selected Manzardo in the second round of the 2021 draft out of Washington State. The native of Couer d'Alene, Idaho, was ranked the No. 66 prospect in baseball by The Athletic's Keith Law before the 2024 season. Manzardo and outfielder Chase DeLauter are widely considered the organization's top two prospects. DeLauter, however, is dealing with a fracture in the fifth metatarsal in his left foot, the same foot he had surgery on in January 2023. He will meet with a specialist on Wednesday. DeLauter had started the season at Double-A Akron after a torrid spring performance earned him plenty of attention from the organization's chief decision-makers.\n\nKwan, meanwhile, suffered his hamstring injury on Saturday night while chasing a fly ball in left field. He had no shortage of hamstring flare-ups throughout his college career at Oregon State and in the minors, but he has avoided injuries during his two-plus seasons in the big leagues. He leads the AL with a .353 batting average and ranks fourth with 1.9 fWAR.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

MLB.com's ranking of Cleveland prospects puts Manzardo at No. 2 in the organization behind only outfielder Chase DeLauter.\n\nCBS Sports ranked Manzardo as the No. 45 prospect in all of baseball,

The team has not confirmed the moves.\n\nManzardo, the team's No. 2 prospect and No. 52 overall according to MLB Pipeline, has done everything in his power to get this call. In his last 14 games alone, he's hit eight homers with six doubles and 14 RBIs. His defense at first base has improved and his bat has been consistent since the Triple-A season began.\n\n\"He's been good against left-handed pitching, his approach against lefties has improved,\" Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti said prior to Cleveland's 4-1 victory over the Angels on Sunday. \"He's worked really hard at his defense, both his footwork around the bag and his throwing and he continues to put up and manage really good at-bats.\"\n\nThe problem was, the Guardians didn't have room for young first baseman on the active roster. Josh Naylor handles the everyday duties at first base. Gabriel Arias brings defensive versatility to the table. Estevan Florial is still young and the team needs a longer look at him before deciding if it wants to part ways. Ram\u00f3n Laureano is one of the few right-handed bats the team can turn to off the bench.

He spent the beginning of this season playing for the Columbus Clippers, the Guardians' AAA club, hitting .303 with 10 doubles, 9 home runs and 20 RBI.\n\nA second-round pick by the Tampa Bay Rays in 2021, Manzardo was traded to the Guardians' organization just before the trade deadline last season. At that time, he was injured, but he returned and finished the year with Columbus.\n\nAt WSU, Manzardo was named to the All-America first team by Collegiate Baseball in 2021, the Cougars' first first-team selection since pitcher Aaron Sele in 1990. That year, Manzardo slashed .366/.437/.640, mashing 11 home runs and 60 RBI as the Cougs secured their highest draft pick since 1991.\n\nManzardo, named to the All-Pac-12 Conference team after the 2021 season, broke out in 2022 with Class A Bowling Green and Double-A Montgomery. Combined, he hit .327 with 27 doubles, 22 home runs and 81 RBI across 93 games. At those two stops, he combined for a slash line of .327/.426/.617.\n\nA former Lake City High standout in Coeur d'Alene, Manzardo was coached in high school by his father, Paul. He resigned in December 2022 to care for his wife and Kyle's mother, Windy, who is awaiting a heart transplant due to a rare disease called sarcoidosis.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com",

His loss is a blow to the first-place Guardians. In addition to being a standout fielder in left, the two-time Gold Glove winner had been enjoying a magma-hot start at the plate. Thus far in 2024, Kwan has batted an American League-best .353 with a .407 OBP and a .496 SLG. His 47 hits led the AL coming into Sunday's slate.\n\nAs for Manzardo, he'll bring excellent left-handed power potential to Cleveland. Acquired from the Rays at least year's trade deadline in exchange for Aaron Civale, Manzardo came into this season ranked as the No. 45 overall prospect in MLB by CBS Sports. Here's part of R.J. Anderson's February write-up:\n\n\"All Manzardo has done as a professional is hit and hit some more by combining a disciplined approach with a feel for the barrel. He lacks the top-end exit velocities (and strength) commonly associated with the first-base position. All the Guardians can do is hope that he continues to make up for it by hitting for average (something he notably did not do in Triple-A) and minding the zone. He should get an opportunity to join the Cleveland lineup sometime early in 2024.\"\n\nThis season, the 23-year-old Manzardo, a former second-rounder out of Washington State, has batted .303/.375/.642 for Triple-A Columbus with nine homers and 10 doubles in 29 games.\n\nThe Guardians under rookie manager Stephen Vogt entered Sunday with a record of 22-12 and a two-game lead over the Twins in the AL Central.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dayn_perry@cbssports.com", "name": "Dayn Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Civale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Civale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Vogt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Vogt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Pinball", "label": "dmoz/Games/Coin-Op/Pinball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/05/65ccd2ef-de77-4bf5-becb-84938764ad76/thumbnail/1200x675/3a36d8abc8e9f720ab131ef285784d0a/manzardo-usatsi.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541401", "eventUri": "eng-9541401", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Last year, he won his second straight Gold Glove with the Guardians.\n\nLast year, Kwan spoke about his unconventional approach to the plate that has helped him become one of the best leadoff hitters in baseball.\n\n\"I don't mind hitting from behind in the count,\" Kwan said. \"I have the confidence where, if I'm down 0-2, it's not like, 'I'm screwed.' I know what (the pitcher's) idea is and I can battle from there.\"\n\n\"I'm usually going to put the ball in play so I have to be really selective at what I'm going to swing at.

However, that all changed as the Guardians received some not-so-great news regarding one of their top players.\n\nSteven Kwan will spend some time on the injured list as he nurses a left hamstring strain. The team said the injury is expected to take four weeks to heal.\n\nCleveland's left fielder initially left the game on Saturday evening after making a running catch down the foul line. Kwan received an MRI on the injury the next day which concluded that he needed some time off to let his body heal.\n\nWhat makes this much more painful for the team is that Kwan is off to an incredible start this season. He's currently hitting .353/.407/.496 with a .903 OPS including three home runs and 11 RBI. Not to mention his Gold Glove-caliber defense has been on display numerous times already this season.\n\nNot having Kwan for what could be an extended period of time will be difficult for this team to navigate.\n\nThe Kwan news is tough to swallow, but this is still a reason for fans to be excited about the upcoming series.\n\nCleveland has officially called up their second-ranked prospect Kyle Manzardo who is ready to make his big league debut.

The organization acquired him last summer when it traded starting pitcher Aaron Civale to the Tampa Bay Rays. In 29 games at Triple-A Columbus, Manzardo has hit .303 this season with a 1.017 OPS, nine home runs, 10 doubles and 20 RBIs in 109 at-bats. In 13 spring training games, Manzardo hit .381 with a .934 OPS, two double and two RBIs in 21 at-bats. A Washington State product, Manzardo was a second-round draft pick of the Rays in 2021.\n\nAlthough Manzardo's MLB debut will be highly anticipated, the Guardians certainly did not want to lose Kwan to the hamstring injury he suffered Saturday in a 7-1 win over the Los Angeles Angels. The Guardians leadoff hitter entered Sunday with an American League-leading 47 hits and .353 batting average.\n\nFirst pitch for the Guardians-Tigers game is scheduled for 6:10 p.m. Monday.

Until then, here is some pregame information.\n\nWhere are the Guardians in the American League Central standings?\n\nAfter winning two games in a row against the Angels, the Guardians entered Monday with a record of 22-12 and sitting atop the American League Central standings.\n\nThe Minnesota Twins (19-14) and Kansas City Royals (20-15) were 2.5 games behind the Guardians in the division. The Tigers (18-16) were four games back. The Chicago White Sox (8-26) trailed the Guardians by 14 games.\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game tonight?\n\nThe game will be televised by FS1 and Bally Sports Great Lakes. It will be broadcast on the radio by WTAM (1100-AM), WMMS (100.7-FM) and WARF (1350-AM).\n\nGuardians vs Tigers pitching matchup\n\nGuardians right-handed starting pitcher Triston McKenzie will take the mound opposite Tigers right-handed starting pitcher Jack Flaherty.\n\nMcKenzie is 2-2 this season with a 4.34 ERA in 29 innings. In six starts, he has struck out 24 and walked 18.\n\nFlaherty is 0-1 this season with a 4.00 ERA in 36 innings. In six starts, he has struck out 50 and walked five.\n\nGuardians schedule, next game\n\nThe Guardians are scheduled to host the Tigers again at 6:10 p.m. Tuesday and 1:10 p.m. Wednesday.

The club announced Kwan underwent an MRI to confirm the injury and is expected to miss approximately four weeks before he'll be ready to play for the Guardians again.\n\n\"Same Kwanny,\" Vogt said before the Guardians opened a three-game series with the Detroit Tigers at Progressive Field. \"Just great attitude, like, 'Hey, yeah, I'll be back. I'm going to do this.'\n\n\"That's who he is, so I know he's going to be smart. We have a great medical staff. They're going to make sure he's dialed in and ready to go. You can't replace somebody like that, but hopefully [he's] back soon.\"\n\nKyle Manzardo promoted: Guardians call up No. 2 prospect in organization before series with Tigers\n\nEstevan Florial will lead off and play left field for the American League Central-leading Guardians (22-12) to begin their series against the divisional foe Tigers (18-16). Vogt mentioned Will Brennan, Gabriel Arias and David Fry as other potential options for the Guardians during Kwan's absence.\n\n\"That's the beauty of this team,\" Vogt said. \"We've got so much versatility. We can match up well with the pitcher.\"\n\nKwan had been on fire. He entered Sunday with an AL-leading 47 hits and .353 batting average. He scored 28 runs and compiled six doubles, two triples and three home runs with a .903 OPS.\n\n\"Obviously, super unfortunate news for Steven,\" Vogt said. \"We're going to miss Kwanny a lot. It sounds like four weeks, so kind of not a horrific hamstring, but anytime it's hamstring, it's not good. Anytime without Kwanny at the top of our order is not good, but sounds like it shouldn't hinder him too long. Just got to make sure that he's back to a hundred percent before we get him back out there.\"\n\nCleveland Guardians call up prospect: What to know about Kyle Manzardo\n\nKwan, 26, has been instrumental to the Guardians' success this season. While discussing the setback, Vogt invoked the team's response to losing ace Shane Bieber last month to season-ending Tommy John surgery.\n\n\"It comes down to that group in the room there rallying around each other, rallying around Kwanny,\" Vogt said. \"It's not one person needs to come in and replace him.

Both fouls came off the bat in excess of 100 mph.\n\n\"The very next pitch, I don't know if the guy went back-to-back breaking ball, but (Manzardo) hammered one to left-center for a double, and I just went, 'Yeah, that guy's a dude.'\"\n\nThe Guardians are set to promote that dude for his first taste of life in the major leagues on Monday as the club opens a series tonight against division rival Detroit at Progressive Field.\n\nManzardo has earned the big league at-bats that are coming his way. He hit four home runs in his last seven games at Triple-A Columbus and for the season is batting .303 with a 1.017 OPS and nine home runs over 128 plate appearances. He has 22 strikeouts, but has walked 15 times and driven in 20 runs.\n\n\"I'm just going to keep worrying about trying to hit the ball hard,\" Manzardo said during an exclusive interview with cleveland.com in October. \"Obviously the more you can hit the ball hard, the more runs the team's going to score. So, I'm just helping out wherever I can whenever it's that time.\"\n\nRanked the No. 52 overall prospect by MLB Pipeline and the No. 2 prospect at first base, Manzardo is expected to see the bulk of his at-bats at designated hitter while spelling Josh Naylor at first on occasion.\n\nThe Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, native would often show up to college practices in a flannel and beanie looking like he had just come off a fishing trip, Green said. But once the 6-foot-1, 205-pound son of a high school baseball coach got to work between the lines, winning was all that mattered.\n\n\"His identity was entirely about just being a great competitive baseball player and that's just what he was about,\" Green said, \"He wanted to be viewed as tough and there was a lot of maturity. I mean, he's one of those slam dunk guys who's going to play in the big leagues just on his personality, really.\"\n\nGreen likened Manzardo's approach to that of an electrician, or a plumber or contractor.\n\n\"He punches in every day,\" Green said. \"He loves baseball, he believes in routines, he believes in his drills, he understands the maintenance. He really values the structure of having a process and a routine. His tee work, his toss work, his flip work, and that's him.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He spent the beginning of this season playing for the Columbus Clippers, the Guardians' AAA club, hitting .303 with 10 doubles, 9 home runs and 20 RBI.\n\nA second-round pick by the Tampa Bay Rays in 2021, Manzardo was traded to the Guardians' organization just before the trade deadline last season. At that time, he was injured, but he returned and finished the year with Columbus.\n\nAt WSU, Manzardo was named to the All-America first team by Collegiate Baseball in 2021, the Cougars' first first-team selection since pitcher Aaron Sele in 1990. That year, Manzardo slashed .366/.437/.640, mashing 11 home runs and 60 RBI as the Cougs secured their highest draft pick since 1991.\n\nManzardo, named to the All-Pac-12 Conference team after the 2021 season, broke out in 2022 with Class A Bowling Green and Double-A Montgomery. Combined, he hit .327 with 27 doubles, 22 home runs and 81 RBI across 93 games. At those two stops, he combined for a slash line of .327/.426/.617.\n\nA former Lake City High standout in Coeur d'Alene, Manzardo was coached in high school by his father, Paul. He resigned in December 2022 to care for his wife and Kyle's mother, Windy, who is awaiting a heart transplant due to a rare disease called sarcoidosis.\n\nFootballUW, Fisch add two Arizona transfers\n\nThe Washington Huskies picked up their sixth transfer portal arrival of the spring on Sunday as former Arizona Wildcats running back Jordan Washington announced on social media he will join coach Jedd Fisch at UW for the 2024 season.\n\nA four-star prospect after a prolific career at Jordan High School in Southern California, Washington is the 16th player with Arizona ties to announce a transfer to UW.\n\n\"I think we have some commits that we just can't comment on, just because of the fact they haven't signed or enrolled,\" Fisch said Friday after UW's spring game. \"But we're pretty close to having our roster full.\"\n\nWashington, listed at 5-foot-11, 180 pounds, spent three productive seasons prepping at Jordan, where he rushed for more than 4,000 yards and 47 touchdowns.\n\nHe was also a track star during his high school career. Washington finished second in the 100-meter dash during the 2023 CIF State Championships, running the event in 10.30 seconds as a junior.\n\nWashington's football and track skills made him a four-star high school recruit. He was the No. 24 running back in the country and ranked 29th among prep prospects in California, according to the 247Sports composite ratings.\n\nWashington wasn't the only former Wildcat to join the Huskies on Sunday. Sophomore wide receiver Kevin Green Jr. also announced on his social media he will transfer to UW.\n\nGreen, listed at 5-11, 170 pounds, spent two seasons at Arizona. He played in 14 games, making eight catches for 97 yards. Green operated as the Wildcats' backup slot receiver behind Jacob Cowing, a 2024 fourth-round draft pick by the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nBefore arriving at Arizona, Green was considered a three-star prospect by the 247Sports composite rankings after prepping at Bishop Alemany High School in Southern California.\n\nBasketballTransfer Battle commits to Gonzaga\n\nKhalif Battle amassed 1,343 points the last five seasons at Butler, Temple and Arkansas, averaging an astounding 29.6 points through the final seven games of the 2023-24 season with the Razorbacks.\n\nBattle's next points will come in a Gonzaga uniform after the coveted transfer guard announced a commitment to the Bulldogs early Sunday evening, a few days after wrapping up an official visit to Spokane.\n\nLast week, Battle told On3.com he'd narrowed his list down to three schools -- Gonzaga, Kansas State and Villanova -- and reports suggested the guard spent the last few days deciding between the Bulldogs and Big 12 Wildcats.\n\nAt approximately 5 p.m. on Sunday, Battle posted a graphic to his Instagram account containing a photoshopped image of the guard wearing a white No. 0 Gonzaga jersey and the words \"Zag Up.\"\n\nMoments after Battle's commitment, Gonzaga acknowledged the news by posting its customary \"Zags got dudes\" video to X -- a clip used whenever the program lands a high school recruit or transfer.\n\nBattle's addition solidifies Gonzaga as a preseason top-10 team and heightens expectations that the Bulldogs could return to the Final Four for the first time since 2021 and potentially vie for the program's first-ever national championship.\n\nHuskies land Oakland's Conway: The Washington men's basketball team and new head coach Danny Sprinkle added a player from the transfer portal as former Oakland forward Chris Conway announced his commitment to the Huskies on social media.\n\nConway, a 6-foot-9 senior with one year of eligibility remaining, averaged 10 points and 4.3 rebounds per game on 54.2% shooting for the Golden Grizzlies, who as a 14-seed stunned No. 3 Kentucky 80-76 in the opening round of the NCAA tournament this past season.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com",

The matchup is available on multiple streaming services for free.\n\nToday's game will broadcast live on Fox Sports 1 and Bally Sports Great Lakes with a first pitch at 6:10 p.m. Eastern. Fans who have parted ways with their local cable provider can catch one of the hottest teams in baseball for free by utilizing streaming alternatives like Fubo or DirecTV Stream, which both offer free trials. You may cancel before the end of the free trial to avoid being charged. Sling TV is also offering promotional discounts for new customers.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the Guardians tout the second-best record in the American League, behind only the Baltimore Orioles (23-11) and the third-best record in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Guardians (22-12) are coming off another series victory, taking two of three from the Los Angeles Angels. Five-time All-Star Jose Ramirez and Josh Naylor both belted home runs in the rubber match to help Cleveland stay 2 and 1/2 games ahead of the Kansas City Royals and red-hot Minnesota Twins in the American League Central.\n\nRamirez had not recorded a hit in six consecutive games (0 of 19) before breaking out of the slump.\n\nStarting pitcher Carlos Carrasco (2-2) allowed one run and six hits in six innings of work in a solid outing. He had allowed 13 runs in nine innings in his previous two starts.\n\nCleveland recently suffered a significant setback losing outfielder Steven Kwan (hamstring strain) to the 10-day injured list. Kwan entered the weekend leading the American League in batting average with .356.\n\nWhen one door closes, another opens as the Guardians have made official the highly anticipated call-up of prospect Kyle Manzardo. He was acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays at the trade deadline for pitcher Aaron Civale.\n\nManzardo has hit eight home runs and 14 RBI'S in his past 14 games with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers.\n\nHere's more information on how you can watch today's game on TV and through various streaming services:\n\nStarting pitching and starting times: RHP Triston McKenzie (2-2, 4.34) vs. RHP Jack Flaherty (0-1, 4.00) Monday at 6:10 p.m.; LHP Logan Allen (3-2, 5.11) vs. RHP Kenta Maeda (1-1, 5.02) Tuesday at 6:10 p.m. and RHP Tanner Bibee (2-1, 4.46) vs. RHP Reese Olson (0-4, 2.70) Wednesday at 1:10 p.m.\n\nSeries: The Guards went 4-9 against Detroit last year. The Tigers lead, 1153-1148, overall.\n\nTigers update (18-16): They arrive in Cleveland after getting swept in a three-game series by the Yankees. They are 5-6 in their last 11 games. Riley Greene leads the team with a .269 batting average, eight homers and 32 RBI. Kerry Carpenter hit three homers with eight RBI against the Guards last year.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

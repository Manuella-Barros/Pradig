You can view that clip for yourself, below.\n\nOne of the viewers who called in asked Hoda how she feels about the world (or, at least, a significant portion of the Today audience) shipping her with Kevin Costner.\n\nSparks, these fans observed, seemed to fly between Hoda and Costner during their interview in June. And, well, a lot of fans think that the two could really connect on a less professional level.\n\nNews of fans feeling this way came as a clear shock to Hoda.\n\n\"Wait what?,\" she asked alongside some nervous laughter. \"I have never ever heard that, not one time.\"\n\nAndy Cohen was sure to explain for the chronologically challenged that shipping means that viewers want Hoda and Costner together. The term ship in this context stems from relationship. This specific phrasing first emerged in the X-Files fandom in the 1990s, eventually breaking containment from fanfiction circles as people apply it to real-life (potential) couples.\n\nObviously, Andy (and fans) were putting Hoda on the spot with regards to this possible Kevin Costner pairing. But she handled it well.\n\n\"Well, if the viewers want it,\" Hoda quipped, looking into the camera.\n\nSavannah Guthrie chimed in: \"Give the people what they want!\" That's all very cute ... and was not the end of it.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 10, Today With Hoda and Jenna continued the conversation, with Jenna Bush Hager bringing up the WWHL moment.\n\n\"I actually did know because people were coming up to me on the street, and people were like, 'You should set up Hoda and Kevin Costner,'\" Jenna revealed.\n\nShe then joked: \"I didn't know they were flirting behind my back.\"\n\nProducers for the show ran an edit of Hoda Kotb and Kevin Costner from their still-fairly-recent interview.\n\nAs you can see in the video below, the video is suggestive -- set to slow, romantic music, making it seem that Hoda and Costner were flirting.\n\n\"Y'all are ridiculous,\" Hoda declared accurately with a laugh. \"The slow-mo' and the music, really?\"\n\nAs anyone who has found out that people \"ship\" them with a close friend or colleague can attest, this can be an awkward situation. Sometimes, like Hoda, all that you can do is giggle.\n\nWe don't think that Hoda intends to become another of Kevin Costner's famous ex-wives. It's just funny to talk about -- so long as no one takes the joke too far.\n\nThere is some peril when it comes to fans obsessing over celebrities (and wanting them to kiss).

To mark the occasion, Hoda took a seat in the interviewee chair this time and caught up with TODAY.com about the milestone -- and answered some of the questions she always asks her guests.\n\nHoda says she values the \"freedom\" the longer interviews she does for her podcast provide, compared to the shorter ones she does for TODAY, and that they can \"unfold as they wish.\"\n\n\"We're limited with four minutes of airtime, which is great for a TODAY show interview -- four or five minutes -- but on the podcast, we get to really know somebody,\" she explains. \"Not just know what they are about, but know their heart, know their soul.\"\n\n\"Imagine that privilege,\" she adds, noting the gift of asking someone about their life story and \"what makes them tick.\"\n\n\"I feel like it's packed with life lessons, because I only get one life: mine,\" Hoda says, before naming a few of her guests she's learned these lessons from, like Viola Davis and Mel Robbins.\n\n\"It nourishes your life,\" she says.\n\nThe aforementioned country music phenom, Wilson, is Hoda's 50th guest on her podcast. The singer, who's also known for her role on \"Yellowstone,\" is currently on her \"Country's Cool Again Tour,\" and she recently rocked the TODAY plaza and took home her first Grammy Award earlier this year.\n\nHoda has two words to describe Wilson: \"unbelievable\" and \"incredible.\"\n\n\"She's one of these people who a lot of us felt like just popped up on the scene,\" Hoda says. \"I'm such a fan (of) people who had to kind of claw and scrape their way to their position where they are, and almost everyone I've interviewed is that.\"\n\nHoda also worked her way up to where she is now and advocated for herself to get her job as a co-host on the fourth hour, saying her prior breast cancer diagnosis provided her the courage to do so.\n\nHoda says she also admires Wilson for staying true to herself, despite her current success.\n\n\"She's a delight. She is honest. She is the next generation of fantastic and unbelievable country music stars,\" she explains. \"She's someone who you want to be friends with. I loved everything about her.\"\n\nFifty has been a significant number for Hoda, who has been open about how her life's \"blessings\" began later in life.\n\n\"My 50s were my best,\" Hoda says, \"and I imagine, because my 50s were my best, that my 60s will be even better than that.\"\n\nShe explains she always \"dreamt\" about what her life would look like but that you \"never really know.\"\n\n\"Blessings come when they come. You don't get the choice,\" Hoda says.\n\n\"In my 50s, I got my children, I got the job I dreamt of, I found out who I was myself,\" she adds. \"Finally, I feel like I'm 100% me.\"\n\nHoda says she's \"so excited and fired up\" to turn 60 in August.\n\n\"I feel like I'm a better version, or more myself, each year I grow older,\" she says. \"I think a lot of times we spend our time pretending -- being someone we're not. ...

But just before the first advertisement played, the camera panned back to hosts Hoda and Savannah, who were waving their scripts at the camera after realising the error.\n\nBy this point, their microphones had already been turned down as the show's theme music began to play, prompting Savannah to burst out laughing as she held her face in her hands.\n\nEventually, the sound returned and Hoda corrected her blunder.\n\n\"Can you hear us? Wynonna Judd, we knew that,\" she said.\n\n\"Not Winona Ryder. Someone's remembering the 90s,\" Savannah chimed in, getting a laugh from her co-host. Watch the moment below.\n\nToday is broadcast live over three hours, so mistakes are bound to happen every once in a while - even by experienced hosts like Hoda!\n\nThe popular TV personality has been on our screens for over two decades, having first joined NBC News as a correspondent for Dateline in 1998.\n\nHoda became the first host of Today's Fourth Hour in 2007 and was joined by Kathie Lee Gifford the following year. Kathy was later succeeded by Jenna Bush Hager in 2019, who still fronts the show alongside Hoda.\n\nThen in 2018, Hoda was announced as the new co-anchor of Today alongside Savannah. She took over from Matt Lauer, whose 20-year stint came to an end after allegations of sexual harassment and assault were brought to light.\n\nHoda and Savannah have become firm friends since hosting the show together. Sharing her appreciation for Hoda, Savannah previously told HELLO!: \"We feel grateful every single day, I know we feel grateful for this partnership and getting to come and do a job that is literally fun and to get to do it with a good friend who you trust so much and to just hold hands and get to do this together every morning - I never get over that.

I used to wear glasses, I took my glasses off. I didn't know up was down, down was up,\" she continued.\n\nThere was one moment, however, Hoda still remembers to this day.\n\n\"I was in a class sitting there listening to some teacher talk, and they handed out a test,\" she explained. \"I looked at the test, and I got up, and I put on my backpack. I'm like, 'I'm probably going to flunk out of school.' I took my backpack, and the teacher was going, 'Hey! You're going to fail my class if you walk out that door.'\"\n\nHoda said she couldn't continue sitting there and walked out the door. She recalled that her best friend, Peggy, was sitting behind her at the time, and Peggy also walked out of the classroom.\n\n\"I didn't say a word. She walked with me to the duck pond,\" Hoda added.\n\n\"That makes me want to cry,\" Wilson chimed in.\n\nHoda explained Peggy sat next to her and \"didn't say a word.\"\n\n\"That's what it's about,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"That feeling, it's like a warm hand on your heart,\" Hoda said.\n\n\"I go, 'Are you crazy?'\" she remembered asking Peggy. \"And she goes, 'No, I'm crazy about you. Let's just sit here. Let's talk it out if you want.'\"\n\nHoda then emphasized the importance of having \"those people\" and understanding that feeling.\n\n\"You don't need to talk it all out,\" she explained. \"You just need to know that somebody's there.\"\n\nIn 2021, Hoda shared with Minnie Driver on the actor's podcast, \"Minnie Questions,\" how she found out that her dad had passed away suddenly and what that first night without him was like.\n\nIn their wide-ranging conversation, the two also touched on how her father's death became a driving force in her career, how she endured breast cancer and a divorce simultaneously and the moment early in her relationship with her ex Joel Schiffman that she raised the question of adopting a child with him.\n\nShe was at a sorority formal when her brother, Adel, who was also attending Virginia Tech at the time, came to find her.\n\n\"And my brother runs in, and I was like, 'Oh, my God, my brother always said he was gonna crash Tri Delt formals, like he and his buddy did it. And he said, 'Come outside.' And I said, 'What?' He goes, 'Come outside, I need to talk to you,' and I go, 'No.' I said, 'You need to tell me,' and he said, 'Dad had a heart attack, and he died.'\n\n\"It was like you couldn't even compute what was going on.\"\n\nHoda stayed at her brother's apartment that night.\n\n\"And I played James Taylor on the turntable over and over and over and over until we went home that morning,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she believes that terrible loss also pushed her to reach the top in her career.\n\n\"And it's funny, it was the worst thing in the world, but I often look around where I am now and wonder,\" she said. \"You know you always want an 'attagirl' from your dad, you always want a 'you did it.' Throughout my career I think there were probably a few spots where he probably would've said, 'Well, good for you, you did it,' and then I would've been done.\n\n\"But instead when you don't have that 'attagirl,' you're like, I guess there's more of this mountain to climb, let's see, let's see, let's see. And you may keep pushing yourself for something that isn't coming, but at the end of the day it landed me in a beautiful place. Now I have a beautiful family, and all those great things happened as a result of it. So I think that event was really life-changing. It helped me in some ways, and it left me with unfinished business in others.\"\n\nHoda also recalled another time of heartbreak that she turned into a positive after getting to the other side of it. In 2007, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and her marriage ended.\n\n\"In this weird span of a week I found out that I needed a mastectomy, and at the same time I found out that the guy who I was married to was being unfaithful,\" she told Driver. \"And I literally was like, 'What is happening? What happened?' I didn't understand.\"\n\nWhile recovering from surgery, the phrase \"you can't scare me\" became a mantra for her. With that in mind, she had learned that TODAY was creating a fourth hour of the show, and she decided to go for the job despite usually being skittish about being a self-promoter when it comes to her career.\n\nShe approached the company's president at the time and lobbied for the co-host spot.\n\n\"And I end up getting that damn job, and I thought to myself, 'Oh, my God, if I hadn't gotten sick, I wouldn't have the guts, I wouldn't have had the courage, I wouldn't have had the mojo, I wouldn't have gone up, I would've never asked, I would've waited like I usually do, but instead it was urgent,\" she said. \"All of a sudden life was urgent.\"\n\nThat tumultuous period years ago is a far cry from the joy of her life now as the mother of daughters Haley and Hope, whom she adopted with Joel.\n\n\"I always dreamt of being a mom,\" she said. \"I thought it was in my DNA. I had some bumps in the road, a divorce and an illness, and then you realize, 'Well, wait, I think the window went past me,' and you almost are shocked, like, 'Wait, what happened, how did I miss that window?'\"\n\nHoda had even researched how to become a schoolteacher as a post-TODAY career in order to be close to kids. However, seeing a video of a young child covered in soot from the rubble of a bombing in Syria planted the seed of adoption.\n\n\"I was struggling with it, and I looked at that kid and I said, 'Oh, my God, what I wouldn't do to be the mother to that child,' and that was, like, the final sign. There were so many signs before, but I think that was the sign. And I said, 'If God tells you something, pay attention.'\"\n\nShe had only been dating Joel for six months at the time when she decided to ask him if he would want to adopt a child with her.\n\nJoel answered without hesitation.\n\n\"Maybe on second No. 5, he said, 'I don't need a week, I don't need any time to think about it, the answer's yes,'\" Hoda said. \"I literally fell on his chest and sobbed.\"\n\nHoda can still remember looking at the clock and seeing that it was 11:53 when she received a message from a woman at the adoption agency about Haley.\n\n\"I called her, and she said two words: 'She's here,'\" Hoda said. \"I don't know what a live birth feels like, but that was pretty cool what I just got there. It was pretty amazing.\n\n\"It was one of those time stands still, everything's frozen. It's like your life changes in a blink, and there's a before and after.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Driver", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnie Driver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lainey_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lainey Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(American_TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Today (American TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adoption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/hoda-making-space-ashley-graham-mc-2x1-240605-02-482085.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722748", "eventUri": "eng-9722748", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

I am a married, honest woman, finally!\"\n\nMarried life became more challenging when Burza - a self confessed New Orleans boy -- lost his apartment to Hurricane Katrina and moved to New York to be with Hoda whose career was going from strength to strength.\n\nShe confessed to the outlet that it was \"hard,\" for Burza to acclimatize to the city, but still insisted married life was \"great.\"\n\nWhen Burza reflected on the move during an interview with RadarOnline, 10 years after they split he recognized he wasn't happy in the Big Apple: \"I was not used to the big city I guess. New York can be overwhelming. I've lived in New Orleans for 30 years now. This is my home.\"\n\nIn February, 2007, Hoda filed for divorce from Burza. This was the same month she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nHe explained to RadarOnline. \"We had some differences. My father was ill. She was ill. It was a difficult time. Those were personal reasons for both of us.\n\n\"The divorce happened under difficult conditions. Those were personal reasons for both of us. In hindsight, there was a level of immaturity on my part, mistakes I made. It was unfortunate we were married for a short time. It's a shame it transpired that way.\"\n\nBurza added: \"I will always cherish our memories. She is the epitome of class. I think the world of her. We had great memories together.\"\n\nHoda later found love with Joel Schiffman, who she began dating in 2013. They went on to adopt their daughters, Haley, seven, and Hope, four, together and got engaged in 2019.\n\nBut at the start of 2022, Hoda revealed during an episode of Today, that they had made the decision to split.\n\nAt the time, she told her co-host Jenna Bush Hager: \"Joel and I have had a lot of prayerful and really meaningful conversations over the holidays, and we decided that we're better as friends and parents than we are as an engaged couple.\"\n\nShe added: \"So we decided that we are going to start this new year and begin it kind of on our new path as loving parents to our adorable, delightful children, and as friends.\"", "source": {"uri": "hellomagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HELLO!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Orleans", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Online", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radar Online"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heart_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Heart Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valentine's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_Cana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punta Cana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punta Cana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurricane Katrina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bush_Hager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Bush Hager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e9754e745bc5-new-project-15.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722748", "eventUri": "eng-9722748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2007-02-", "textStart": 1484, "textEnd": 1498}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

And what's the meaning behind the names of the TODAY show anchors? From Al to Willie, we took a deep dive to find out more about the origins and popularity of their names.\n\nSavannah Guthrie, co-anchor of TODAY\n\nSavannah Guthrie may have a name synonymous with the famous city in Georgia, but the TODAY anchor is Australia-born. The name Savannah, according to Nameberry, means \"flat, tropical grassland.\"\n\nSavannah Guthrie was born in 1971 and that year, \"Savannah\" didn't even crack the top 1000 ranked baby girl names: That wouldn't happen until 1983, when it ranked 466, according to the Social Security Administration. However, it's grown tremendously in popularity since then -- peaking at number 30 in 2006 and 2007. Most recently, it ranked number 92 in 2023.\n\nHoda Kotb, co-anchor of TODAY and co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna\n\nNo doubt that Hoda Kotb is the most famous woman in America to have the name. According to MomJunction.com, \"Hoda is a unique Arabic and Persian name primarily given to girls, although it may also be used as a masculine name. As a feminine name, it is an alternate spelling or the Persian form of the name Huda, which means 'right guidance ' in Arabic. It is a popular name in Islamic countries and several Muslim families worldwide.\"\n\nHoda remains a very unique name in the States, however. It has never ranked in the top 1,000 names for babies born in the United States, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe name \"Hoda\" did inspire a cute nickname for the TODAY anchor while she was in college at Virginia Tech. Her college friends and sorority sisters calle her \"Hodie.\"\n\nAl Roker, weather anchor for TODAY, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nAlbert Roker -- known as \"Al\" to TODAY viewers and weather watchers everywhere -- seems to have a personality that perfectly matches the meaning of his given name.\n\nAlbert, according to TheBump.com, means, \"Noble, bright and famous.\" Well, that sure fits Al!\n\nThe name Albert peaked in popularity in 1910 when it ranked number 14 among baby boy names. Since then, the popularity of the name has fluctuated, dipping as far as number 612 in 2022, according to the Social Security Administration. When Al was born in 1954, the name was ranked number 73.\n\nCraig Melvin, news anchor for TODAY, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nCraig Melvin sure is popular with viewers, but it turns out his name isn't popping in the American baby name ranks in recent years.\n\nThe name \"Craig,\" according to Nameberry, is of Scottish origin and means \"from the rocks.\" It should be noted that Craig is still a popular name in its native Scotland. Here in the United States, the name last cracked the top 1,000 baby boy names in 2017 when it ranked 984, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nThe name Craig peaked in popularity in 1969 and 1970 when it ranked number 39 among baby boy names. When our Craig was born in 1979, then name came in at number 77.\n\nCarson Daly, feature anchor for TODAY\n\nHis name means \"son of the marsh dwellers,\" according to Nameberry, but TODAY's Carson Daly is actually the son of parents who dwelled in Southern California.\n\nCarson's longevity in popularity throughout his career is also reflected in the popularity of his name. \"Carson\" enjoyed a spot in the top 100 from 2006 -- 2021 and peaked at number 70 in 2018. The name has also been in the top 1,000 baby boy names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration.\n\nCarson can also be used as a baby girl name, though use of the name for a baby girl is far less common: It's only ranked in the top 1000 girl names 13 times between the years 1992 and 2004.\n\nJenna Bush Hager, co-host of TODAY with Hoda & Jenna\n\nThe name \"Jenna\" has a few meanings: According to TheBump.com, \"Jenna\" means \"white shadow, fair one, or small bird.\" The website speculates the name first came into popularity in the 1970s as a result of the show \"Dallas\" which featured a character named Jenna Wade. The show ran from 1978 to 1991 and during this time, jumped in popularity from 431 to 80, peaking in the year 1985 at number 50.\n\nIt was in 1981 that Jenna Bush Hager was born; fittingly, in Dallas, Texas. That year, the name ranked 196 among baby girl names, according to the Social Security Administration. However, Jenna Bush Hager wasn't named after a character on a television show: According to People, she was named after her maternal grandmother, Jenna Hawkins Welch.\n\nSheinelle Jones, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nIf Sheinelle seems like an unusual name it's because it is! Sheinelle Jones was named for both her parents, TODAY reported in 2018.\n\n\"Side note -- my mom's name is 'Sheila,' my father is 'Darnell -- put it together and it equals 'Sheinelle,'\" she wrote in an Instagram post that year.\n\nWhen the NBC News correspondent came to TODAY in 2016, she shared the sweet story about how her parents fell in love and later named their daughter after them.\n\n\"Once upon a time, there's a really nice lady, her name is Sheila,\" she said. \"And then she met this handsome man in college, his name was Darnell. Years later they had a baby, it's me. And they came up with my name -- it's a merging of their two names.\"\n\nDylan Dreyer, co-host of 3rd hour of TODAY\n\nDylan is a popular unisex baby name -- perfect for a boy or a girl. But while viewer favorite Dylan Dreyer is one of the most famous \"Dylans\" around, the name itself is actually more popular as a baby boy name than a baby girl.\n\nIn 2023 the name Dylan ranked number 34 on the Social Security Administration's list of top baby names. As a baby girl name, Dylan ranked 648.\n\nThe meaning of the name Dylan is \"great tide\" or \"great flow\" according to TheBump.com. \"Inspired by the Welsh sea god Dylan, lending the meaning \"son of the sea,\" your little one can ebb and flow as they move through life. Sailing through the tranquil times, they will quickly learn to move swiftly,\" TheBump.com said.\n\nPeter Alexander, co-anchor, Saturday TODAY\n\nPeter is a classic boy name that has stood the test of time. It has been in the top 1,000 most popular baby boy names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration. The name Peter peaked in popularity at number 35 in 1955. In 2023, the name ranked 210.\n\nThe name Peter has Greek origins and, according to Nameberry, means \"rock\" and \"stone.\" Famous people named Peter include Saint Peter, Peter the Great, and of course TODAY's very own Peter Alexander.\n\nLaura Jarrett, co-anchor, Saturday TODAY\n\nLike Peter, Laura is another name that has ranked in the top 1,000 names since 1900, according to the Social Security Administration. But even with all that longevity, \"Laura\" only cracked the top 10 list of baby girl names once -- it came in at number 10 in 1969.\n\nIt's been on a steady decline since, and in 2023 came in at 365.\n\nThe name Laura, according to Nameberry, is English with Latin roots. It means \"from Laurentum or bay laurel.\"\n\nWillie Geist, host of Sunday TODAY with Willie Geist\n\nOf all the TODAY anchors, William \"Willie\" Geist holds the title of anchor with the most popular name. According to the Social Security Administration, in 2023, it ranked number 10. It has been in the top 10 names nearly 100 times since the year 1900, peaking at number two in the early part of last century.\n\nIn 1979, when Willie Geist was born, the name was ranked at number 13.

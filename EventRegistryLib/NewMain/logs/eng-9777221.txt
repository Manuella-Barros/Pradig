But given advances in civil nuclear technology, we need to stay abreast of breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field,\" said Dr Balakrishnan during the signing.\n\n\"The Agreement facilitates access to information, technological expertise, and allows us to deepen our engagements with civil nuclear experts in the US,\" he added.\n\nThe US has 24 such agreements in force that govern peaceful nuclear cooperation with countries or entities. They are allowed to receive \"significant transfers of nuclear material or equipment\" from the US.\n\nUS firms are generally not authorised to export equipment and materials without a bilateral agreement in force, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in the United States.\n\nIn a fact sheet issued to the media on July 31, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said that any decision to deploy nuclear energy in Singapore will require \"detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in our local context\".\n\nBoth ministries said Singapore will be joining the US Department of State's Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (First) programme, which supports partners to better understand small modular reactors or other newer advanced nuclear energy technologies.\n\nSmall modular reactors are thought to be more suitable for land-scarce, population-dense Singapore as these reactors have a lower power capacity, enhanced safety standards and require much smaller buffer zones compared to conventional reactors. Such reactors have a generation capacity about one-third of traditional reactors.\n\nUnder the First programme, Singapore will gain access to a network of US entities involved in nuclear energy, including the US National Laboratories and countries developing newer nuclear energy technologies, to facilitate its capability building process.\n\nThis will support Singapore's efforts to understand and evaluate advanced nuclear energy technologies, should viable options emerge.\n\n\"This agreement builds on the long-standing civil nuclear collaboration between United States and Singapore and outlines a comprehensive framework to deepen peaceful nuclear cooperation based on a mutual commitment to nuclear non-proliferation,\" said both governments in a joint statement on the signing of the US-Singapore 123 Agreement.\n\nNuclear non-proliferation is the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\n\nThe agreement is expected to come into force by end-2024, after it has been reviewed by the US Congress.\n\nOnce in force, the agreement will enable deeper nuclear cooperation, consistent with the highest international standards of safety, security, and non-proliferation, the statement added.\n\n\"(This will) build on our strong bilateral partnership,\" said both governments.\n\nThere has been a global resurgence of interest in nuclear energy, as countries recognise its potential in helping to get the world to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAt the United Nations climate change conference COP28 in 2023, more than 20 countries - including the US, Japan and South Korea, launched a declaration to triple nuclear energy capacity globally by 2050.\n\nSingapore has indicated that it is considering all options - including nuclear energy - as a potential clean energy source in its push to net zero by 2050, as nuclear power provides a stable source of energy in a cost-effective way.\n\nRenewable sources such as solar and wind can provide zero-emissions energy, but their supply is less stable due to intermittencies in sunshine or wind speeds.\n\nIn South-East Asia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand all have an interest in nuclear power, some of which are looking to build a nuclear power plant in the next decade or so. Indonesia, Philippines, and Vietnam have also signed the 123 Agreements with the US.\n\nThe Nuclear Energy Institute said on its website that the purpose of these agreements is to prevent diversion of commercial nuclear materials and technology from their intended peaceful use.\n\nAmong other rules, countries will be required to adhere to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards on the use and security of nuclear material, and restrict the re-processing and retransfer of the material and equipment.\n\nBy signing the agreement, Singapore will have access to detailed information that the US has placed under export control, and is a prerequisite for Singapore to collaborate with other countries that use nuclear energy technologies and designs containing intellectual property of US origin, said MSE and MTI.\n\nSingapore's agreement with the US builds on the Republic's existing efforts in international collaboration to develop its domestic capability in nuclear safety. For example, existing collaborations have been in place with France, which has deep expertise in nuclear safety.\n\n\"Singapore is open to considering collaborations with countries that can support our capability building in nuclear science and safety,\" said MSE and MTI.\n\nSingapore has also been a member state of the IAEA since 1967, where it leverages their expertise for its capability building.\n\nSingapore is already taking nuclear safety research to the next level, with a new multi-million dollar building for the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Institute, ST previously reported.\n\nThe research building, which is at the National University of Singapore (NUS), has a target of having 100 nuclear safety experts in the longer term. - The Straits Times/ANN", "source":

Deb Fischer, R-Neb. a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.\n\n\"[Some people] dream of the day when China, Russia and North Korea decide they want world peace. The day our enemies voluntarily dismantle their nuclear programs because America has done the same,\" said Fischer at a panel put on by the Heritage Foundation. \"We need to be clear on this: that is a fantasy. A utopian dream world.\"\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department is currently undergoing a modernization of its nuclear capabilities with the Sentinel program.\n\n\"Our nuclear deterrent is nearing a crossroads. To date, we have preserved this deterrent by extending the lifespan of legacy nuclear forces and infrastructure -- in many cases for decades beyond what was originally intended. But these systems will not remain viable indefinitely,\" Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva said in a report released by the Department of Defense. \"In fact, we are now at a point where we must concurrently modernize the entire nuclear triad and the infrastructure that enables its effectiveness.\"\n\nThe 2022 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the upgrade of the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a key priority for sustaining effective nuclear deterrence.\n\nPlanned over the next twenty years, modernization encompasses efforts to update each component of the nuclear triad, according to the Defense Department.\n\n\"This new ICBM system is the next evolution of missile and ground infrastructure technology, featuring significant improvements to range, accuracy, maintainability, and communications,\" according to Northrop Grumman, the Sentinel ICBMs manufacturer. \"The Sentinel system replaces the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, which has been in service for over 50 years.\"\n\nIncreasingly, the U.S. and allies are anxious about threats from Russia and North Korea. Russia has consistently threatened the United States and Europe with nuclear attacks. North Korea has also been testing and boasting its nuclear arsenal.\n\nMany strategic arms reductions treaties have been signed and abandoned over the decades, most recently the New START Treaty between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\"Russia has essentially cheated on every arms control treaty,\" said Matthew Kroenig, professor of Government and Foreign Service at Georgetown University. \"It is suspending compliance with, at least, parts of the New START Treaty.\"\n\nThe New START Treaty was signed by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010 and required the deconstruction of many warheads and deployment systems. Russia reports a buildup of nuclear arms from 2012 to 2016, according to archives from the State Department.\n\nArsenals were required to be limited to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers, 1,550 warheads on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs and warheads for deployed heavy bombers; and 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers.\n\nJust before the central limits took effect in 2018, Russia reported a sharp decline in their arsenal.\n\nIn February of 2023 Russia formally suspended the New START Treaty. \"There's no clause in New START for suspension,\" said Robert Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \"One could make the argument that they're already in breach of New START.\"\n\n\"The threat environment has changed a lot in recent years,\" Kroenig says. \"In 2014 Russia invades Ukraine, 2022 the full scale invasion, Russia making nuclear threats, so the nuclear threat environment has gotten worse.\"\n\nKroenig mentions the Russian \"escalate-to-de escalate,\" which he says the Russians use to threaten \"limited nuclear use\" and to deter the U.S. and NATO.\n\nAccording to Kroenig, China has never been interested in bilateral nuclear arms control.\n\n\"China follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense. China always keeps its nuclear strength at the minimum level required by national security, and never engages in arms race with anyone,\" said China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Xi Jinping has said he wants a world-class military, That for all intents and purposes can deny the U.S. access to the western pacific, he's told his military that they need to be ready to take Taiwan, knowing that would probably bring them in conflict with the U.S.,\" said Peters. \"We know that just last week the central committee said they need to expand the rate of nuclear weapons production and we know the Chinese are building dual capable theater range systems that can take out targets that range from Japan to northern Australia.\"\n\nKroenig says that the U.S. wants to avoid an arms race but that Russia and China have been uninterested in diplomatic deterrence.\n\n\"That's not working. Do we just leave ourselves vulnerable as they build up? Unfortunately, the only choice we're left with is that we have to build the forces now that are necessary to deter attacks against ourselves and our allies,\" Kroenig said. \"Bring it on. We'll out-compete them.\"\n\n\"Maybe this is something that will bring them to the arms-control negotiating table in the future,\" Kroenig added.", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType":

China and Russia have expanded their nuclear arsenals to achieve nuclear parity - if not advantage - over the United States by the 2030s,\" Robert Peters, former special adviser for countering weapons of mass destruction within the Obama administration's Office of the Secretary of Defense told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Inaction is not an option. A world where the United States suffers nuclear disadvantage, while our adversaries enjoy nuclear advantage, is a world where nuclear war is more likely.\"\n\nIn the Heritage Foundation report titled \"Building the Nuclear Arsenal of the 21st Century,\" first obtained by Fox News Digital before its release Tuesday, Peters highlights the dangers the U.S. faces in the wake of failed nuclear agreements and the increasingly tense geopolitical reality that Washington and its Western allies must confront.\n\nRARE DISPUTE REVEALS CHINA AND NORTH KOREA'S ONGOING DISCORD OVER NUCLEAR WEAPONS\n\nPeters, now a research fellow for nuclear deterrence with Heritage, argued the U.S. needs to abandon its long sought after policy of global nuclear disarmament, and instead Washington needs to \"expand and diversify\" its strategic arsenal.\n\nThe nuclear expert said expansions to the U.S.'s nuclear force posture should include creating a larger ballistic missile submarine force and increasing warheads on ground-based strategic deterrents.\n\nPeters also said Washington should immediately \"upload non-strategic nuclear warheads\" from its ready reserve stockpiles for \"existing theater capabilities.\"\n\nThe U.S. has over 1,300 \"retired\" warheads that have been removed from the active stockpile, but which have not yet been dismantled, according to the Arms Control Association. Russia has 1,200 \"retired\" warheads.\n\n\"These immediate steps are stopgap measures until the nuclear enterprise is able to produce plutonium pits and nuclear warheads at scale - at a rate of 80 per year by 2030 and 200 per year by 2035 - for the next generation of non-strategic nuclear weapons that are fit to purpose and meet military requirements,\" Peters detailed in his report\n\nThe report also encouraged updates to U.S. force posture by \"potentially\" stationing additional U.S. nuclear weapons across Europe, as well as introducing them to the Western Pacific.\n\nConcerns over nuclear security have been mounting for more than a year after Moscow pulled out of the 2010 New START treaty signed by President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2023.\n\nThe 2010 treaty expanded the original Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) signed in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush and Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev - which began clearing out nuclear stockpiles.\n\nThe treaty signed in 2010 limited the number of warheads the U.S. and Russia could have deployed on delivery systems like intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles or heavy bombers to no more than 1,550.\n\nPutin's decision to pull out of the nuclear agreement came after security officials had been flagging Moscow's failure to adhere to the deal and coincided with a visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has repeatedly refused to engage in any nuclear negotiations with the U.S.\n\nRUSSIA'S KREMLIN URGES 'IN-DEPTH DIALOGUE' TO EASE RISING NUCLEAR TENSIONS WITH THE WEST\n\nThe U.S. and Russia still account for 90% of the world's nuclear stockpiles, with Washington accounting for 5,044 warheads while Russia has 5,580.\n\nChina's unchecked nuclear expansion has been drawing concern for years, though for now Beijing is still believed to have just 500 warheads in its stockpiles.\n\nNorth Korea is reported to have 50 nuclear warheads.\n\nFrance, the U.K., India, Pakistan and Israel all reportedly contribute to the more than 12,100 warheads worldwide.\n\nThe strategy of deterrence was established during the Cold War between Washington and Moscow due to the threat of mutually assured destruction should there ever be a nuclear conflict.\n\nThis strategy still persists today, but thanks to technological advances of low-yield nuclear weapons, other strategic factors now affect nuclear force posture.\n\n\"Deterrence through threats of punishment is necessary, but not sufficient for the threats the United States faces,\" the report said, arguing a new approach will strengthen U.S. deterrence by also eliminating potential \"escalation pathways\" for Washington's adversaries.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, American leaders on both sides of the political spectrum have sought nuclear disarmament with Russia and other nations as the safest path forward in preventing a catastrophic nuclear event.\n\nBut Peters argued this strategy is no longer viable given an increasingly hostile international reality.\n\n\"The United States will not abandon arms control or nonproliferation goals - but it must recognize that for the time being, the global security environment does not lend itself to treaty-based arms control or other non-treaty-based risk reduction or confidence building measures,\" the report said.\n\nThe report, which is intended to be shared with the incoming administration following the November election no matter who is the victor, acknowledges that nuclear deterrence is an expensive aspect of U.S. national security, but one that is far more affordable than countering a nuclear war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"None of this will be inexpensive. Nuclear weapons currently account for between 5 and 6% of the Department of Defense budget,\" the report said, detailing that the proposed changes would likely add another 1% to 2% to total defense budget.\n\n\"Ultimately, deterring great power war - particularly nuclear war - is far less expensive than actually fighting one.,\" the report said. \"To prevent a war and ultimately prevent strategic attack... the United States must build and field a nuclear arsenal that is credible.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caitlin_mcfall@foxnews.com", "name": "Caitlin McFall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post\u2013Cold_War_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post\u2013Cold War era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "START I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deterrence theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear disarmament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weapon of mass destruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapons of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine-launched_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Submarine-launched ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_Control_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms Control Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_START", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New START"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile_submarine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile submarine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intercontinental ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plutonium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

This initiative seeks to encourage the five NPT nuclear-weapon states-namely the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China-to negotiate and conclude a treaty on \"mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons\" or to issue a political statement to this effect. This initiative is of considerable significance for avoiding a nuclear arms race, reducing strategic risks, and promoting global strategic stability.\n\nChina has consistently maintained a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons. The country has been a vocal advocate for nuclear-weapon states to commit to this principle and to refrain from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-weapon-free zones. China's efforts in this area have seen some positive results over the years. In September 1994, China and Russia mutually agreed not to use nuclear weapons against each other or to target each other with strategic nuclear weapons. Similarly, in 1999, China and the United States announced their decision not to target nuclear weapons at each other. Despite these advances, the other four NPT nuclear-weapon countries have maintained reservations about not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-weapon-free zones.\n\nChina's new proposal builds on its traditional policy stance while introducing innovative elements. The initiative outlines four key components for a \"mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons\" treaty or political statement. These components reaffirm that nuclear weapons cannot be used and nuclear war must not be fought; reiterate China's commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of all types of weapons of mass destruction; encourage the five NPT nuclear-weapon states to negotiate and conclude a treaty on \"mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons\" or issue a political statement to this effect; and note that each state party, in exercising its national sovereignty, has the right to withdraw from the treaty if extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the treaty jeopardize the supreme interests of the country. Additionally, the treaty would be of unlimited duration, and its articles would not be subject to any reservations.\n\nThese concise elements cover crucial content, including the purpose, applicability, withdrawal conditions, and duration of the initiative, providing a solid foundation for international discussions on future treaties or declarations. However, other nuclear-weapon states have thus far refused to commit to a no-first-use policy for several reasons. Firstly, they argue that such commitments are untrustworthy. Secondly, they believe that committing to no-first-use of nuclear weapons may stimulate nuclear proliferation. Some also argue that nuclear weapons have a deterrent effect on conventional conflict.\n\nFrom my perspective, these reasons and excuses are unconvincing. Commitments by nuclear-weapon states to mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons would be a significant confidence-building measure, reducing the risk of nuclear escalation during crises. If no-first-use were truly worthless, why did the Barack Obama administration once consider adopting this policy? In current regional conflicts, where the specter of nuclear war looms large, a mutual commitment to no-first-use of nuclear weapons is both realistic and meaningful.\n\nMoreover, the concept of \"extended deterrence\" is a major contributor to nuclear proliferation. It geographically spreads nuclear weapons, posing a nuclear threat to countries outside the US nuclear umbrella and impeding the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. Therefore, China suggests that relevant nuclear-weapon states abolish arrangements for \"nuclear sharing\" and \"extended deterrence\" and advocates for the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons deployed overseas.\n\nBased on practical considerations, international negotiations on a treaty on mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons can proceed step-by-step. The first step should be negotiating a legally binding treaty on \"negative security assurances,\" committing to not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and nuclear-weapon-free zones. The second step would be a political statement pledging not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons. Finally, negotiations could conclude with a treaty on \"mutual no-first-use of nuclear weapons\" or the issuing of a political statement to this effect.\n\nChina's no-first-use initiative is a pivotal step towards reducing the global nuclear threat and enhancing strategic stability. The current geopolitical climate, marked by heightened tensions and regional conflicts, necessitates bold and decisive measures to prevent nuclear escalation. The initiative not only underscores China's longstanding commitment to nuclear disarmament but also provides a pragmatic framework for other nuclear-weapon states to follow.\n\nThe successful implementation of a mutual no-first-use treaty would signify a monumental shift in nuclear policy, fostering greater trust and cooperation among the world's nuclear powers. It would also set a precedent for future disarmament efforts, paving the way for a world free of the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nChina's no-first-use of nuclear weapons initiative is a forward-thinking proposal that addresses the pressing need for nuclear risk reduction and strategic stability.

The US has 24 active agreements which will allow countries or entities to receive \"significant transfers of nuclear material or equipment\" from the US.\n\nUS firms are generally not authorised to export equipment and materials without a bilateral agreement in force, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in the United States.\n\nIn a fact sheet issued to the media on July 31, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said that any decision to deploy nuclear energy in Singapore will require \"detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in our local context\".\n\nBoth ministries said Singapore will be joining the US Department of State's Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (First) programme, which supports partners to better understand small modular reactors or other newer advanced nuclear energy technologies.\n\nSmall modular reactors are thought to be more suitable for land-scarce, population-dense Singapore as these reactors have a lower power capacity, enhanced safety standards and require much smaller buffer zones compared to conventional reactors. Such reactors have a generation capacity about one-third of traditional reactors.\n\nUnder the First programme, Singapore will gain access to a network of US entities involved in nuclear energy, including the US National Laboratories and countries developing newer nuclear energy technologies, to facilitate its capability building process.\n\nThis will support Singapore's efforts to understand and evaluate advanced nuclear energy technologies, should viable options emerge\n\n\"This agreement builds on the long-standing civil nuclear collaboration between United States and Singapore and outlines a comprehensive framework to deepen peaceful nuclear cooperation based on a mutual commitment to nuclear non-proliferation,\" said both governments in a joint statement on the signing of the US-Singapore 123 Agreement.\n\nNuclear non-proliferation is the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\n\nOnce in force, the agreement will enable deeper nuclear

But the Alliance's nuclear deterrence posture, especially in Eastern Europe, remains inadequate.\n\nTo enhance the Alliance's nuclear deterrence and counter Russia's nuclear threats, the United States should expand nuclear sharing arrangements within NATO to allies such as Poland, Finland, and Romania. The United States should also expand the presence of medium-range US ground-based dual-capable missile systems in Europe. Connected to these changes, NATO should stop adhering to the NATO-Russia Founding Act, which is limiting the Alliance's freedom and which Moscow has repeatedly violated. Only by expanding its approach to nuclear sharing can the Alliance adequately improve its deterrence posture and counter Russia's nuclear blackmail.\n\nThe spread of nuclear weapons was a major concern at the dawn of the Cold War. In 1963, US President John F. Kennedy worried about \"a world in which fifteen or twenty or twenty-five nations may have these weapons\" within a decade. NATO's current nuclear sharing program emerged in the 1960s as Washington sought to manage the proliferation of nuclear weapons and two other pressing challenges: bilateral relationships across Europe and the defense of Western European NATO allies. Of particular concern to the United States, its NATO allies, and the Soviet Union, was West Germany's desire for some sort of access to the nuclear deterrent at the heart of NATO's defense strategy.\n\nUS efforts originally focused on a \"hardware\" solution to this dilemma known as the Multilateral Force, which would have created a fleet carrying Polaris A-3 missiles under NATO command. But once Washington realized Soviet opposition to this arrangement would also kill the much-desired Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Johnson administration switched to a \"software\" approach based on training and consultation with allies -- what is now referred to as \"nuclear sharing\" within NATO. Under this arrangement US B-61 nuclear weapons are stored in secure locations in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey. The weapons are under US custody and control to maintain compliance with the NPT.\n\nIn the event of a nuclear war, a nuclear mission by NATO allies can only occur with explicit approval from NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, along with authorization by the US president and UK prime minister. France remains outside the nuclear consultation mechanism with its own sovereign nuclear force.\n\nNATO's current nuclear sharing policy, which has been detailed in various publications, is based on layers encapsulated in the 2012 Deterrence and Defence Posture Review, the post-2012 NATO summit declarations, and the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept. The doctrine deliberately avoids specificity when it comes to qualifying circumstances for nuclear weapon use.\n\nRussia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas has prompted NATO to reconsider the Alliance's previous inattention to its nuclear deterrent. The 2016 Warsaw Summit signaled this change, but despite the Alliance speaking more publicly about the nuclear issue and signaling more clearly about its nuclear exercise (Steadfast Noon), the bulk of the balancing efforts have focused on conventional forces. The problem with this, as Simond de Galbert and Jeffrey Rathke note, is that conventional parity is \"unrealistic and costly\" and perhaps even \"escalatory.\"\n\nMaking matters worse for NATO were Russia's violations of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) in 2019. Although disputed by the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin's reportedly deployed missiles (9M729) with a range of 2,500 kilometers in Mozdok, North Ossetia, and near Moscow, which was a gross violation of the treaty, placing NATO's eastern and northern allies under direct threat. In response, the United States withdrew from the INF treaty in 2019, a move that NATO allies supported.\n\nThree years later, in 2022, the Alliance once again increased its signaling on the nuclear deterrent in its Strategic Concept, saying that it would \"take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and security of the nuclear deterrent mission.\" The following year, the Alliance announced further modernization of NATO's nuclear capability at its Vilnius summit. This modernization of NATO nuclear capability is facilitated through the renewal of national forces in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as upgrades to European dual-capable aircraft. For current nuclear sharing allies, the old B-61 gravity bombs, which number around one hundred, will be replaced by the advanced B61-12. These are new weapons utilizing existing warheads and the replacement does not represent an increase in the overall number of US warheads.\n\nTo date, despite modernization and stronger signaling, NATO's nuclear posture remains stagnant. To improve the Alliance's deterrence posture, the United States and its allies should take two steps: expand current nuclear sharing arrangements eastward and deploy land-based US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.\n\nExpanding current nuclear sharing arrangements eastward will require fully breaking with the NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997, which Moscow has torn to shreds. Several allies refuse to abandon under the mistaken notion that it somehow provides a road back to peace. In practice, this has meant that the Alliance has focused on rotating conventional forces in Eastern Europe to stay within the spirit of the Founding Act.\n\nBut it is Russia, not NATO, that has destabilized Europe. Time and again, the Kremlin has blatantly ignored the Founding Act. There should be no illusions that there is a road back, and heeding the spirit of the act while Russia wages a brutal, illegal war against Ukraine and engages in political warfare against NATO allies including the United States is foolish.\n\nBalancing Russia with conventional forces in places such as the Baltics is simply an attempt at reassurance rather than an actual effective deterrence and defense strategy. Equally ineffectual would be relying just on F-35 combat aircraft in bases already storing US nuclear weapons in Europe.\n\nThe only adequate solution is to respond to Russian moves in a tit-for-tat manner that George Bunn and Rodger Payne call an iterated prisoner's dilemma. Only in responding to the Kremlin in a manner that inflicts a real price can Washington bring about eventual cooperation from the Kremlin. The United States can do this by continually raising the stakes to a point where Russia views cooperation, rather than competition, as the best solution. Given the economic strength of the United States, and nuclear allies France and Britain, it would be logical for them to impose increasing costs on Russia through expanded nuclear sharing.\n\nMoreover, the Pentagon recently announced that it would send Tomahawk, SM-6, and developmental hypersonic missiles to Germany in 2026. This is a good start, but again it does not impose a high enough price on Russian actions and a broader deployment should be considered for two reasons. First, Russia has deployed reciprocal technologies, and the current US deterrent is inadequate. Second, as noted above, the deployment of US ground-based dual-capable missile systems to NATO allies could be used as a bargaining chip to influence Russian behavior -- in effect, escalating to deescalate. While this last point may not be appreciated by all advocates of expanding NATO's deterrent, if it results in a decrease in Russian tactical nuclear deployments, it may be worth the trade if it elicits cooperation.\n\nThe United States should take a page out of the new Russian deterrent playbook, which sees little distinction between peacetime and wartime, instead favoring persistent engagement with the enemy across a range of capabilities as part of overall deterrence. Putin has time and again played Washington and its European allies, believing that they are too scared of the long shadow cast by nuclear weapons to push back against his threats. Only by responding in kind may Washington find the Kremlin perhaps willing to listen.\n\nMichael John Williams is a nonresident senior fellow with the Transatlantic Security Initiative in the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security and associate professor of international affairs and director of the International Relations Program at the Maxwell School for Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\nImage: Polish F-16s and MiG-29s escort a B1B Lancer during a training mission for Bomber Task Force Europe, May 29, 2020.

Deb Fischer, R-Neb. a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.\n\n\"[Some people] dream of the day when China, Russia and North Korea decide they want world peace. The day our enemies voluntarily dismantle their nuclear programs because America has done the same,\" said Fischer at a panel put on by the Heritage Foundation. \"We need to be clear on this: that is a fantasy. A utopian dream world.\"\n\nThe U.S. Defense Department is currently undergoing a modernization of its nuclear capabilities with the Sentinel program.\n\n\"Our nuclear deterrent is nearing a crossroads. To date, we have preserved this deterrent by extending the lifespan of legacy nuclear forces and infrastructure -- in many cases for decades beyond what was originally intended. But these systems will not remain viable indefinitely,\" Former Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva said in a report released by the Department of Defense. \"In fact, we are now at a point where we must concurrently modernize the entire nuclear triad and the infrastructure that enables its effectiveness.\"\n\nThe 2022 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the upgrade of the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a key priority for sustaining effective nuclear deterrence.\n\nPlanned over the next twenty years, modernization encompasses efforts to update each component of the nuclear triad, according to the Defense Department.\n\n\"This new ICBM system is the next evolution of missile and ground infrastructure technology, featuring significant improvements to range, accuracy, maintainability, and communications,\" according to Northrop Grumman, the Sentinel ICBMs manufacturer. \"The Sentinel system replaces the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system, which has been in service for over 50 years.\"\n\nIncreasingly, the U.S. and allies are anxious about threats from Russia and North Korea. Russia has consistently threatened the United States and Europe with nuclear attacks. North Korea has also been testing and boasting its nuclear arsenal.\n\nMany strategic arms reductions treaties have been signed and abandoned over the decades, most recently the New START Treaty between the U.S. and Russia.\n\n\"Russia has essentially cheated on every arms control treaty,\" said Matthew Kroenig, professor of Government and Foreign Service at Georgetown University. \"It is suspending compliance with, at least, parts of the New START Treaty.\"\n\nThe New START Treaty was signed by Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010 and required the deconstruction of many warheads and deployment systems. Russia reports a buildup of nuclear arms from 2012 to 2016, according to archives from the State Department.\n\nMore from this section Child knife deaths plunge sleepy UK town into 'sadness and misery' Williamsburg Soccer Club celebrates National Soccer Day Texas says Meta to pay $1.4 bn to settle photo-tagging lawsuit\n\nArsenals were required to be limited to 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers, 1,550 warheads on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs and warheads for deployed heavy bombers; and 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers.\n\nJust before the central limits took effect in 2018, Russia reported a sharp decline in their arsenal.\n\nIn February of 2023 Russia formally suspended the New START Treaty. \"There's no clause in New START for suspension,\" said Robert Peters, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \"One could make the argument that they're already in breach of New START.\"\n\n\"The threat environment has changed a lot in recent years,\" Kroenig says. \"In 2014 Russia invades Ukraine, 2022 the full scale invasion, Russia making nuclear threats, so the nuclear threat environment has gotten worse.\"\n\nKroenig mentions the Russian \"escalate-to-de escalate,\" which he says the Russians use to threaten \"limited nuclear use\" and to deter the U.S. and NATO.\n\nAccording to Kroenig, China has never been interested in bilateral nuclear arms control.\n\n\"China follows a policy of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and a nuclear strategy that focuses on self-defense. China always keeps its nuclear strength at the minimum level required by national security, and never engages in arms race with anyone,\" said China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian in a press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Xi Jinping has said he wants a world-class military, That for all intents and purposes can deny the U.S. access to the western pacific, he's told his military that they need to be ready to take Taiwan, knowing that would probably bring them in conflict with the U.S.,\" said Peters. \"We know that just last week the central committee said they need to expand the rate of nuclear weapons production and we know the Chinese are building dual capable theater range systems that can take out targets that range from Japan to northern Australia.\"\n\nKroenig says that the U.S. wants to avoid an arms race but that Russia and China have been uninterested in diplomatic deterrence.\n\n\"That's not working. Do we just leave ourselves vulnerable as they build up? Unfortunately, the only choice we're left with is that we have to build the forces now that are necessary to deter attacks against ourselves and our allies,\" Kroenig said. \"Bring it on. We'll out-compete them.\"\n\n\"Maybe this is something that will bring them to the arms-control negotiating table in the future,\" Kroenig added.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

The US will lose in a nuclear race if it resumes nuclear testing because Russia and China will quickly catch up to it, Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said in an opinion column for Foreign Affairs magazine.\n\n\"Make no mistake: the resumption of nuclear weapons testing would be bad for the United States,\" he cautioned. According to the expert, people who might serve in Washington's new administration should Republican US presidential candidate Donald Trump get re-elected, \"are once again floating the unhelpful idea of the United States resuming nuclear weapons testing.\"\n\nLewis mentioned a recent Foreign Affairs essay by Robert O'Brien, Trump's national security adviser from 2019 to 2021, who insists that Washington must test new nuclear weapons \"in the real world\" instead of \"using computer models\" in order \"to maintain technical and numerical superiority\" over Russia and China's nuclear arsenals.\n\nSuch a development may lead to Moscow and Beijing also resuming nuclear testing, Lewis thinks. According to him, Russia and China will benefit from the situation much more than the US.\n\n\"Moreover, new or emerging nuclear weapons states -- say, Iran or Saudi Arabia -- would feel no constraints against carrying out explosion tests. The result would be that the United States' nuclear-armed foes would be even more capable,\" the expert added.\n\nThe US stopped nuclear testing in 1992. The decision was made by the George Bush S. administration. In 1996, 187 countries signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), however, it has never taken effect because it was not ratified by eight countries out of 44 with nuclear weapons or means to create them, including the US. On November 2, 2023, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law according to which Moscow was revoking its CTBT ratification. As Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed, this does not mean that Russia is planning on conducting nuclear tests.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapons testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._O'Brien", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert C.

In 1954, the world's first nuclear power plant was launched in the town of Obninsk in the USSR.\n\nNowadays, nuclear energy accounts for about 10 percent of the world total energy production. Nuclear technologies have become an integral part of the life of people across the world. They are extensively used in medicine, agriculture, industry, that is, in almost every economic sector.\n\nNuclear energy is consistent with the principles of sustainable development and ensures steady supply of clean energy demonstrating the lowest life cycle \u0421\u041e2 emissions. Its contribution to addressing climate change can hardly be overestimated. Nuclear power plants operated across the world save the world greenhouse gases emissions comparable to the quantity of carbon that can be absorbed by all the planet's forests.\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nAt the moment, Russia operates 42 power units at 12 nuclear power plants with a total installed capacity of 35 GW.\n\nWe note that the future lies in closing nuclear fuel cycle (NFC). It is the closed NFC that will enable us to expand the fuel reserve of the nuclear energy by tens of times and reduce the quantity of nuclear waste by many times. Russia has been working on this.\n\nOur country pursues a strategic goal of building a two-component nuclear-energy system consisting of water-cooled, water-moderated thermal-neutron power reactors and breeder reactors closing the nuclear fuel cycle.\n\nAt the moment, Russia is operating two fast reactors. In 2022, the BN-800 reactor of the Beloyarsk NPP completely switched to uranium-plutonium fuel, that is, for the first time in the world a fast reactor started commercial operation using full load of MOX-fuel.\n\nWe are continuing the construction of a pilot energy project with BREST-OD-300 lead-cooled reactor and the infrastructure necessary to close the nuclear fuel cycle within one site. This will enable us to fine-tune technologies addressing the issue of the spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste and improve the efficiency of the nuclear power plants.\n\nRussia has been working on small and medium power reactors, including floating nuclear power plants, which are especially needed and efficient in remote areas. Russia has been operating the world's first floating nuclear thermal power plant and implementing a project of a small nuclear power plant on land.\n\nBesides, Russia is the only country running a fleet of civilian vessels with nuclear propulsion. Seven nuclear-powered icebreakers are currently operating on the Northern Sea Route, a major traffic artery connecting Europe, Russia and the Asia-Pacific.\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nRussia considers nuclear energy as an important means of achieving the United Nations' sustainable development goals. Our country has always actively promoted the development of nuclear energy across the world, and championed broad access of States to the benefits of the peaceful atom.\n\n110 power units based on USSR and Russian design have been constructed at nuclear power plants across the world. Our specialists are building 22 more high-power units in seven countries. In Turkey, four generation III+ 1200 MW power units are simultaneously constructed at Akkuyu nuclear power plant. Works to build nuclear power plants have been commenced in Hungary, Egypt and Bangladesh. New power units are under construction in China and India.\n\nMay 2024 saw the launch of the world's first export project involving the construction of a small nuclear power plant of 6 power units in Uzbekistan. In November 2023, the first Belarusian nuclear power plant started commercial operation.\n\nOur country provides over a third of the world's supply of enriched uranium and is one of the leading nuclear fuel manufacturers. Russia's priorities include scientific research into and development of radiation technologies and peaceful uses of nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture, industry and other key economic sectors. We attach special importance to training professionals in nuclear and related spheres. Over two thousand students from 65 foreign countries are currently studying in Russian universities.\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nWe assist IAEA in its efforts to ensure more efficient and wider use of nuclear energy to maintain peace, health and well-being across the world. Russia is a donor of the Agency's Technical Cooperation Fund.\n\nThe implementation of the 2017 initiative to develop nuclear infrastructure of the newcomer countries is one of the major components of our interaction with the Agency. 74 training events for over 1200 foreign experts were organized in 2017-2023 within the framework of this initiative.\n\nRussia has initiated and been a donor of the IAEA International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), which has become an advanced centre for comprehensive assessment of nuclear power systems using an extensive range of criteria. At this platform, member States can exchange information and engage in joint studies in the field of advanced nuclear technology, including Generation IV nuclear energy systems. At the moment, INPRO membership consists of 43 countries.\n\nMr. Chairman,\n\nWe would like to note the reinforcement of negative tendencies in the development of nuclear energy. They are brought about by Western countries' attempts to regain the lost leading positions and competencies in nuclear technologies using political methods against their competitors. Such steps run counter to the principles of free trade, Article IV of the NPT and the purposes and objectives of the IAEA.\n\nRussia finds inadmissible any attempts to limit the access to the benefits of peaceful atom for any State compliant with its non-proliferation obligations. Consequently, we do everything we can to counteract the use of the NPT to pursue political and economic tasks that are not directly related to the non-proliferation issues, and will continue to provide all possible assistance in using nuclear technologies to all interested States.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors":

The US has 24 active agreements which will allow countries or entities to receive \"significant transfers of nuclear material or equipment\" from the US.\n\nUS firms are generally not authorised to export equipment and materials without a bilateral agreement in force, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in the United States.\n\nIn a fact sheet issued to the media on July 31, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said that any decision to deploy nuclear energy in Singapore will require \"detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in our local context\".\n\nBoth ministries said Singapore will be joining the US Department of State's Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (First) programme, which supports partners to better understand small modular reactors or other newer advanced nuclear energy technologies.\n\nSmall modular reactors are thought to be more suitable for land-scarce, population-dense Singapore's as these reactors have a lower power capacity, enhanced safety standards and require much smaller buffer zones compared to conventional reactors. Such reactors have a generation capacity about one-third of traditional reactors.\n\nUnder the First programme, Singapore will gain access to a network of US entities involved in nuclear energy, including the US National Laboratories and countries developing newer nuclear energy technologies, to facilitate its capability building process.\n\nThis will support Singapore's efforts to understand and evaluate advanced nuclear energy technologies, should viable options emerge.\n\n\"This agreement builds on the long-standing civil nuclear collaboration between United States and Singapore and outlines a comprehensive framework to deepen peaceful nuclear cooperation based on a mutual commitment to nuclear nonproliferation,\" said both governments in a joint statement on the signing of the US-Singapore 123 agreement.\n\nNuclear nonproliferation is the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology.\n\nOnce in force, the agreement will enable deeper nuclear cooperation, consistent with the highest international standards of safety, security, and nonproliferation, the statement added.\n\n\"(This will) build on our strong bilateral partnership\", said both

They include the Philippines - which signed the deal last year - Indonesia and Vietnam. Other Asian signatories of the deal include China, India, Japan and South Korea.\n\nWith the 123 Agreement, Singapore can better understand advanced reactor designs and commercial developments. SMRs in particular could be a game-changer for the land-constrained country, as such reactors could potentially be as small as a quarter of a football pitch.\n\nNuclear power, which does not produce direct carbon emissions, could also help Singapore achieve its target of hitting net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe country currently relies on natural gas for about 94 per cent of its fuel mix. But nuclear power could supply about 10 per cent of its needs by 2050, a 2022 report commissioned by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) found.\n\nThe deal would further facilitate knowledge transfer, training programmes, and technical assistance, allowing academics, businesses and government entities to collaborate.\n\nIt would also allow Singapore to deepen its participation in regional and international cooperation on nuclear safety.\n\nSingapore's signing of the agreement comes amid renewed interest in nuclear power throughout South-east Asia.\n\nBack in 2012, a nuclear pre-feasibility study by Singapore found that the nuclear energy technologies available then were not suitable for country yet, with the risks still outweighing the benefits.\n\nBut a decade on, the 2022 EMA report noted that recent advancements in nuclear technology have made it more safe and reliable. It recommended tracking developments not just in SMRs, but also in fusion reactors.\n\nNuclear fusion is an even more nascent technology, where instead of splitting uranium, nuclear power is generated from the fusion of hydrogen, mimicking how the sun produces energy. Unlike fission reactors, fusion technologies could still be decades away.\n\nDeciding whether to deploy nuclear power \"will require detailed studies of the safety, reliability, affordability, and environmental sustainability of nuclear energy in our local context,\" the government said in a factsheet on Wednesday.\n\nIn the meantime, Singapore continues to deepen its research into advanced nuclear technologies. A new multimillion-dollar research building at the National University of Singapore, for instance, is set to support about 100 nuclear researchers.\n\nSeparately, Nanyang Technological University last year set up a research centre for nuclear fusion with France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, called the Singapore Alliance with France for Fusion Energy.\n\nThe city-state also aims to train at least 100 experts on nuclear safety in the medium to long term, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said last year.\n\nIn joining the US' First programme, Singapore will gain access to the network of US entities involved in civilian nuclear energy, including the US National Laboratories and companies developing newer nuclear energy technologies.\n\nThe US had already been supporting Singapore's efforts to understand advanced nuclear energy technologies. For instance, since 2017, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Singapore's National Environment Agency have collaborated on nuclear safety matters and held a joint workshop in July.\n\nOther countries in the First programme include The Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Estonia.", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"},

In managing this threat, North Korean \"denuclearization\" would represent a futile objective. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and nuclear posture are a fait accompli. Plausibly, they are irreversible.\n\nFor the United States, this means that meaningful remedies for Kim Jong Un's threatening nuclear capabilities and ambitions will have to be sought in more promising expectations. In the final analysis, viable American remedies should coalesce around requirements of credible nuclear deterrence.[1]Recalling former and re-aspiring US President Donald J. Trump's Singapore Summit declaration, it will not be enough for the two leaders to \"fall in love\" again. Whoever wins the 2024 election, that successful candidate will need to prioritize tangible intellectual substance over irrelevant photo opportunities.\n\nPast could become prologue. Fundamental and substantial policy errors were committed by former President Donald Trump, and there is little reason to believe that he would now suddenly value analytic substance over distracting entertainments. Though getting Kim Jong Un to reverse his aggressive posture on nuclear weapons would be welcome news for any American president, no such news should be reasonably anticipated. Much as we might wish it were otherwise, the nations in world politics do not yet coexist in a logic-based international order.[2]\n\nMultiple questions are spawned by this narrative. What ought to be done by the United States concerning a North Korean nuclear crisis or nuclear war? What sort of time-line should be applied? How should America proceed in this bewildering cauldron of regional instability? What if already nuclear North Korea comes to the assistance of its not-yet-nuclear Iranian ally contra Israel? Could such an unexpected nuclear surrogacy involve the United States, Russia and/or China?\n\nThese questions don't have easily discernible answers. For the most part, nuclear geopolitical issues involving North Korea would be without clarifying historical precedent. These issues would be sui generis; some promising remedies would be counter-intuitive.\n\nThough North Korea's nuclear arsenal and infrastructures are \"less powerful\" than America's (at least from the standpoint of still-calculable range/yield measures), they are nonetheless capable of producing unacceptable levels of devastation in the United States, South Korea or Japan. Even if America's \"missile interception reliability\" were conspicuously high, nothing short of 100% reliability could suffice vis-\u00e0-vis enemy nuclear weapons.\n\nNo individual state should reasonably expect perfect levels of missile interception reliability. Nothing science-based could be estimated regarding actual event probabilities. In logic and mathematics, valid statements of probability must always be based on the determinable frequency of pertinent past events. In the opaque matters at hand, there are no such events.[3]\n\nFor the next American president, there should be only one analytically defensible and law-enforcing stance toward North Korea. This means a determinably coherent posture of long-term mutual deterrence.[4] Accordingly, prudent and concept-based decision-making will be indispensable. Among other things, any US president would need to take scrupulous care never to exaggerate or overstate America's military power advantage[5] or its associated risk-taking calculus.\n\nVarious jurisprudential clarifications are now in order. From the standpoint of international law, there is no plausible contradiction between enhanced nuclear deterrence and world legal order. Rather, in our anarchic or \"Westphalian\" system of international law (a system bequeathed at the Peace of Westphalia in 1648), law enforcement must ultimately rely upon continuously intersecting mechanisms of \"self-help.\" In this stratified \"state of nature,\" international conflict can be managed only via assorted stratagems of threat, counter-threat and manipulations of \"balance.\"\n\nThere is more. These stratagems are augmented and tempered by multiple and intersecting regimes of treaties, customs and \"the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations.\"[6] But the de facto final arbiters of world politics are necessarily those state and regional actors who can present most persuasively as \"powerful.\"\n\nIn the best of all possible worlds, greater global centralization or governance would replace \"balance of power\" or Realpolitik dynamics. Still, for the foreseeable future, the core deterrence logic of world power politics will likely continue. From the properly valued standpoint of international law enforcement, this conclusion is not problematic. As a viscerally primal species, we are not yet ready for the flawed logic of belligerent nationalism to be discarded.\n\nEven with a reasonable and reasoning US president, American military planners will remain limited in their capacity to learn meaningfully from the pre-nuclear past. Looking ahead, preventing nuclear war with North Korea should never again become a clownish or seat-of-the-pants decisional process. Never again should US national security calculations become a self-parodying presidential sideshow dominated by mountebanks, rented \"intellectuals\" and rabid pitchmen. To make a point that has never really been understood, the primary battlefield of any future nuclear war would be intellectual.[7]\n\nThese are complex and potentially synergistic matters.[8] In all such matters, decisional caution should become the cardinal watchword.[9] By definition, there are no \"go to\" experts on the subject of nuclear war, either civilian or military. As there has never been such a war,[10] there could be no way for American planners or decision-makers to calculate the mathematical probability of any US-North Korea nuclear conflict, whether begun as a direct bilateral belligerency or as \"spillover\" from other parts of Asia and/or the Middle East.\n\nSeen from within these fixed parameters, there exist ample policy grounds for greater US strategic \"humility.\" For the next American president, this is certainly not a proper time for gratuitous bellicosity, overweening pride or hubris. For an American president, it is always the correct time to display decision-making modesty in the country's nuclear dealings with Kim Jong Un. When a prospectively belligerent path for a nation-state has never been walked before (e.g., nuclear warfare), it is incumbent on the calculating \"traveler\" to advance slowly, purposefully and with recognizable deliberateness.\n\nThere is more. All relevant strategic issues involving the United States and North Korea will concern many-sided matters of science, law and logic. These issues ought never to be considered merely as matters of wishful thinking or constructed faith. Though Trump's original reference to his June 12, 2018 Singapore Summit with Kim Jong Un described an occasion where the two leaders \"fell in love,\" there remain no detectable or residual benefits to this \"romance.\" None at all.[11]\n\nRegarding the North Korea nuclear problem, erudition should have its US policy-shaping pride of place. To wit, the American president will need to bear in mind that certain continuously transforming strategic developments across the Asian-Pacific region will inevitably be impacted by \"Cold War II.\" At its core, this \"war\" references an ongoing and primary oppositional stance with Russia, and - more or less derivatively - China.\n\nMore US planning precision will be required. How shall the United States best act vis-\u00e0-vis adversarial nuclear uncertainties? Proceeding with time-urgent considerations of US - North Korea policy, all significant US strategic calculations will be fraught with intersecting, overlapping and daunting uncertainties. It will be necessary for any American president and his designated counselors to remain ready to offer best available war-peace estimations.[12]\n\nAmong all potential causal factors - some of them maximally interdependent or authentically \"synergistic\" - the calculable risks of a nuclear war between Washington and Pyongyang (or between Pyongyang and South Korea) will depend on whether such a conflict would be intentional, unintentional or accidental. In these bewildering calculations, refined strategic theory would become an indispensable \"net.\" Ipso facto, only those who \"cast\" could expect to \"catch.\"\n\nSome further clarifications will be needed. Any accidental nuclear war between the US and North Korea would be unintentional or inadvertent, but not all unintentional nuclear wars would be the result of an accident. Sometime, an unintentional nuclear war could be the result of decisional miscalculation or irrationality by either one or both of the two contending presidents. Such a worrisome understanding is realistic on its face, and ought to underscore the analysis-based need for US presidential humility.\n\nThere is still more to know. Facing future North Korean negotiations, it will be necessary that competent US policy analysts systematically examine and measure variously dynamic configurations of foreseeable nuclear risk. When expressed in the game-theoretic parlance of formal military planning, these shifting configurations could present themselves singly or one-at-a-time (the expectedly best case for Washington). They could also arise suddenly, unexpectedly, with apparent diffusiveness and in multiple or overlapping \"cascades.\"[13]\n\nWhatever their nuances, these examinations will be comprehensively intellectualtasks, not narrowly political ones. To understand such determinative \"cascades\" will require carefully-honed, well-developed and formidable analytic skills. This will not be a graspable task for the intellectually faint-hearted or narrowly partisan politicians. It will require manifestly rare combinations of historical acquaintance, law-based erudition and previously well-demonstrated capacities for advanced dialectical thinking. This assessment points to a task that will require thinkers who are as comfortable elucidating the prescriptions of Plato,[14] Descartes and Grotius as they are with the more expressly technical elements of strategic nuclear planning.\n\nNeither Washington nor Pyongyang is likely paying sufficient attention to the grave and potentially intersecting risks of unintentional nuclear war. To this point in their ongoing bilateral relations, each president would seem to assume the other's decision-making rationality. If, after all, there were no such mutual assumption, it could make no sense for either side to negotiate nuclear security accommodations with the other.\n\nFor the American president, relevant goals should be made plain. Stable and viable deterrence, not Pyongyang's \"denuclearization,\" should represent the overriding US strategic goal opposite North Korea. This complex goal remains contingent upon certain basic assumptions concerning incremental nuclear arms control and enemy rationality.\n\nBut are such assumptions valid in the case of potential war between two already-nuclear powers? If not, if a US president should sometime fear overt enemy irrationalityin Pyongyang, more explicit threats of US retaliation might only make matters substantially less stable. This is especially worrisome if the new threats were expressly disproportionate.\n\nIn the past, before \"falling in love\" with Kim Jung Un, and as part of an escalating bravado detached from any secure intellectual moorings, Donald Trump favored such vaporous threats as \"complete annihilation\" and \"total destruction.\" For the future, no such shallow preferences could ever stand a chance of meeting America's core national security goals. Going forward, what might once have sounded \"tough\" to followers of a proudly anti-intellectual American president could only impair US nuclear deterrent persuasiveness. In such cases, contrived images of American toughness could actually produce unprecedented lethality.\n\nAt some point, if it is once again made contingent upon politics-driven bellicosity,[15]American national security could come to depend on viable combinations of ballistic missile defense and defensive first strikes. Settling upon such untested combinations would lack decisional input from any material or quantifiable historical evidence and would prove existentially risky. In a conceivably worst case scenario, the offensive military element would entail a situational preemption - that is, a defensive first strike. At that portentous point, there would remain no \"ordinary\" circumstances wherein a preemptive strike[16] against an already-nuclear North Korea could still be rational.\n\nIn Washington's nuclear relations with Pyongyang, none of these decisions should be made casually or without substantive intellectual foundations. More precisely, with the expanding development of \"hypersonic\" nuclear weapons, determining optimal US policy combinations from one crisis to another would quickly become overwhelming. Though counterintuitive, the fact that the United States is recognizably \"more powerful\" than North Korea could prove effectively irrelevant. Even worse, it could become the underlying cause of an actual military nuclear engagement between two adversarial nuclear states.\n\nSome years back, Donald Trump, speaking of Kim Jong Un, bragged that though both leaders have a nuclear \"button,\" \"my button is bigger than yours.\"\n\nIn urgent matters of national nuclear strategy, however, size might not really matter. Concerning arcane matters of strategic nuclear deterrence, even a seemingly \"weaker\" nuclear force could sometime inflict unacceptable harms. In such historically unique matters, the weaker party could remain fully capable of wreaking \"assuredly destructive\" retaliations.\n\nIn all such more-or-less foreseeable circumstances, there would obtain various overlapping issues of law and strategy. Under international law, which remains an integral part of US law,[17] the option of a selective or comprehensive defensive first-strike might be correctly characterized as \"anticipatory self-defense.\" Juridical correctness would apply only if the American side could argue persuasively that the \"danger posed\" by North Korea was \"imminent in point of time.\"\n\nDiscernible \"imminence\" is specifically required by the relevant standards of international law[18] - that is, by authoritative criteria established and codified after an 1837 naval incident famously called \"The Caroline.\"[19] Today, however, in the infinitely perplexing nuclear age, precise characterizations of \"imminence\" could prove sorely abstract or densely problematic. What then?\n\nFor the time being, it seems plausible that Kim Jong Un would value his own personal life and that of his nation above any other conceivable preference or combination of preferences. In corresponding scenarios, moreover, Kim would be presumed technically rational, and remain subject to US nuclear deterrence. But it could still be important for a negotiating American president to distinguish accurately between authentic instances of enemy irrationality and instances of feigned or pretended enemy irrationality.\n\nThere is still more. Such an expectation might not be easily satisfied in the midst of any already-ongoing nuclear crisis; that is, in extremis atomicum. As for the potential effects of future disease pandemic upon accurate adversarial assessments, these could prove significant. But they could also prove indecipherable.\n\nAlthough neither side would likely seek a shooting war, especially if both adversaries were fully rational, either or both heads of state could still commit catastrophic errors in offering individualized strategic choices. Such errors would likely represent an unintended consequence of jointly competitive searches for \"escalation dominance.\"[20] Arguably, these sorts of prospectively crucial errors are more apt to occur in circumstances where one or both presidents had chosen to reignite law-threatening exclamations of belligerent bravado.\n\nAn inadvertent nuclear war between Washington and Pyongyang could take place not only as the result of misunderstandings or miscalculations between rational national leaders, but also as the unintended consequence (singly or synergistic) of mechanical, electrical, computer malfunctions, or of certain \"hacking\"-type interventions. These interventions could include still-unprecedented intrusions of \"cyber-mercenaries.\"\n\nWhat essential \"nuclear bargaining\" dynamics ought now to be studied? In any crisis between Washington and Pyongyang, each side would expectedly strive to maximize two overriding goals at the same time. These objectives are (1) to dominate the dynamic and largely unpredictable process of nuclear crisis escalation; and (2) to achieve desired levels of \"escalation dominance\" without sacrificing vital national security obligations. This second objective means preventing one's own state and society from suffering catastrophic or existential harms.\n\nWhat is the strategic \"bottom line\" for an American president? All underlying issues of adversarial contention between Washington and Pyongyang are enormously complicated and subject to irremediable failure. Faced with such daunting complexities - operational and legal[21] - each side should proceed warily, in deliberate fashion, and with a posture that is militarily purposeful and prudentially risk-averse. Reciprocally, any aggressive over-confidence by either president will have to be scrupulously avoided.\n\nThough such sound advice cannot be gainfully communicated to Kim Jong Un, the American president will still have to fashion this country's law-supporting strategy upon dispassionate analyses and reason-based theory. Whatever its particular nuances, and whether it is expected or unexpected, such theory should point convincingly to realistic and still-achievable goals. Though it would be nice, in the best of all possible worlds, for Kim to accept some form of denuclearization, this is not yet the best of all possible worlds. Or as they would say \"back home in Indiana\" - \"not hardly.\"\n\nThe core policy \"lesson\" here should be unambiguous. Whatever an American president's apparent preferences, this country's pertinent security goals should not include North Korean denuclearization. Whatever its particular methods of expression, bargaining and operation, Washington's strategic theory about Pyongyang should continuously emphasize will-based policies of strategic dissuasion.[22] Soon, for the American president, creating and sustaining stable nuclear deterrence with North Korea will represent the only game in town. Preparing to play this \"game\" effectively and expeditiously is far more important than any alleged presidential \"attitude.\"[23]\n\nIn Chapter 18 of his classic Gallic War, Julius Caesar comments: \"Men as a rule willingly believe what they want to believe.\" Understood in terms of current US foreign policy toward North Korean nuclear dangers, this observation suggests the futility of believing that Pyongyang would ever exchange its nuclear armaments for expanded financial incentives. In order to respond realistically to Kim Jong Un's expansion of missile provocations, Washington's only correct response should be based on a strategic reality that Americans may simply not want to believe.\n\nRegarding North Korea, US strategic policies should continuously emphasize the centrality of stable nuclear deterrence. Among other things, this means a refined focus on (1) the expected rationality or irrationality of key decision-makers in North Korea; (2) the cumulative requirements of escalation dominance; and (3) the always-important distinctions between intentional, unintentional and accidental nuclear war.\n\nIn these matters, recalling philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, \"The laws of physics are decrees of fate.\"\n\n[1] See, by this author, Louis Ren\u00e9 Beres (Pentagon): https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/united-states-nuclear-strategy-deterrence-escalation-and-war\n\n[2] On the continuing attractions of ant-reason, see: Karl Jaspers, Reason and anti-Reason in Our Time (1952): \"There is something inside all of us that earns not for reason, but for mystery - not for penetrating clear thought but for the whisperings of the irrational....\" (p. 67).\n\n[3] North Korean nuclear-knowhow could impact other regions of the world. In this connection, Pyongyang has had significant nuclear dealings with Syria. Earlier, North Korea helped Syria build a nuclear reactor, the same facility that was later destroyed by Israel in its Operation Orchard, on September 6, 2007. Although, unlike earlier Operation Opera (June 7, 1981) this preemptive attack, in the Deir ez-Zor region, was presumptively a second expression of the so-called \"Begin Doctrine,\" it also illustrated, because of the North Korea-Syria connection, a wider globalthreat to US ally, Israel. See also: https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2017-09-06/10-years-later-israels-operation-orchard-offers-lessons-on-north-korea\n\n[4] To be maximally effective and law-enforcing, this posture must be combined with systematic and verifiable patterns of nuclear arms control. Prima facie, the long-term reliability of nuclear deterrence would necessarily be incompatible with any no-holds barred nuclear arms race. In essence, what is being proposed here is a \"middle position\" between total North Korean denuclearization (which is infeasible) and an unrestricted nuclear arms race (which would be radically destabilizing and intolerable).\n\n[5] From the standpoint of stable nuclear deterrence, the likelihood of actual nuclear conflict between states could sometime be inversely related to the plausibly expected magnitude of catastrophic harms. This is only an \"informal\" presumption, however, because we are here considering a unique or unprecedented event, one of very limited predictive capacity precisely because is sui generis.\n\n[6] From Art 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.\n\n[7] In contrast to today's national political leaderships, the Founding Fathers of the United States were serious intellectuals. Explained succinctly by the distinguished American historian Richard Hofstadter: \"The Founding Fathers were sages, scientists, men of broad cultivation, many of them apt in classical learning, who used their wide reading in history, politics and law to solve the exigent problems of their time.\" See Hofstadter's Anti-Intellectualism in American Life (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1964), p. 145. To be sure, we can detect elements of sexism and racism in these commending characterizations, but such sentiments should be viewed within their specific 18th century context.\n\n[8] In synergistic interactions, whether in chemistry, medicine, or world politics, the \"whole\" of any combination must exceed the sum of its \"parts.\"\n\n[9] \"Everything is very simple in war,\" says Clausewitz, in his classical discussion of \"friction\" in On War, \"but the simplest thing is difficult.\" Herein, this concept refers to the unpredictable effects of errors in knowledge and information concerning US-North Korea strategic uncertainties; on US and North Korean under-estimations or over-estimations of relative power position; and on the unalterably vast and largely irremediable differences between theories of deterrence, and enemy intent \"as it actually is.\" See: Carl von Clausewitz, \"Uber das Leben und den Charakter von Scharnhorst,\" Historisch-politische Zeitschrift, 1 (1832); cited in Barry D. Watts, Clausewitzian Friction and Future War, McNair Paper No. 52, October, 1996, Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University Washington, D.C. p. 9.\n\n[10] The atomic bombings of Japan in August 1945 did not constitute an authentic nuclear war, but \"only\" the use of nuclear weapons in an otherwise conventional conflict. Significant, too, following Hiroshima and Nagasaki, no other atomic bombs existed anywhere on earth.\n\n[11] Throughout history, geopolitics or Realpolitik have often been associated with personal immortality. In his posthumously published lecture on Politics (1896), German historian Heinrich von Treitschke observed: \"Individual man sees in his own country the realization of his earthly immortality.\" Earlier, German philosopher Georg Friedrich Hegel opined, in his Philosophy of Right (1820), that the state represents \"the march of God in the world.\" The \"deification\" of Realpolitik, a transformation from mere principle of action to a sacred end in itself, drew its originating strength from the doctrine of sovereignty advanced in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Initially conceived as a principle of internal order, this doctrine underwent a specific metamorphosis, whence it became the formal or justifying rationale for international anarchy - that is, for the global \"state of nature.\" First established by Jean Bodin as a juristic concept in De Republica (1576), sovereignty came to be regarded as a power absolute and above the law. Understood in terms of modern international relations, this doctrine encouraged the notion that states lie above and beyond any form of legal regulation in their interactions with each other.\n\n[12] Under authoritative international law, the question of whether or not a \"state of war\" exists between states can be ambiguous. Traditionally, it was held that a formal declaration of war was necessary before a true state of war could be said to exist. Hugo Grotius divided wars into declared wars, which were legal, and undeclared wars, which were not. (See Hugo Grotius, The Law of War and Peace, Bk. III, Chaps. III, IV, and XI.) By the start of the twentieth century, the position that war obtains only after a conclusive declaration of war by one of the parties was codified by Hague Convention III. This treaty stipulated that hostilities must never commence without a \"previous and explicit warning\" in the form of a declaration of war or an ultimatum. (See Hague Convention III Relative to the Opening of Hostilities, 1907, 3 NRGT, 3 series, 437, article 1.) Currently, declarations of war may be tantamount to admissions of international criminality because of the express criminalization of aggression; it could therefore represent a clear jurisprudential absurdity to tie any true state of war to formal and prior declarations of belligerency. It follows, inter alia, that a state of war may now exist without any formal declarations, but only if there exists an actual armed conflict between two or more states and/or at least one of these affected states considers itself \"at war.\"\n\n[13] Regarding authoritative international law, there could be coinciding jurisprudential concerns expressed about the crime of \"aggression.\" See especially: RESOLUTION ON THE DEFINITION OF AGGRESSION, Dec. 14, 1974, U.N.G.A. Res. 3314 (XXIX), 29 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 31) 142, U.N. Doc. A/9631, 1975, reprinted in 13 I.L.M. 710, 1974; and CHARTER OF THE UNITED NATIONS, Art. 51... Done at San Francisco, June 26, 1945. Entered into force for the United States, Oct. 24, 1945, 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993, Bevans 1153, 1976, Y.B.U.N. 1043.\n\n[14] \"Dialectic\" is Plato's term for what science and philosophy \"do.\" It is rooted in the Greek word for conversation, and stipulates that only through conversation can one genuinely discover \"what each thing is\" (Republic 533b).\n\n[15] The belligerent nationalismof Donald Trump stands in marked contrast to authoritative legal assumptions concerning inter-state solidarity. Among other things, these jurisprudential assumptions concern a presumptively common legal struggle against aggression and terrorism. Such a \"peremptory\" expectation, known formally in law as a jus cogens assumption, were already mentioned in Justinian, Corpus Juris Civilis (533 CE); Hugo Grotius, 2 De Jure Belli ac Pacis Libri Tres, Ch. 20 (Francis W. Kesey., tr, Clarendon Press, 1925) (1690); and Emmerich de Vattel, 1 Le Droit des Gens, Ch. 19 (1758).\n\n[16] From a jurisprudential standpoint, it is necessary to distinguish preemptive attacks from preventive attacks. More precisely, preemption is a military strategy of striking first in the expectation that the only foreseeable alternative is to be struck first oneself. A preemptive attack is launched by a state that believes enemy forces are about to attack. A preventive attack is launched not out of any genuine concern about \"imminent\" hostilities, but rather for fear of a longer-term deterioration in a pertinent military balance. In a preemptive attack, the length of time by which the enemy's action is anticipated is presumptively very short; in a preventive strike, the anticipated interval is considerably longer. A related problem here for the United States is not only the practical difficulty of accurately determining \"imminence,\" but also that by delaying a defensive strike until appropriately ascertained urgencies can be acknowledged could prove \"fatal.\"\n\n[17] In the words used by the U.S. Supreme Court in The Paquete Habana, \"International law is part of our law, and must be ascertained by the courts of justice of appropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending upon it are duly presented for their determination. For this purpose, where there is no treaty, and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the customs and usages of civilized nations.\" See The Paquete Habana, 175 U.S. 677, 678-79 (1900). See also: The Lola, 175 U.S. 677 (1900); Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, 726 F. 2d 774, 781, 788 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (per curiam) (Edwards, J. concurring) (dismissing the action, but making several references to domestic jurisdiction over extraterritorial offenses), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1003 (1985) (\"concept of extraordinary judicial jurisdiction over acts in violation of significant international standards...embodied in the principle of 'universal violations of international law.'\").\n\n[18] Regarding the sources of international law, see art. 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice: STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE, Done at San Francisco, June 26, 1945. Entered into force, Oct. 24, 1945; for the United States, Oct. 24, 1945. 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993, 3 Bevans 1153, 1976 Y.B.U.N., 1052.\n\n[19] The precise origins of anticipatory self-defense under international law lie in the Caroline, a case that concerned the unsuccessful rebellion of 1837 in Upper Canada against British rule. Following this case, the serious threat of armed attack has generally justified certain militarily defensive actions. In an exchange of diplomatic notes between the governments of the United States and Great Britain, then U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster outlined a framework for self-defense that did not require an antecedent attack. Here, the jurisprudential framework permitted a military response to a threat so long as the danger posed was \"instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.\" See: Beth M. Polebaum, \"National Self-defense in International Law: An Emerging Standard for a Nuclear Age,\" 59 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 187, 190-91 (1984) (noting that the Caroline case had transformed the right of self-defense from an excuse for armed intervention into a legal doctrine). Still earlier, see: Hugo Grotius, Of the Causes of War, and First of Self-Defense, and Defense of Our Property, reprinted in 2 Classics of International Law, 168-75 (Carnegie Endowment Trust, 1925) (1625); and Emmerich de Vattel, The Right of Self-Protection and the Effects of the Sovereignty and Independence of Nations, reprinted in 3 Classics of International Law, 130 (Carnegie Endowment Trust, 1916) (1758). Also, Samuel Pufendorf, The Two Books on the Duty of Man and Citizen According to Natural Law, 32 (Frank Gardner Moore., tr., 1927 (1682).\n\n[20]See earlier by this author, Louis Ren\u20ac Beres: https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/3/miscalculating-north-korea/\n\n[21] International law remains \"Westphalian.\" See: Treaty of Peace of Munster, Oct. 1648, 1 Consol. T.S. 271; and Treaty of Peace of Osnabruck, Oct. 1648, 1., Consol. T.S. 119, Together, these two treaties comprise the Peace of Westphalia.\n\n[22] The modern philosophic origins of \"will\" lie in the writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, especially The World as Will and Idea (1818). For his own inspiration, Schopenhauer drew freely upon poet and dramatist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Later, Nietzsche drew just as freely and perhaps more importantly upon Schopenhauer. Goethe was also a core intellectual source for Spanish existentialist Jose Ortega y'Gasset, author of the singularly prophetic twentieth-century work, The Revolt of the Masses (Le Rebelion de las Masas (1930). See, accordingly, Ortega's very grand essay, \"In Search of Goethe from Within\" (1932), written for Die Neue Rundschau of Berlin on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's death. It is reprinted in Ortega's anthology, The Dehumanization of Art (1948), and is available from Princeton University Press (1968).\n\n[23] When meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un on June 11, 2018, Trump dismissed all usual presidential leadership obligations to capably prepare. Instead, he emphasized, again and again: \"I don't think I have to prepare very much.

The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has also cast a spotlight on the risk of nuclear weapons being deployed.\n\nIsrael has never confirmed if it possesses a nuclear arsenal, maintaining a policy of strategic ambiguity throughout the region, though some experts believe it does have a small arsenal. Its bitter enemy Iran does not posses nuclear weapons, but is feared to be trying to develop them in nuclear facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, according to calculations from the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) pressure group, global spending on nuclear weapons is estimated to have increased by 13 per cent to a record $91.4 billion during 2023, the Guardian. This has been partly driven by a sharp increase in US defence budgets.\n\nIn his address to a UN committee on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Vatican News, the archbishop highlighted that a distinctive feature of Vatican diplomacy on nuclear issues is that - contrary to the doctrine of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), whereby if two opponents both have nuclear weapons they will never be able to use them as each would then wipe the other out - even the possession of nuclear weapons, even for deterrence, is morally wrong.\n\nThe archbishop added that Pope Francis of both manufacturing and possessing nuclear weapons during his visit to Nagasaki in 2019. He then went on to say that the Holy See is concerned both by the \"continuing growth in military expenditure related to nuclear weapons\" and the \"increase in rhetoric and threats about their possible use\". Such actions, he said, are \"an affront to humanity as a whole\".\n\nAll nine of the world's nuclear armed nations are spending more, the Guardian reports, with the US remaining the biggest spender on nuclear weapons (estimated to be $51.5 billion). China is judged to be the second largest spender with a budget of $11.9 billion. Russia is the third largest spender, at $8.3 billion, followed by the UK ($8.1 billion) and France ($6.1 billion).\n\nThe US Air Force's strategic bomber fleet continues to consist of the B-52H Stratofortress, which has been in service since the 1950s, and the B-2 Spirit, which entered service in the late 1990s, the US Air Force (USAF) says:\n\n\"A dramatic leap forward in technology, the bomber represents a major milestone in the U.S. bomber modernisation program. The B-2 brings massive firepower to bear, in a short time, anywhere on the globe through previously impenetrable defences.\"\n\nThe USAF is upgrading and modernising its existing bomber fleet and exploring the options for a future, next-generation bomber, which is expected to be a stealthy, long-range bomber similarly capable to the B-2 of carrying both nuclear and conventional payloads.\n\nArchbishop Balestrero presented three proposals from the Holy See believes to address the current increase in nuclear rhetoric and spending.\n\nFirstly, he said, it is important to recognise that non-proliferation and disarmament, in addition to being legal obligations, are \"ethical responsibilities towards all members of the human family\".\n\nQuoting Pope Francis during his Nagasaki visit, the archbishop stated: \"Peace and international stability are incompatible with attempts to build upon the fear of mutual destruction or the threat of total annihilation. They can be achieved only on the basis of a global ethic of solidarity and cooperation.\"\n\nThe second proposal is the need for \"sincere dialogue\" aimed at reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles worldwide.\n\nFinally, the archbishop noted that the money spent on nuclear weapons could be better spent on humanitarian projects. As a result, he reiterated the Holy See's long-time proposal of establishing a global poverty fund, financed with \"portions of the money otherwise spent on weapons and other military expenditures\".\n\nClosing his address, Archbishop Balestrero reaffirmed the Holy See's \"firm conviction\" that a world free of nuclear weapons is \"both possible and necessary\".\n\nPhoto: In this handout photo provided by the US Air Force, a B-2 bomber flies over Edwards Air Force Base in California, USA, 14 August 2003.

Indonesia and Vietnam's respective deals with the US came into force in 1981 and 2014, while the Philippines' agreement with the US entered into force earlier this month on Jul 2.\n\n123 Agreements provide a legal framework for peaceful nuclear cooperation such as the export of nuclear material, equipment, and components from the United States to another country, according to the US Department of State's website.\n\nIn addition, they also facilitate cooperation in other areas, such as educational and technological transfers and collaborations between US and partner countries.\n\nPartners are held by a set of non-proliferation requirements to guarantee that the information obtained through this agreement will only be used for peaceful purposes.\n\nUS Congress approval is needed for the

They highlight the potential risks associated with maintaining such powerful weapons, including accidental launches and the escalation of conflicts.\n\nProponents, on the other hand, insist that modernizing the nuclear arsenal is crucial for national security. They believe that a robust and reliable deterrent is necessary to prevent adversaries from considering a nuclear strike against the US.\n\nThe discussion around the Pentagon's plan has brought renewed attention to the complexities and ethical considerations of nuclear deterrence. As the debate continues, it remains to be seen how this significant investment will shape the future of US military strategy and global stability.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The Americans and Israelis denied it.\n\nHowever, Tehran stuck with its claims and convicted and hanged Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, two years later, who it alleged was a spy for Mossad and had received \u00a372,000 for the murder.\n\nIn 2011, gunmen riding motorcycles fatally shot Darioush Rezai-Nejad, 35, an Iranian scientist in front of his house in Tehran, also wounding his wife.\n\nIt was uncertain what role, if any, he was playing in the nuclear sphere, but unconfirmed Israeli intelligence reports at the time said he was working on a nuclear detonator and had been seen daily at a nuclear laboratory in the north of the capital.\n\nHis shooting came at a time of growing Western concerns that Iran may be accelerating its production of nuclear materials to progress towards making a weapon.\n\nIt also followed an assassination attempt against Fereydoon Abbasi, the nuclear physicist running the country's atomic energy organisation.\n\nDr Abbasi had been driving to work when a motorcyclist attached an explosive device to the door of his car, but he managed to escape, dragging his wife with him.\n\nOn the same day, Majid Shahriari, a colleague on the faculty of Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University and who the Iranians said was managing a major nuclear project, was killed in a similar attack.\n\nIn 2020, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a UN-sanctioned Iranian nuclear scientist long suspected by the West of masterminding an alleged secret atomic weapons programme was also killed when assassins fired on his vehicle.\n\nFakhrizadeh had featured in a presentation by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, in 2018 in which he accused Iran of continuing to seek nuclear weapons. Fakhrizadeh had been sanctioned by the United Nations in 2007 and the US in 2008.\n\nIn the aftermath of his death, Sheikh Naim Qassem, deputy leader of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, blamed the \"heinous attack\" on \"those sponsored by America and Israel\" and said the response was in Iran's hands.\n\nAt the time, Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, but a senior US administration official told CNN that Israel was behind the assassination, while declining to give details about whether the then Trump administration knew about the attack before it was carried out.\n\nMembers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps have also been victims of targeted killings that have been blamed on Israel.\n\nColonel Hassan Sayyad Khodaei was one such case, although Israel dismissed claims it was involved after he was shot five times outside his home in 2022.\n\nThe Mossad has also reportedly conducted raids of secure facilities, including the theft of secret files on Iran's nuclear weapons programme in April 2018, and is believed to have launched explosive-laden drones at military facilities and infrastructure.\n\nIn May 2022, a suicide drone hit the Parchin military complex, southeast of Tehran, killing an engineer.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the New York Times noted that the \"attack fit a pattern of past Israeli strikes on Iran and Lebanon in a covert campaign of hostility that has been going on for years\".", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors":

While its recognition is extraordinary, including a Nobel Peace Prize awarded to its organizing body, the International Coalition to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), the situation feels like a movie script that may not have a feel-good ending. While advocates of the treaty argue that it bolsters non-proliferation and disarmament, some nuclear weapons states (NWS) are retreating further and further from existing arms control protocols and agreements, such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).\n\nAlthough it is unlikely that NWS will join the TPNW, there is also the alarming failure of some of these states to engage in meaningful arms control measures to avoid exacerbating an already-volatile security environment. For example, China has recently reiterated its refusal to engage in arms control talks after suspending them in protest of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. Additionally, Russian leaders have decided not to engage in the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which is set to expire in two years. So, can anything be done to rewrite this script? Can states with strong non-proliferation credentials, who also rely on NWS for extended nuclear deterrence, play a role in strengthening the nuclear regime if arms control talks fail to resume?\n\nAustralia holds a strong position in the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, which includes monitoring and regulating the military and civilian use of nuclear material. Australia's past and present commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation regime should be held in high regard. Of course, this has come under scrutiny in the wake of AUKUS. However, to address concerns over the proliferation risk associated with acquiring nuclear-powered submarines, Australia is negotiating a comprehensive safeguards regime with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) alongside its AUKUS partners.\n\nIn fact, Australia has long used its position in the nuclear regime to ensure that member states and signatories to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) adhere to strict nuclear safeguards and promote nuclear disarmament. There is no evidence to suggest that Australia is pivoting from this position. However, in the wake of waning arms control negotiations, Russia and China's rejection of the United Nations Security Council Resolution on a weapons-free outer space and Russia's nuclear threats, Australia can be proactive in promoting stability and security in three keys ways:\n\nStrengthening diplomatic efforts through multilateral diplomacy and bilateral relationships. Actively engaging in international forums to advocate for the resumption of talks, while using bilateral channels, can encourage dialogue between major powers. Australia has also shown that small groups of countries, including some under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, can make progress though initiatives that complement the NPT. This includes the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) that Australia co-chairs with Japan, which South Korea should consider joining.\n\nPersisting with support for existing norms and treaties, with an emphasis on reinforcing Australia's continued commitment to upholding the principles of non-proliferation and maintaining support for the NPT (which has strong verification and enforcement mechanisms; the TPNW has none) and Nuclear Weapons Free Zones (NWFZ). Indeed, Australia's position as a uranium supplier -- currently fourth globally -- comes with strict guidelines requiring recipients of its uranium to be covered by IAEA safeguards, including the Additional Protocol. No third party can gain access to Australian uranium without Australia's prior consent, and nuclear-weapon states cannot use Australian obligated nuclear material (AONM) for anything other than peaceful purposes.\n\nStrengthening non-proliferation by supporting U.S. extended deterrence. Australia, South Korea, Japan and the NATO allies can be more vocal about the stabilizing function of the U.S. nuclear umbrella, both to dissuade proliferation and deter aggression. This cannot only be achieved behind closed doors among U.S. allies through formats like the Australian-U.S. Strategic Policy Dialogue and evolving of mini-laterals. It should also be part of the messaging around regional diplomatic and military engagements, like the biennial Talisman Sabre military exercise held in 2023 with 13 other nations. This would hopefully build confidence and understanding among regional partners who are not U.S. treaty allies, perhaps encouraging broader talks about the stabilizing function of U.S. power projection. Candid communication about the positive nexus between U.S. extended deterrence and non-proliferation is essential to rebut Moscow and Beijing's self-serving claims that the two are opposed.\n\nSo, while the distance between all critical nations joining the TPNW seems to be growing, and stalled arms control negotiations herald a time for deep reflection on the state of our regional and global security environment, there is still much non-nuclear weapons states like Australia can achieve. Holding strong to our commitment to a world without nuclear proliferation will hopefully mean that this current script can be rewritten.\n\nDr. Cathy Moloney is the deputy director of Defence Strategy & National Security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).

It has issued a petition aimed at Coalition MPs and federal Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.\n\nThe petition states: \"There has been no consultation or free prior and informed consent from Traditional Owners.\n\n\"You never asked locals if they want nuclear reactors in their back yards. Instead, you threaten compulsory acquisition and federal overrides with no right to veto.\n\n\"We want secure jobs and affordable, proven renewable energy now -- not half-baked nuclear plans for 2040 or beyond.\"\n\nLaunched by Dutton on June 19, the civil nuclear scheme will go on record as one of the most astoundingly inept policy initiatives ever ventured by a major political party.\n\nNo attempt has been even made to give an approximate costing for its proposal, with Dutton saying such details will be provided \"in due course\".\n\nNo thought seems to have been given to the question of how nuclear might fit within the country's energy system, now increasingly based on renewables.\n\nThe vexed question of nuclear safety has been ignored as, substantially, has that of radioactive waste disposal. Then there are the impacts on greenhouse emissions.\n\nNuclear power is notorious for its lengthy construction times, with targets routinely missed by many years. In the meantime, coal plants and gas-fired installations would be kept running.\n\nDutton has repeatedly claimed, most recently on ABC Radio, that \"nuclear provides cheap electricity\". A mountain of international evidence says otherwise. The nukes -- if they eventuate -- will be an economic atrocity.\n\nThe CSIRO's most recent GenCost report puts the \"levelised cost\" in 2030 of solar and wind plus storage at $91 to $130 per megawatt-hour.\n\nThe report estimates the corresponding cost of electricity from a large-scale nuclear reactor at between $141 and $233 per megawatt-hour -- comparing the mid-points in the estimates, a likely 70% more.\n\nIn Trump-like fashion, Dutton has dismissed the CSIRO's report as \"discredited\".\n\nBut contracts signed recently for new nukes in Czechia suggest the real price would be much higher still. Not only that, prices for renewable electricity in Australia keep dropping fast.\n\nMeanwhile, residents and local authorities near the proposed reactor sites have had the Coalition's scheme dumped on them, with no consultation.\n\nThe Port Augusta City Council, the designated site for the South Australian nukes, said on June 20: \"The Council has not been formally contacted regarding the nuclear power plant proposal and has not received any information.\"\n\nIndeed, Dutton and his shadow energy minister Ted O'Brien seem not to have performed even elementary checks before announcing the proposed locations of the plants.\n\nIn the case of the Port Augusta, it promises a planning shambles -- and that may well the same in other states.\n\nDutton and O'Brien assumed that where coal-fired plants had been shut down, or would close in coming years, nuclear plants could simply be plugged in.\n\nThis is not necessarily so. Near Port Augusta, SA's last coal-fired plant shut down in 2016. But time has not stood still and on the now privately-owned power station site, work is set to begin on a $125-million green cement plant. An export port is also planned.\n\nThe transmission lines linking Port Augusta to the wider grid remain -- but they are not unused. Since 2016, the Upper Spencer Gulf region around Port Augusta has emerged as a thriving hub of renewable energy generation, with massive wind and solar PV farms.\n\nAs a result, there is almost no spare capacity on the transmission lines that link the region to the broader energy market. To accommodate a Port Augusta nuclear plant, hundreds of kilometres of new high-tension lines would have to be built.\n\nAbundant locally-produced renewable energy is drawing large new industries to the Upper Spencer Gulf region. Projects that have been mooted and, in some cases, begun include renewable hydrogen, metals processing including green steel and water desalination.\n\nBut the energy has to be cheap -- and nuclear power is not in the race.\n\nIn general, nuclear power provides an absurdly poor fit with SA's energy grid, known for its world-leading use of renewables.\n\nFor extended periods each summer, wind and solar provide 100% of the state's energy needs, reliably and at exceptionally low wholesale cost. By 2027, the system is to be 100% net-renewable.\n\nSo where is the room for nuclear? That is the story in just one state.\n\nAround the country, there will be many more pitfalls waiting for a hubristic politician who thinks himself entitled to spout policy based on make believe.\n\nSome of Dutton's \"facts\" are truly comedic -- in a very dark kind of way.\n\nOn June 19 he declared: \"If you look at a 470-megawatt reactor, it produces waste equivalent to the size of a can of Coke every year\". The scientific consensus is: many tonnes.\n\nLethally dangerous, the waste would need to be kept isolated for tens of thousands of years, at monumental expense.\n\nThe way Dutton has drawn up and pushed his scheme -- distracted, and without regard for normal process -- has convinced various commentators that his whole quest is just a ploy for handing billions of dollars in continuing business to fossil-fuel mates.\n\nThere is something to be said for this view: The Coalition's endorsement of nuclear can only have a deadening effect on investment in renewables.\n\nUntil the nuclear plants begin turning out electricity -- sometime in the 2040s according to most analysts -- the coal and especially fossil gas corporations will be able to carry on digging, drilling, polluting and profiting.\n\nNone of the above, however, proves that Dutton and his front-benchers are not fervent believers in nuclear power.\n\nIndeed, their faith seems to have remained undimmed even while the absurdities of their scheme shred their claim to be superior economic managers.\n\nBelief in nuclear power, just like hatred of \"greenies\", is an ideological fixation of many conservatives.\n\nIt would be very foolish to suppose that, in power, the Coalition would not set about doing exactly as it has promised.\n\nFor this reason, broad-based campaigning against Dutton's plans is essential.\n\n[Renfrey Clarke is a long-time anti-nuclear campaigner and a member of Socialist Alliance.]", "source": {"uri": "greenleft.org.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Green Left"}, "authors":

Why don't we hear anything on the subject from the politicians? The silence is deafening.\n\nJacobsen's book proves the utter insanity of genocidal nuclear weapons as the only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons. She dramatizes the total breakdown of \"logical\" decision-making as the fog of war thickens in the midst of the ridiculously short time-frame constraining officials as they try vainly to prevent the end of the world. And she is stomach-churningly specific about the varieties of gory violence visited upon millions of human bodies by nuclear war.\n\nIt becomes clear is that no human being possesses the capacity to think their way calmly through excruciating choices as information pours in from billion-dollar communications systems whose only utility, once Armageddon begins, is to count the minutes remaining for the president to be helicoptered out of Dodge before he is vaporized.\n\nThe fact that there is no way to fight and win as such events unfold leaves only the military's weird assumption that the hair-trigger systems of the nine nuclear nations will deter war forever without any error. As so many authors, including Jacobsen, have documented, the list of near-misses that have already happened is far too long, including a Russian early-warning system mistaking the moon for a squadron of incoming missiles.\n\nYet the beat goes seamlessly on. Trillions of our tax dollars, Chinese yen, and Russian rubles needed for the conversion to sustainable sources of energy continue to be poured down the rathole of nuclear \"upgrading.\"\n\nThe Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) has worked to ensure that nuclear weapons have become illegal under international law. Where is any discussion of this in the mainstream media? We are passive victims of what Noam Chomsky called \"manufactured consent.\"\n\nReportedly Jacobsen's book will be made into a film by the director of the Dune films, Denis Villeneuve. This project could not be more timely when we recall the moment Reagan watched the relatively tame TV film \"The Day After\" and was inspired to change his attitude toward the evil Russian empire, allowing him to make real progress on disarmament with his visionary counterpart in Russia, Mikhail Gorbachev. The two leaders openly considered the mutual standing down of all their nuclear weapons -- before alarmed aides jumped in to restore the \"sanity\" of the status quo. While Putin is no Gorbachev, he surely doesn't want to risk incineration.\n\nEven leaders of autocratic nations are vulnerable to pressure from informed and aroused populations. The United States, possessor of both the most deadly and advanced weapons systems and a long tradition of free speech, can help accelerate a worldwide debate.\n\n\"Nuclear War: A Scenario\" gives average citizens the tools to begin conversations and ask effective questions. One doesn't need to be an expert. The book shows that once nuclear war starts, the \"experts\" possess neither more expertise nor moral clarity than you or me. Someone should ask:\n\n*\"Candidate X, have you rehearsed scenarios of incipient nuclear war and the choices you have to make? Do you think you could maintain your cool once you are told that missiles are incoming, or have you realized that a deterrence breakdown would put you or any leader in an impossible position?\"\n\n*\"Obama considered eliminating such protocols as launch-on-warning and no-first-use, but they remain official U.S. policy. Given the opportunity, would you try to change such policies?\"\n\n*\"If responding vengefully to an attack with massive retaliation would make planet-killing nuclear winter a certainty, wouldn't it make sense not to retaliate at all?\"\n\n*\"Are there unilateral initiatives that the U.S. could take, including ex-Secretary of Defense Perry's suggestion that we stand down our entire land-based missile fleet, that would enhance rather than threaten our security?\"\n\n*\"The vast majority of the world's citizens would be grateful if the U.S. signed the U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Why not sign as an initial commitment to our long-term intention to help move the world beyond mass suicide?\"", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"},

The former longtime Boston shortstop won\u2019t be competing against the Red Sox this weekend as he recovers from a shoulder fracture he sustained last month. However, Bogaerts, who played in Boston for the first decade of his MLB career, opted to make the trip with his teammates to his old stomping grounds. The 31-year-old was asked about his decision to leave the Red Sox and sign with the Padres in Dec. 2022 for a massive 11-year, $280 million contract while speaking with reporters ahead of Friday\u2019s game. \u201cI\u2019m happy and I feel like they\u2019re happy also,\u201d Bogaerts said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the decision I made, to be honest. San Diego is one of the best cities that you can have.\u201d He also said that there\u2019s no love lost between him and the Red Sox following his decision to sign elsewhere two offseasons ago. \u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of them. Players, coaches, front office was always really nice to me and my family and I really don\u2019t have no hard feelings at all toward them,\u201d he said. During batting practice on Friday, Bogaerts reunited with manager Alex Cora and president Sam Kennedy. Bogaerts also chatted with current Red Sox shortstop/center fielder Ceddanne Rafaela before the game. Bogaerts and Rafaela both hail from islands of the Kingdom of the Netherlands \u2014 Aruba and Cura\u00e7ao, respectively. Bogaerts explained that he and Rafaela communicate with one another, and were texting the other day. Bogaerts praised the 23-year-old and his impressive start to the year. \u201cHe\u2019s got it, man. It\u2019s elite in short and center. It\u2019s not something that a lot of guys can say that they can do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he hits, I think with him it\u2019s patience. The more he learns the strike zone, the more he plays, the more better he\u2019ll get, that\u2019s for sure. He works hard and has a lot of talent, that\u2019s for sure. He has a good mindset.\u201d Bogaerts joined the Red Sox organization as an international free agent, similar to Rafaela, in 2009 at just 16 years old. He was called up to the majors in 2013 and made his mark as one of the faces of the team over the next decade. Bogaerts didn\u2019t think fans would recognize him while walking around Boston on Thursday despite his lengthy Red Sox tenure. He said they proved him wrong. \u201cI was walking around yesterday and it was crazy,\u201d Bogaerts said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, I wasn\u2019t expecting so many people to remember me. That was actually a little cool.\u201d Boston fans gave their 2018 World Series champion shortstop a warm standing ovation as the Red Sox showed a tribute video of Bogaerts during Friday\u2019s game.

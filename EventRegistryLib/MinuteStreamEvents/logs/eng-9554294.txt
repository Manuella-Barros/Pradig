(AP [...]\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Hunter Biden's federal gun case should move forward, an appeals court ruled Thursday, setting the stage for the president's son to stand trial on criminal charges next month in Delaware.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyers went to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the judge overseeing the case last month rejected his bid to dismiss the prosecution. A three-judge panel of the appeals court did not rule on the merits of his claims, but said the court doesn't have jurisdiction to review the matter.\n\nIn an order shortly after that ruling came down, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said the case would proceed to trial on June 3, and is expected to last three to six days. Noreika, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, later denied another bid to dismiss the case that challenged the constitutionality of the central gun charge.\n\nThe rulings pave the way for the Justice Department to bring President Joe Biden's son to trial in the midst of the president's re-election campaign. Hunter Biden is separately charged in a tax case in California that is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late June.\n\nHis legal team, however, suggested they will continue fighting the issue, which they can ask the full appeals court to consider.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in an emailed statement.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware. He has acknowledged an addiction to crack cocaine during that period, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law.\n\nThe yearslong investigation had looked ready to wrap up with a plea deal last year, but the agreement imploded after a judge raised questions about it. Biden was subsequently indicted.\n\nUnder the deal, he would have gotten two years' probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. He also would have avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble.\n\nHis attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict him amid heavy criticism of the plea deal from Trump and other Republicans. They had also challenged the appointment of Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel to lead the prosecution.\n\nProsecutors countered the evidence against him was \"overwhelming,\" including cocaine residue found in the pouch where he stored his gun, and noted that charges had been filed during the presidency of his father.\n\nIn her ruling last month, Noreika said that the defense had provided \"nothing credible\" to suggest that the lawmakers or anyone else had any impact on the special counsel, adding: \"It is all speculation.\"\n\nHe faces separate tax counts in Los Angeles alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over three years while living an \"extravagant lifestyle,\" during his days of using drugs. He is separately challenging rulings rejecting his motions to dismiss those charges.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Shortly after the appeals court ruled, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika ordered the trial of up to six days to begin June 3 in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" said a statement by Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Hunter Biden. The statement did not specify if Hunter Biden would request that the entire appeals court in Philadelphia review the panel's decision.\n\nHunter Biden was appealing orders issued last month by Noreika. The judge denied motions to dismiss two counts accusing Hunter Biden of lying about using illegal narcotics when he purchased a Colt Cobra handgun in 2018 and a third count of illegally possessing that weapon. Hunter Biden's legal team had argued that the lower trial court had to wait for the federal appeals court to rule before it could push ahead with a trial.\n\nHunter Biden faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison on the gun charges. The trial will come as Joe Biden is ramping up his campaign for reelection.\n\nThe Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, is currently on criminal trial in New York, where he is accused of illegally covering up a $130,000 payment to a porn star to keep her quiet in the run-up to the 2016 election. Hunter Biden is also facing criminal tax charges in California.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_56_48_7796591.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554294", "eventUri": "eng-9554294", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 128, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

But the judges ruled his case didn't meet that standard.\n\nTrial is scheduled the week of June 3.\n\nThe indictment charges Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. He is charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged he was a drug addict at the time.\n\nHe faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted - five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm - but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe plea agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied. The deal might have allowed him to avoid prison.\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, investigated Hunter Biden for five years and reached a plea agreement last July. But Republican lawmakers criticized the agreement, which could have carried no jail time, as a \"sweetheart deal.\"\n\nNoreika rejected the plea agreement because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether Hunter Biden could face other charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland then appointed Weiss as special counsel to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments in Delaware on gun charges and in California on tax charges. Biden has also appealed to dismiss the tax charges.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_possession_of_a_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Criminal possession of a weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryellen_Noreika", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryellen Noreika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbe_Lowell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abbe Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory_and_Legal", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Regulatory and Legal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EdPzs_0iuEdPXs0luUCNOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MjM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/2602d121c0d8c0dd937bff344b62c718", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554294", "eventUri": "eng-9554294", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1539, "textEnd": 1545}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-12", "textStart": 1661, "textEnd": 1674}], "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

A three-judge panel of the appeals court did not rule on the merits of his claims, but said the court doesn't have jurisdiction to review the matter.\n\nIn an order shortly after that ruling came down, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika said the case would proceed to trial on June 3, and is expected to last three to six days. Noreika, who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, later denied another bid to dismiss the case that challenged the constitutionality of the central gun charge.\n\nThe rulings pave the way for the Justice Department to bring President Joe Biden's son to trial in the midst of the president's re-election campaign. Hunter Biden is separately charged in a tax case in California that is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late June.\n\nHis legal team, however, suggested they will continue fighting the issue, which they can ask the full appeals court to consider.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" defense lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in an emailed statement.\n\nHunter Biden has pleaded not guilty to lying about his drug use in October 2018 on a form to buy a gun that he kept for about 11 days in Delaware.

Biden was subsequently indicted.\n\nUnder the deal, he would have gotten two years' probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. He also would have avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble.\n\nHis attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict him amid heavy criticism of the plea deal from Trump and other Republicans. They had also challenged the appointment of Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel to lead the prosecution.\n\nProsecutors countered the evidence against him was \"overwhelming,\" including cocaine residue found in the pouch where he stored his gun, and noted that charges had been filed during the presidency of his father.\n\nIn her ruling last month, Noreika said that the defense had provided \"nothing credible\" to suggest that the lawmakers or anyone else had any impact on the special counsel, adding: \"It is all speculation.\"\n\nHe faces separate tax counts in Los Angeles alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over three years while living an \"extravagant lifestyle,\" during his days of using drugs.

But the appellate panel instead rejected Biden's appeal, handing yet another victory to special counsel David Weiss, who brought the charges.\n\nWeiss' team successfully argued that the appellate court didn't have jurisdiction to review the matter and therefore was required by law to dismiss Biden's appeal.\n\n\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling.\n\nThe trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. There is still one additional motion to dismiss the case -- it pertains to Biden's rights under the Second Amendment -- that the trial judge hasn't decided yet.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal.\n\nProsecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts.\n\nHis attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that \"possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.\"\n\nUS District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden's botched plea deal hearing last summer.\n\nIn rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors \"do not implicate a right not to be tried\" and wouldn't give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals.\n\nThe decision was unanimous and based on procedural grounds. The three-judge panel included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, including Judge Cindy Chung, who was put on the bench by President Joe Biden.\n\nHunter Biden is also facing a federal tax indictment, and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Biden is the son of President Joe Biden.\n\nIn its ruling Thursday, a three-judge panel on the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said Hunter Biden failed to show that the trial judge's rulings in April allowing the gun case to proceed were appealable before any final judgment, which could include his sentencing.\n\nThe appeals panel, whose decision was unanimous, did not rule on the merits of Biden's arguments that the indictment should be dismissed.\n\nIf Biden is convicted at trial, he could renew the arguments for dismissal with the same appeals court that it declined to consider in its order Thursday.\n\nHunter Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, suggested that he will ask a full panel of judges on the 3rd Circuit to reconsider Biden's appeal, and could even ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the case.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Lowell said.\n\nBiden is charged with three criminal counts related to his purchase of a handgun while he was addicted to illegal drugs. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn late 2023, Biden's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika to dismiss the indictment against him on three separate grounds.\n\nThe first was that the indictment violated a non-prosecution provision in a pre-trial diversion agreement that Biden and prosecutors signed before a planned deal in the case to avoid an indictment blew up last year.\n\nIn their second motion to dismiss, Biden's lawyers claimed he was vindictively and selectively prosecuted because his father is the president. Under this line of argument, the indictment violates the separation-of-power provision in the U.S. Constitution because it was improperly motivated by Republicans in Congress who have made him a political whipping boy to attack the president.\n\nThe third motion to dismiss argued that the appointment of David Weiss as special counsel for the Department of Justice to handle Biden's cases violated federal rules requiring special counsels to be selected from outside the U.S. government.

But the appellate panel instead rejected Biden's appeal, handing yet another victory to special counsel David Weiss, who brought the charges.Weiss' team successfully argued that the appellate court didn't have jurisdiction to review the matter and therefore was required by law to dismiss Biden's appeal.\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling.The trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. There is still one additional motion to dismiss the case -- it pertains to Biden's rights under the Second Amendment -- that the trial judge hasn't decided yet.\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal.Prosecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time.

He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals.\n\nA federal appeals court refused Thursday to throw out Hunter Biden's federal gun indictment, teeing up a high-stakes criminal trial next month in Delaware.\n\nThe president's son had asked the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the charges by overturning prior decisions from the trial judge that the case should move forward. But the appellate panel instead rejected Biden's appeal, handing yet another victory to special counsel David Weiss, who brought the charges.\n\nWeiss' team successfully argued that the appellate court didn't have jurisdiction to review the matter and therefore was required by law to dismiss Biden's appeal.\n\n\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling.\n\nThe trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. There is still one additional motion to dismiss the case -- it pertains to Biden's rights under the Second Amendment -- that the trial judge hasn't decided yet.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal.\n\nProsecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts.\n\nHis attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that \"possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month.

The ruling allows for a trial against Hunter Biden to move forward but also leaves open the possibility for another appeal if he's convicted.\n\nThe decision from Judges Patty Shwartz, Cindy Chung and D. Brooks Smith was unanimous and on procedural grounds.\n\nThe president's son had argued that the charges brought against him are \"unprecedented\" and \"unconstitutional\" and violated a diversion agreement reached with federal prosecutors that collapsed in July after a judge refused to sign off on it. Hunter Biden was indicted in September and faces three felony counts stemming from his purchase of a Colt Cobra 388PL revolver in 2018, while he was a drug user.\n\nProsecutors alleged that he unlawfully possessed the firearm for 11 days and made false statements on a form used for gun purchases claiming he was not an unlawful drug user. President Biden's son has pleaded not guilty to the gun charges, which were filed in Delaware. He was also indicted in California in December on nine federal tax charges. Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to those charges and is pursuing a similar effort to dismiss the indictment there.\n\nIn court filings seeking to dismiss the gun charges, Hunter Biden's lawyers claimed the diversion agreement, which required him to refrain from using drugs and alcohol and barred the purchase and possession of firearms, as well as other conditions, remains legally binding and valid.

But the judges ruled his case didn't meet that standard.\n\nThe indictment charges Biden with knowingly deceiving a firearms dealer by buying a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver on Oct. 12, 2018. He is charged with falsely filling out a federal form denying he was addicted to any narcotics. And he is charged with knowingly possessing the revolver despite the restrictions against people addicted to drugs owning firearms.\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged he was a drug addict at the time.\n\nHe faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted - five years for the false statement to the dealer, 10 years for the false statement on the federal form and 10 years for possession of the firearm - but actual sentences typically are shorter than the maximum, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe plea agreement would have allowed Biden to plead guilty to two misdemeanors for failing to pay his taxes in 2017 and 2018, and to enter a pretrial program for a gun charge that could have been dismissed if he complied. The deal might have allowed him to avoid prison.\n\nDavid Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, investigated Hunter Biden for five years and reached a plea agreement last July. But Republican lawmakers criticized the agreement, which could have carried no jail time, as a \"sweetheart deal.\"\n\nNoreika rejected the plea agreement because of disputes between prosecutors and defense lawyers about whether Hunter Biden could face other charges.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland then appointed Weiss as special counsel to continue his investigation. Weiss secured indictments in Delaware on gun charges and in California on tax charges.

But the appellate panel instead rejected Biden's appeal, handing yet another victory to special counsel David Weiss, who brought the charges.\n\nWeiss' team successfully argued that the appellate court didn't have jurisdiction to review the matter and therefore was required by law to dismiss Biden's appeal.\n\n\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling.\n\nThe trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. There is still one additional motion to dismiss the case -- it pertains to Biden's rights under the Second Amendment -- that the trial judge hasn't decided yet.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Biden's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal.\n\nProsecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which violated federal law because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts.\n\nHis attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that\"possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.\"\n\nUS District Judge Maryellen Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden's botched plea deal hearing last summer.\n\nIn rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors \"do not implicate a right not to be tried\" and wouldn't give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals.\n\nBiden is also facing a federal tax indictment, and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN's Holmes Lybrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

For Dailymail.Com\n\nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals refused to throw out a federal gun case against Hunter Biden, rejecting the president's son's claim that he is being prosecuted for political purposes.\n\nThe decision clears the way for Hunter to face a jury trial in the case on June 3 in Delaware, during his father's re-election campaign.\n\nThe president's son, 54, has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges related to him lying about his drug use when purchasing a gun in 2018.\n\nHe faces up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted after the trial that could last up to nine days.\n\nHis efforts to scuttle the other criminal case he faces in California involving tax allegations have also failed.\n\nHunter's lawyers have argued the case was politically motivated and asserted that an immunity provision from an original plea deal that fell apart still holds.\n\nHunter Biden attends the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 1, 2024\n\nBiden became the first child of a sitting president to be indicted. He faces more than 20 years in prison if convicted on the gun charges\n\nThey had also challenged the appointment of Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel to lead the prosecution.\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law.\n\nThe investigation had looked ready to wrap up with a plea deal last year, but the agreement imploded after a judge raised questions about it.\n\nUnder the deal, he would have gotten a plea deal in which he would have gotten two years\u00b4 probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges.\n\nHe also would have avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble. He was subsequently indicted.\n\nBiden's attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the him amid heavy criticism of the plea deal from Trump and other Republicans.\n\nProsecutors countered the evidence against him was 'overwhelming,' including cocaine residue found in the pouch where he stored his gun.\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law\n\nThe above form shows Hunter Biden checked 'no' when asked if he is 'an unlawful user of, or addicted to' a controlled substance. But the president's son detailed in his own book that he relapsed in 2018 - the same year he purchased the firearm\n\nA picture from Hunter Biden's laptop showed the now 53-year-old first son posing nude with a firearm\n\nNorieka said in her ruling that Biden's team provided 'nothing concrete' to support a conclusion that anyone actually influenced the special counsel's team.\n\nThe judge wrote: 'The pressure campaign from Congressional Republicans may have occurred around the time that Special Counsel decided to move forward with indictment instead of pretrial diversion, but the Court has been given nothing credible to suggest that the conduct of those lawmakers (or anyone else) had any impact on Special Counsel. It is all speculation.'\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss brought the gun charges in September, when Biden became the first child of a sitting president to be indicted. He faces more than 20 years in prison if convicted on the gun charges.\n\nBiden's attorneys argued the gun charges should be dismissed for a variety of reasons including that the law under which he was charged was likely unconstitutional after the U.S. Supreme Court expanded gun rights in a 2022 ruling.\n\nHis legal team also had argued that Weiss was not appropriately appointed, that Biden was being selectively prosecuted and that he had a binding agreement that shielded him from prosecution.\n\nBiden also has pleaded not guilty to federal tax crimes in a separate case brought by Weiss in California, facing up to 17 years in prison if convicted. That trial is scheduled to start on June 20.\n\nThe special counsel accused Biden of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions of dollars on drugs, escorts, exotic cars and other high-ticket items.\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles on April 1 rejected Biden's motions to dismiss the tax indictment.\n\nThe Justice Department says Hunter faces up to 17 years in prison for the tax charges.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a statement released on Thursday, the Court stated that \"the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment.\"\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit refused to throw out Hunter Biden's indictment on federal gun charges in a court document released Thursday.\n\nThe president's son is set to stand trial next month in Delaware.\n\n\"The defendant in this criminal case appealed three pretrial orders entered on April 12, 2024, denying his motions to dismiss the indictment,\" the court document released Thursday states. \"This appeal is DISMISSED because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment.\"\n\nBiden's lawyers filed the motion in federal court earlier this year, arguing that a diversion agreement previously agreed to by the Department of Justice, and Biden's legal team should remain in effect.\n\nLast month, here at RedState, Susie Moore reported on the failed dismissal attempt before District Court Judge Maryellen Norieka on the part of Hunter Biden's legal team. Biden's attorneys appealed Noreika's ruling to the Third Circuit, which has now dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and denied Biden's alternative request for a writ of mandamus.\n\nPreviously on RedState: Bad News for Hunter Biden As Judge Denies Motions to Dismiss Delaware Gun Case\n\nHunter Biden will now face trial on federal gun charges in June.\n\nThe case originated with Hunter Biden's purchase of a revolver in 2018 while being an active drug user. For all firearms purchases carried out through a licensed dealer, federal law requires completion of Form 4473, which includes a list of questions that must be answered before the background check and eventual transfer of the firearm. One of those questions is:\n\nAre you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?\n\nWarning: The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or\n\ndecriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.\n\nHunter Biden allegedly answered this question in the negative, lying on the form, and therefore, the purchase violated federal law.\n\nThis case isn't the only legal issue facing Hunter Biden. He also faces federal tax charges in a California case.\n\nA three to six day jury trial is set to begin on June 3 and will be presided over by Judge Maryellen Noreika. A pre-trial conference is scheduled for May 24.\n\nBiden is also expected to stand trial on June 20 in Los Angeles for federal tax charges brought against him in the same investigation headed by Special Counsel David Weiss.\n\nThe First Son, with all of his widely publicized drug use, his impregnating of a stripper, and his suspicious Ukrainian and Chinese business dealings -- not to mention his career as an \"artist\" which involves selling what can only be described as daubs for astronomical sums -- has been an ongoing liability for the Biden administration.\n\nSee Related: WATCH: Afroman Reprises 'Then I Got High' Hit to Hilariously Mock Hunter Biden, Family Influence Peddling\n\nThis case presents an interesting example of the law biting the hand that fed it; Hunter's father, President Joe Biden, has never seen a gun-control law he wasn't in favor of, and now his son faces trial for the illegal purchase of a firearm by lying on the Form 4473 that is required for all gun purchases. The schadenfreude is strong with this one.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type":

According to his lawyers, he owned the gun for just 11 days and never fired it.\n\nA three-judge panel of the court rejected Biden's appeal because they decided that before a final judgment in the case Biden could not appeal.\n\n\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the decision said.\n\nUnless a new plea agreement is reached, Hunter Biden's trial is set to begin in June.\n\nIn a statement, Biden attorney Abbe Lowell said, \"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate.\"\n\nThat's an indication Lowell may ask the full Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia to hear the appeal.\n\nIn April, Biden lost an appeal before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Norieka, in which he had argued his prosecution was selective and vindictive.\n\nA Thursday order by Norieka set a June 3 trial date and Biden is scheduled to appear for a pretrial conference in court May 24.\n\nAccording to the appeals court filing Thursday, Biden's appeal before that court argued the indictment violated a non-prosecution provision in a \"diversion agreement\" he and the government had previously signed.\n\nBiden also argued in his appeal that he was vindictively and selectively prosecuted and the indictment violated separation of powers principles because \"it was improperly motivated by the Legislative Branch and political pressure.\"\n\nBiden's third motion to dismiss, according to the appeals court filing, said the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's appointment as a special counsel violated a legal requirement that special counsel be \"selected from outside the United States Government\" and the Special Counsel \"improperly used an appropriation established by Congress for \"independent\" counsel without the requisite independence.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weissindicted Biden in September 2023 for allegedly making false statements to a firearms dealer when he knew he was \"an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant, narcotic, drug and any other controlled substance\" while possessing the gun.\n\nThat's a felony.

For Dailymail.Com\n\nThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals refused to throw out a federal gun case against Hunter Biden, rejecting the president's son's claim that he is being prosecuted for political purposes. The decision clears the way for Hunter to face a jury trial in the case on June 3 in Delaware, during his father's re-election campaign.\n\nThe president's son, 54, has pleaded not guilty to three felony charges related to him lying about his drug use when purchasing a gun in 2018. He faces up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted after the trial that could last up to nine days. His efforts to scuttle the other criminal case he faces in California involving tax allegations have also failed.\n\nHunter's lawyers have argued the case was politically motivated and asserted that an immunity provision from an original plea deal that fell apart still holds. They had also challenged the appointment of Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss as special counsel to lead the prosecution. Last month, District Judge Maryellen Noreika also r ejected Hunter's attempt to throw out the case.\n\nThe president's son has acknowledged struggling with an addiction to crack cocaine during that period in 2018, but his lawyers have said he didn't break the law. The investigation had looked ready to wrap up with a plea deal last year, but the agreement imploded after a judge raised questions about it.\n\nUnder the deal, he would have gotten a plea deal in which he would have gotten two years\u00b4 probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. He also would have avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of trouble. He was subsequently indicted.\n\nBiden's attorneys have argued that prosecutors bowed to political pressure to indict the him amid heavy criticism of the plea deal from Trump and other Republicans. Prosecutors countered the evidence against him was 'overwhelming,' including cocaine residue found in the pouch where he stored his gun.\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss brought the gun charges in September, when Biden became the first child of a sitting president to be indicted. He faces more than 20 years in prison if convicted on the gun charges. Biden's attorneys argued the gun charges should be dismissed for a variety of reasons including that the law under which he was charged was likely unconstitutional after the U.S. Supreme Court expanded gun rights in a 2022 ruling.\n\nHis legal team also had argued that Weiss was not appropriately appointed, that Biden was being selectively prosecuted and that he had a binding agreement that shielded him from prosecution. Biden also has pleaded not guilty to federal tax crimes in a separate case brought by Weiss in California , facing up to 17 years in prison if convicted. That trial is scheduled to start on June 20.\n\nThe special counsel accused Biden of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes between 2016 and 2019 while spending millions of dollars on drugs, exotic cars and other high-ticket items . U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles on April 1 rejected Biden's motions to dismiss the tax indictment. The Justice Department says Hunter faces up to 17 years in prison for the tax charges.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

According to his lawyers, he owned the gun for just 11 days and never fired it.\n\nA three-judge panel of the court rejected Biden's appeal because they decided that before a final judgment in the case Biden could not appeal.\n\n\"This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the decision said.\n\nUnless a new plea agreement is reached, Hunter Biden's trial is set to begin in June.\n\nIn a statement, Biden attorney Abbe Lowell said, \"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate.\"\n\nThat's an indication Lowell may ask the full Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia to hear the appeal.\n\nIn April, Biden lost an appeal before U.S. District Judge Maryellen Norieka, in which he had argued his prosecution was selective and vindictive.\n\nA Thursday order by Norieka set a June 3 trial date and Biden is scheduled to appear for a pretrial conference in court May 24.\n\nAccording to the appeals court filing Thursday, Biden's appeal before that court argued the indictment violated a non-prosecution provision in a \"diversion agreement\" he and the government had previously signed.\n\nBiden also argued in his appeal that he was vindictively and selectively prosecuted and the indictment violated separation of powers principles because \"it was improperly motivated by the Legislative Branch and political pressure.\"\n\nBiden's third motion to dismiss, according to the appeals court filing, said the prosecuting U.S. Attorney's appointment as a special counsel violated a legal requirement that special counsel be \"selected from outside the United States Government\" and the Special Counsel \"improperly used an appropriation established by Congress for \"independent\" counsel without the requisite independence.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel David Weiss indicted Biden in September 2023 for allegedly making false statements to a firearms dealer when he knew he was \"an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant, narcotic, drug and any other controlled substance\" while possessing the gun.", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng":

O'Neill Jr. House Office Building in Washington on Feb. 28, 2024. (Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)\n\nA federal court on May 9 turned down an attempt by President Joe Biden's son to dismiss gun charges filed against him by federal prosecutors, setting him up to go on trial.\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that Hunter Biden had not shown that district court orders he appealed were able to be challenged before the court enters its final decisions on the matter.\n\n\"The defendant's appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction,\" U.S. Circuit Judges Patty Shwartz, Cindy Chung, and David Smith wrote in the ruling.\n\nJudge Schwartz is an appointee of former President Barack Obama. Judge Chung was appointed by President Biden. Judge Smith is an appointee of former President George W. Bush.\n\nShortly after the appeals court decision was handed down, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who is overseeing the case against Mr. Biden, said Mr. Biden's trial is scheduled to start on June 3.\n\nJudge Noreika, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, also scheduled a pretrial conference for May 24 and told the parties to submit proposed jury instructions by May 17.\n\nMr. Biden was charged in October 2023 with falsely stating on a federal form in 2018 that he was not a drug user when he bought a gun in Delaware, even though he has since admitted he was regularly using drugs at the time. Another charge relates to him possessing a revolver while being a drug user.\n\nHe faces decades in prison if convicted.\n\nMr. Biden and his attorneys have argued that the charges violate a diversion agreement reached between Mr. Biden and special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting the case. They also said that Mr. Weiss was unlawfully appointed, that he brought the charges due to political pressure, and that the charges were unconstitutional.\n\nJudge Noreika declined to dismiss the case earlier this year, finding that Mr. Biden's arguments were largely based on speculation or otherwise unfounded.

Hunter has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nIn April, U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika rejected several motions filed by Hunter's lawyers in an effort to throw out the case.\n\nSome of the failed arguments made included attacks on the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Special Counsel David Weiss, a Donald Trump-nominated U.S. attorney who is prosecuting the case, claiming that the Democratic president's son was being subjected to selective prosecution at the behest of Republicans, and claiming that a previous plea deal that fell apart still holds.\n\nJudge Chung, along with Judge Patty Shwartz, who was appointed by Barack Obama and Judge D. Brooks Smith, who was appointed by George W. Bush, wrote in Thursday's ruling that Hunter \"has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment.\"\n\nWith this order, Hunter's trial scheduled for June 3 in Wilmington, Delaware, will continue as planned. June's trial will be the first of its kind as no other child of a sitting president has been put on trial.\n\nHowever, Hunter's lawyer Abbe Lowell has vowed to continue to try to stop this trial from happening.\n\n\"In reviewing the panel's decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,\" Lowell said in a statement.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Lowell via email for further comment.\n\nHunter faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison if found guilty of the gun charges.\n\nHowever, Dave Aronberg, Democratic state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, told Newsweek via email on Thursday: \"There's no way that Hunter Biden will get anywhere near the maximum penalty for this crime. He has no prior rap sheet and is being prosecuted under a statute that is rarely used and questionable in its constitutionality.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the president's son also faces nine tax charges with a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison in a case brought on by the DOJ. Hunter was indicted in California in December 2023 on three felony counts of tax evasion and filing a false return and six misdemeanor counts of failure to return.\n\nHunter's tax charges trial is set to begin on June 20 after U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi denied all eight motions that Hunter's legal team submitted in an effort to dismiss the case.\n\nIn a statement following Scarsi's April ruling, Lowell said: \"We strongly disagree with the Court's decision and will continue to vigorously pursue Mr. Biden's challenges to the abnormal way the Special Counsel [Weiss] handled this investigation and charged this case.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Brooks_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

The two decisions appear to clear the way for his case to head to trial on June 3, though his defense team can still pursue further appeals.\n\nLast year, Biden was charged with illegally buying a gun while using illegal drugs and with lying on a government form about his drug use when he made the purchase -- two separate criminal charges. Special counsel David Weiss alleges that Biden bought a gun in October 2018, a time when he was frequently using crack cocaine. Biden has spoken publicly about his struggles with drug addiction.\n\nFederal law bars people who use illegal drugs from buying guns. Biden's team, however, argued in court that this ban violates the Second Amendment. They pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which constrained the government's power to regulate gun ownership.\n\nJudge Maryellen Noreika, however, was unpersuaded. Norieka, who was appointed by then-President Donald Trump, noted that while the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the drug-user ban to be unconstitutional in one situation -- specifically, as applied to a habitual marijuana user -- that court explicitly emphasized that its decision was quite narrow. And she wrote that the \"vast majority\" of district courts who have reviewed the drug-user ban in the post-Bruen world have upheld it as constitutional.\n\nShe added that Biden can still challenge the constitutionality of the statute as it was applied to him once his trial is complete.\n\nIn a separate ruling also handed down on Thursday, Noreika ruled against a motion Biden had filed seeking documents the Justice Department possesses involving communications between or among Donald Trump, former Attorney General William Barr, and other Trump-era senior department officials regarding the Biden case.\n\nEarlier Thursday, a three-judge panel on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the president's son on a separate group of motions. Biden had sought to have the charges against him dismissed for several other reasons, arguing he was the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution and that a pretrial diversion agreement he and prosecutors both signed last summer bars the government from charging him.\n\nThe federal judges ruled that Biden cannot make those arguments until after his trial is completed.

Gun charges like these are rare, and an appeals court has found the ban on drug users having guns violates the Second Amendment under new Supreme Court standards.\n\nHunter Biden's attorneys are suggesting that prosecutors bowed to pressure by Republicans who have insisted the president's son got a sweetheart deal, and the charges were the result of political pressure.\n\nHe was indicted after the implosion this summer of his plea agreement with federal prosecutors on tax and gun charges. The deal devolved after the judge who was supposed to sign off on the agreement instead raised a series of questions about the deal. Federal prosecutors had been looking into his business dealings for five years and the agreement would have dispensed with criminal proceedings before his father was actively campaigning for president in 2024.\n\nNow, a special counsel has been appointed to handle the case and there appears no easy end in sight. No new tax charges have yet been filed, but the special counsel has indicated they could come in California or Washington.\n\nIn Congress, House Republicans are seeking to link Hunter Biden's dealings to his father's through an impeachment inquiry. Republicans have been investigating Hunter Biden for years, since his father was vice president. While questions have arisen about the ethics surrounding the Biden family's international business, no evidence has emerged so far to prove that Joe Biden, in his current or previous office, abused his role or accepted bribes.\n\nThe legal wrangling could spill into 2024, with Republicans eager to divert attention from the multiple criminal indictments faced by GOP primary frontrunner Donald Trump, whose trials could be unfolding at the same time.\n\nAfter remaining silent for years, Hunter Biden has taken a more aggressive legal stance in recent weeks, filing a series of lawsuits over the dissemination of personal information purportedly from his laptop and his tax data by whistleblower IRS agents who testified before Congress as part of the GOP probe.\n\nThe president's son, who has not held public office, is charged with two counts of making false statements and one count of illegal gun possession, punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Under the failed deal, he would have pleaded guilty and served probation rather than jail time on misdemeanor tax charges and avoided prosecution on a single gun count if he stayed out of trouble for two years.\n\nDefense attorneys have argued that he remains protected by an immunity provision that was part of the scuttled plea agreement, but prosecutors overseen by special counsel David Weiss disagree. Weiss also serves as U.S. Attorney for Delaware and was originally appointed by Trump.\n\nHunter Biden, who lives in California, had asked for Tuesday's hearing to be conducted remotely over video feed but U.S. Magistrate Judge Christopher Burke sided with prosecutors, saying there would be no \"special treatment.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Prosecutors could not point to a single case in which they had agreed to such a generous \"diversion agreement\" for felony gun charges for anyone else, and a probation officer declined to approve the deal.\n\nA lawyer for rapper Kodak Black, who received three years in prison for similar charges, said, \"There's no such thing as not getting jail time on a gun charge... 2 tiers of justice?\"\n\nNonetheless, Hunter argued to the court that he is the victim of \"selective and vindictive prosecution,\" and continued to demand documents to prove it even after the judge shut down the argument. He went so far as to demand information about grand jurors, which is normally secret, because \"it remains possible that in this highly-politicized matter, the grand jury was selected without regard to the bias that people might have.\"\n\nThe DOJ under Hunter's father, President Joe Biden, has charged 1,200 January 6 defendants, sometimes for conduct as petty as trespassing, in D.C., which voted 93% for Biden, and secured a nearly 100% conviction rate.\n\nHunter's lawyers also sought to use the court case to compel the production of documents relating to former officials in the Trump administration, including former Attorney General Bill Barr. The judge wrote, \"Defendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence,\" noting that no one who even communicated with them will testify at trial.\n\nThe judge noted that the DOJ has turned over voluminous information to Hunter already, including \"a forensic copy of the devices seized from The Mac Shop\" -- an admission that the Hunter Biden laptop is real, despite government officials suggesting otherwise before the election.\n\nHunter's lawyers previously threatened to trigger a \"Constitutional crisis\" by having President Joe Biden testify at his son's trial.\n\nHunter is charged with lying on federal firearms purchase forms that he was not a drug user, despite a raging cocaine addiction. His girlfriend eventually threw his gun in a dumpster. The charge carries a term of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nDays after his gun trial, Hunter is slated to face a second trial on nine tax charges in California.", "source": {"uri":

Prosecutors could not point to a single case in which they had agreed to such a generous \"diversion agreement\" for felony gun charges for anyone else, and a probation officer declined to approve the deal.\n\nA lawyer for rapper Kodak Black, who received three years in prison for similar charges, said, \"There's no such thing as not getting jail time on a gun charge... 2 tiers of justice?\"\n\nNonetheless, Hunter argued to the court that he is the victim of \"selective and vindictive prosecution,\" and continued to demand documents to prove it even after the judge shut down the argument. He went so far as to demand information about grand jurors, which is normally secret, because \"it remains possible that in this highly-politicized matter, the grand jury was selected without regard to the bias that people might have.\"\n\nThe DOJ under Hunter's father, President Joe Biden, has charged 1,200 January 6 defendants, sometimes for conduct as petty as trespassing, in D.C., which voted 93% for Biden, and secured a nearly 100% conviction rate.\n\nHunter's lawyers also sought to use the court case to compel the production of documents relating to former officials in the Trump administration, including former Attorney General Bill Barr. The judge wrote, \"Defendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence,\" noting that no one who even communicated with them will testify at trial.\n\nThe judge noted that the DOJ has turned over voluminous information to Hunter already, including \"a forensic copy of the devices seized from The Mac Shop\" -- an admission that the Hunter Biden laptop is real, despite government officials suggesting otherwise before the election.\n\nHunter's lawyers previously threatened to trigger a \"Constitutional crisis\" by having President Joe Biden testify at his son's trial.\n\nHunter is charged with lying on federal firearms purchase forms that he was not a drug user, despite a raging cocaine addiction. His girlfriend eventually threw his gun in a dumpster. The charge carries a term of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nDays after his gun trial, Hunter is slated to face a second trial on nine tax charges in California.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com",

The first son had asked the appellate court to dismiss charges on the grounds that he was the victim of a vindictive prosecution, among other things.\n\nJudges D. Brooks Smith, Cindy Chung, and Patty Shwartz -- who were appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, President Biden, and President Obama, respectively -- said in a unanimous decision that the first son does not have the right to appeal the orders that denied his motions to dismiss at this time.\n\n\"This appeal is DISMISSED because the defendant has not shown the District Court's orders are appealable before final judgment,\" the three jurists wrote in their opinion released Thursday.\n\nMr. Biden had made these three arguments to Judge Maryellen Noreika of the district of Delaware, who is overseeing the gun prosecution brought by Special Counsel David Weiss. Judge Noreika denied all of the motions to dismiss in April.\n\nThe first son said that a plea agreement he signed with Mr. Weiss was actually still in effect; that he was the victim of vindictive prosecutors and Mr. Weiss was pressured by congressional Republicans; and that Mr. Weiss himself was illegally appointed as special counsel.\n\nJudge Noreika declined all of those motions to dismiss on the merits.\n\n\"Non-prosecution agreements do not implicate a right not to be tried,\" the Third Circuit judges wrote of Mr. Biden's assertion that he was still immune due to the plea deal. \"Therefore, the District Court's order is not appealable.\"\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Messrs. Biden and Weiss came to a plea agreement that would have allowed the first son to avoid prison time for failure to make tax filings and tax payments, and that would have put him into a \"pretrial diversion\" program that would also keep him out of jail for the gun purchase.\n\nBoth Mr. Biden's lawyers and Mr. Weiss signed the agreement before Judge Noreika herself refused to accept it, saying that it could be \"unconstitutional\" due to violations of the separations of powers to have the Article III branch enforce an immunity agreement. The parties also could not agree if Mr. Biden was immune from prosecution for violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which led the judge to dismiss the agreement.\n\nMr. Biden also argued that he was the victim of a biased and vindictive prosecution because Mr. Weiss -- who was appointed as Delaware's U.S. attorney by President Trump -- was simply doing the bidding of anti-Biden congressional Republicans. Mr. Biden went so far as to compare himself to the murdered princes and princesses of Europe.\n\n\"To be sure, children of politically powerful individuals enjoy great privilege, but they often become the targets of animus for that very reason,\" Mr. Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, wrote in a January court filing. \"History is replete with children of political figures being abducted and assassinated literally (e.g., murder of Romanov children by Russian revolutionaries) or figuratively (e.g., Odysseus murdering the son of Crown Prince Hector when sacking Troy). Regrettably, political attacks on the children of politicians to harm or influence their parents are not uncommon in America either.\"\n\nJudge Noreika says she found no evidence of such \"vindictiveness\" and promptly denied Mr. Biden's motion to dismiss the gun charges on those grounds. \"This Court has been unable to find any instance where a defendant's familial relationship to a politically-important person on its own gave rise to a claim of selective prosecution,\" she writes. \"Even if that were a cognizable claim, however, Defendant has failed to come forward with 'clear evidence' that similarly situated individuals have not been prosecuted for comparable firearm-related conduct.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Judge Noreika scheduled Mr. Biden's gun trial to begin on the morning of June 3.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_rice@nysun.com", "name": "Matthew Rice", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Third_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Brooks_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

That argument didn't fly.\n\n\"Defendant Robert Hunter Biden is charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(3)1 and two false-statement counts under \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment based on the Second Amendment. In particular, Defendant argues that the indictment must be dismissed because \u00a7 922(g)(3) is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1 (2022). Defendant argues that the charges under \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(1)(A) must be dismissed as well because his alleged false statements regarding drug use are only illegal if \u00a7 922(g)(3) is constitutional,\" U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika wrote Thursday. \"For the reasons set forth below, Defendant's motion is denied.\"\n\n\"The Second Amendment protects 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms,'\" Noreika continued. \"That right, however, is 'not unlimited.'

"Joe Biden's officials questioned why his son Hunter was \"anywhere near this administration ever\" after he appeared in public with the US president while under investigation for tax fraud.\n\nIn emails released by the State Department under Freedom of Information laws, officials in Mr Biden's administration scrambled to deal with the political fallout of an investigation into the president's son in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHunter Biden has been indicted for tax fraud and for illegal possession of a firearm, in a case that has threatened to damage his father's reelection prospects this November.\n\nThe 54-year-old lawyer, who denies all charges, is also the subject of a political investigation by Republicans in Congress, who have seized on an opportunity to tie the US president to his son's business activities.\n\nHeavily-redacted emails, seen by The Telegraph, show private frustration of the president's officials that he faced scrutiny because of his son's legal woes.\n\nIn one message to Stacey Thompson, the State Department's House director, an unnamed official wrote: \"But also, why is Hunter Biden anywhere near this administration ever?\"\n\nThe message came on April 28 2022, shortly after Mr Biden Jr was invited to the White House's annual Easter Egg Roll.\n\nHe had not been seen in public for a fortnight, since fresh questions emerged about the contents of his laptop, which has since become a key part of the congressional investigation into his conduct.\n\nThe previous week, officials on a separate email chain said it was \"only a matter of time\" before journalists started asking questions about Mr Biden Jr's laptop, and that it \"might be worth having a few lines in our back pocket\".\n\nIn a separate email, from March 2023, officials discussed the \"political pivots\" for Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, to take in response to questions about the investigations into Mr Biden Jr.\n\nThey included possible responses for Mr Blinken to questions about the president's son and his laptop.\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives launched an impeachment inquiry into the president over his alleged connection to his son's business dealings in Ukraine, which they allege were corrupt.\n\n'Peddled father's influence'\n\nIt is claimed that Mr Biden Jr peddled his father's influence as vice president in Barack Obama's administration to secure business, and that his father was aware of this arrangement.\n\nThe inquiry has been unable to establish any solid evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, the story does have the potential to damage Mr Biden's reelection bid, with a poll conducted in November showing a majority of the public believe he was aware of his son's activities.\n\nIn response, the White House has accused Republicans of tying Mr Biden to his son's activities in an attempt to distract from legal proceedings against Donald Trump.\n\nMr Biden has issued statements of support for his son and invited him to public events since it was revealed in 2018 that he was under investigation for tax fraud.\n\nMr Biden Jr has since been indicted on the tax charges and a separate charge that he lied about his drug use to buy a gun, which is a federal crime.\n\nTrials over both sets of charges in Delaware and California are set to begin in June.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

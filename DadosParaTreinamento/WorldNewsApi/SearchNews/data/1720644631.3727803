Royal Lodge - now in the spotlight amid the alleged refusal of current occupant Prince Andrew to move out - has stood in its current form since the 19th century. Situated in 98 acres in Windsor Great Park, the property was once known as King's Lodge but its name was changed by the Duke of Cumberland when he became King George IV in 1820. William IV demolished part of Royal Lodge and, for sixty years, senior members of the Royal Household used it mainly as a 'grace-and-favour' home. In 1931, King George V gave permission for his son, Prince Albert, the Duke of York, and his wife to take over the property and they moved in the following year. They used the 30-room Royal Lodge as a private country house, even after they became Duke and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1936. Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret spent many happy days playing in the grounds and making use of Y Bwthyn Bach - the miniature thatched cottage that was given to the future Queen by the people of Wales to mark her sixth birthday in 1932. After George VI's death in 1952, the Queen Mother continued to live at Royal Lodge at weekends until her death in 2002. Her grandson Prince Andrew, the present Duke of York, has lived there since 2004. His daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, love the place as much as he does. Andrew - who now lives in the property with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson - signed a 75-year lease with the Crown Estate when he moved in, making a \u00a31million initial payment. The agreement included a notional rent of \u00a3260,000 a year. Andrew - who remains an outcast from public life amid the fallout from his relationship with peadophile Jeffrey Epstein - has spent nearly \u00a37million carrying out extensive renovations and repairs to the property. He has refused all requests by his brother to move into the smaller Frogmore Cottage. In 1960, Princess Margaret's engagement photos with her husband-to-be Anthony Armstrong-Jones were taken at Royal Lodge. The gardens reflect the character of the late Queen Mother, who spent many hours working there. She did not change the entire 98 acres but concentrated on the 30 acres surrounding Royal Lodge that she preferred to call her personal garden. The royal installed paths lined with hedges and trees and beautiful flower beds containing all her favourites, such as Azaleas - her particular favourites. The garden became a haven of rest and tranquility, where she spent countless hours and days accompanied on occasion by the then Prince Charles. As his transformation of Highgrove House proves, has always shared his grandmother's passion for flowers and plants. Prince Andrew and Fergie have preferred to re-organise the interior of the house, making it more up to date and modern. There is a majestic drawing room and dining hall and splendid arched gothic windows. However, the shelves are said to be filled with Sarah's collection of novelty teapots. The grounds of Royal Lodge include a gardener's cottage and the Royal Chapel of All Saints, where Princess Beatrice and Edo Mapelli Mozzi married in 2020 in a ceremony attended by the late Queen and Prince Philip. There is also a swimming pool and tennis court. If the King gets his way, Andrew will have to give up these delights for the more modest surroundings of Frogmore Cottage or another property. If rumours are to be believed, Prince William and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, could be the next occupants of Royal Lodge with their young family.", "summary": "Royal Lodge - now in the spotlight amid the alleged refusal of current occupant Prince Andrew to move out - has stood in its current form since the 19th century.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-13501229/Prince-Andrew-Royal-Lodge-Queen-Mother.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/06/14/85787219-0-image-a-91_1717679135212.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:14:20", "author": "Brian Hoey,Editor", "authors": ["Brian Hoey", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.253}

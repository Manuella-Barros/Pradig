crushed West Ham United 4-0 in an impressive Premier League opener on Sunday.\n\nThe Belgium striker, a \u00a375 million ($97.6 million, 82.5 million euros) signing from Everton, struck either side of half-time to take his tally of goals against West Ham to 11 in his last 11 appearances.\n\nSubstitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba added late goals that gave a true reflection of United's dominance and sent Jose Mourinho's side to the top of the early-season standings on goal difference.\n\nUnited join Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on maximum points and while West Ham offered scant resistance, the early signs suggest Mourinho's men will not end the season 24 points off the pace again.\n\nWhile Lukaku took the headlines, Nemanja Matic also enjoyed an assured home debut following his \u00a340 million switch from Chelsea and there were strong showings from Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford as well.\n\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic, who gave league debuts to Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez, will hope for better when his side visit Southampton next weekend.\n\nHaving opened his account in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup loss to Real Madrid in Macedonia, Lukaku now has three goals in two United games.\n\nHe might have been able to celebrate his first league goal even sooner.\n\nMkhitaryan's pass freed Juan Mata and when the Spaniard's shot was blocked by West Ham goalkeeper Hart, he squared the ball to Lukaku, but the 24-year-old could not get a shot away.\n\n- Rashford hits post -\n\nMata's darting runs into the box were bringing United joy and he almost broke the deadlock when he raced onto Pogba's clever dinked pass and slipped a shot past Hart, only for Angelo Ogbonna to hack clear.\n\nUnited's pressure told in the 33rd minute thanks to a move started and finished by home debutants.\n\nMatic had already seduced the home fans with his awareness and coolness on the ball and he sprang a United counter-attack

the left-hand post and nestled in the side-netting on the other side of the goal.\n\nWhile United old boy Hernandez endured a thankless first half on his return to Old Trafford, Andre Ayew threatened an equaliser in stoppage time with a rasping drive that David de Gea had to parry.\n\nLukaku picked up where he had left off in the second half, first releasing Rashford to run through and shoot wide and then doubling his tally in the 52nd minute.\n\nFormer Manchester City stalwart Zabaleta's foul on Rashford gave United a free-kick on the left and from Mkhitaryan's cross, Lukaku stole between Winston Reid and Arthur Masuaku to plant a header past Hart.\n\nArnautovic served a reminder of West Ham's threat with a header that De Gea was obliged to tip over, but it seemed only to redouble the

team-mate.\n\nMANCHESTER, United Kingdom, Aug 13 - Romelu Lukaku introduced himself to Old Trafford in triumphant fashion with two goals as Manchester United crushed West Ham United 4-0 in an impressive Premier League opener on Sunday.\n\nThe Belgium striker, a \u00a375 million ($97.6 million, 82.5 million euros) signing from Everton, struck either side of half-time to take his tally of goals against West Ham to 11 in his last 11 appearances.\n\nSubstitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba added late goals that gave a true reflection of United's dominance and sent Jose Mourinho's side to the top of the early-season standings on goal difference.\n\nUnited join Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on maximum points and while West Ham offered scant resistance, the early signs suggest Mourinho's men will not end the season 24 points off the pace again.\n\nWhile Lukaku took the headlines, Nemanja Matic also enjoyed an assured home debut following his \u00a340 million switch from Chelsea and there were strong showings from Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford as well.\n\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic, who gave league debuts to Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez, will hope for better when his side visit Southampton next weekend.\n\nHaving opened his account in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup loss to Real Madrid in Macedonia, Lukaku now has three goals in two United games.\n\nHe might have been able to celebrate his first league goal even sooner.\n\nMkhitaryan's pass freed Juan Mata and when the Spaniard's shot was blocked by West Ham goalkeeper Hart, he squared the ball to Lukaku, but the 24-year-old could not get a shot away.\n\n- Rashford hits post -\n\nMata's darting runs into the box were bringing United joy and he almost broke the deadlock when he raced onto Pogba's clever dinked pass and slipped a shot past Hart, only for Angelo Ogbonna to hack clear.\n\nUnited's pressure told in the 33rd minute thanks to a

his \u00a340 million switch from Chelsea and there were strong showings from Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford as well.\n\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic, who gave league debuts to Joe

an equaliser in stoppage time with a rasping drive that David de Gea had to parry.\n\nLukaku picked up where he had left off in the second half, first releasing Rashford to run through and shoot wide

Winston Reid and Arthur Masuaku to plant a header past Hart.\n\nArnautovic served a reminder of West Ham's threat with a header that De Gea was obliged to tip over, but it seemed only to redouble the home side's determination to stretch their lead.\n\nAfter Rashford had left the right-hand upright shuddering with a curler from the left-hand apex of the area, Mkhitaryan released Martial to coolly

West Ham gave Premier League debuts to four new additions - Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez.\n\nUnited's main problem last season was scoring at Old Trafford as they managed just 26, which was two less than relegated Hull City.

Mkhitaryan clipped a free-kick into the box from the left and Lukaku rose ahead of his marker Arthur Masuaku, who seemed to be sharing a joke with the striker before the ball was played in, to glance home from eight yards out.\n\nWest Ham almost replied instantly when Edmilson Fernandes' cross found Marko Arnautovic, who got the wrong side of Daley Blind, but his header was tipped onto the crossbar by David de Gea.\n\nSwansea vs Man Utd\n\nAugust 19, 2017, 11:30am\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\nUnited pressed on for more goals as Lukaku hunted a hat-trick.

Obiang.\n\nPicking up the loose ball, Rashford tore into the West Ham half and slid a pass into the box for Lukaku, whose first-time shot clanged off the left-hand post and nestled in the side-netting on the other side of the goal.\n\nWhile United old boy Hernandez endured a thankless first half on his return to Old Trafford, Andre Ayew threatened an equaliser in stoppage time with a rasping drive that David de Gea had to parry.\n\nLukaku picked up where he had left off in the second half, first releasing Rashford to run through and shoot wide and then doubling his tally in the 52nd minute.\n\nFormer Manchester City stalwart Zabaleta's foul on Rashford gave United a free-kick on the left and from Mkhitaryan's cross, Lukaku stole between Winston Reid and Arthur Masuaku to plant a header past Hart.\n\nArnautovic served a reminder of West Ham's threat with a header that De Gea was obliged to tip over, but it seemed only to redouble the home side's determination to stretch their lead.\n\nAfter Rashford had left the right-hand upright shuddering with a curler from the left-hand apex of the area, Mkhitaryan released Martial to coolly tuck away United's third before Pogba swept in the fourth from 20 yards.", "timeCrawl": "17:10:00", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8944926",

struck either side of half-time to take his tally of goals against West Ham to 11 in his last 11 appearances.\n\nSubstitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba added late goals that gave a true reflection of United's dominance and sent Jose Mourinho's side to the top of the early-season standings on goal difference.\n\nUnited join Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on maximum points and while West Ham offered scant resistance, the early signs suggest Mourinho's men will not end the season 24 points off the pace again.\n\nWhile Lukaku took the headlines, Nemanja Matic also enjoyed an assured home debut following his 40 million switch from Chelsea and there were strong showings from Pogba, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford as well.\n\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic, who gave league debuts to Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez, will hope for better when his side visit Southampton next weekend.\n\nHaving opened his account in Tuesday's UEFA Super Cup loss to Real Madrid in Macedonia, Lukaku now has three goals in two United games.\n\nHe might have been able to celebrate his first league goal even sooner.\n\nMkhitaryan's pass freed Juan Mata and when the Spaniard's shot was blocked by West Ham goalkeeper Hart, he squared the ball to Lukaku, but the 24-year-old could not get a shot away.\n\nMata's darting runs into the box were bringing United joy and he almost broke the deadlock when he raced onto Pogba's clever dinked pass and slipped a shot past Hart, only for Angelo Ogbonna to hack clear.\n\nUnited's pressure told in the 33rd minute thanks to a move started and finished by home debutants.\n\nMatic had already seduced the home fans with his awareness and coolness on the ball and he sprang a United counter-attack by racing out to block an attempted pass by Pedro Obiang.\n\nPicking up the loose ball, Rashford tore into the West Ham half and slid a pass into the box for Lukaku, whose first-time shot clanged off the left-hand post and nestled in the side-netting on the other side of the goal.\n\nWhile United old boy Hernandez endured a thankless first half on his return to Old Trafford, Andre Ayew threatened an equaliser in stoppage time with a rasping drive that David de Gea had to parry.\n\nLukaku picked up where he had left off in the second half, first releasing Rashford to run through and shoot wide and then doubling his tally in the 52nd minute.\n\nFormer Manchester City stalwart Zabaleta's foul on Rashford gave United a free-kick on the left and from Mkhitaryan's cross, Lukaku stole between Winston Reid and Arthur Masuaku to plant a header past Hart.\n\nArnautovic served a reminder of West Ham's threat with a header that De Gea was obliged to tip over, but it seemed only to redouble the home side's determination to stretch their lead.\n\nAfter Rashford had left the right-hand upright shuddering with a curler from the left-hand apex of the area, Mkhitaryan released Martial to coolly tuck away United's third before Pogba swept in the fourth from 20 yards.", "timeCrawl": "17:25:00", "sim": 0.7372549176216125, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date":

Remained a virtual spectator in the second half as United bossed the game.\n\nANTONIO VALENCIA 6.5 - The United skipper played right-back as Mourinho reverted to a back-four and hardly put a foot wrong, other than a late challenge on Arnautovic that earned him a booking.\n\nPHIL JONES 7 - Preferred to Smalling and Lindelof which shows what Mourinho thinks of Jones if he can just stay fit. Highlight of an assured display was a crunching tackle to stop Arnautovic in his tracks in the first half.\n\nERIC BAILLY 7 - The combative Ivorian was brought straight back after missing the UEFA Super Cup through suspension and showed why. Dominant in defence and a threat at set-pieces. Booked for a foul on Hernandez.\n\nDALEY BLIND 6 - Solid on the left and provided a steady supply of set-pieces. Went close to a goal towards the end but his volley into the ground bounced just over the bar.\n\nNEMANJA MATIC 8 - He has brought a whole new dimension to United since his \u00a340m move from Chelsea. Anchors the team superbly and gets forward effectively - including one run past four West Ham players in the first half here. Outstanding.\n\nMidfielder Nemanja Matic, another summer signing, also enjoyed a good Red Devils debut\n\nPAUL POGBA 8 - United hope that Matic's arrival will release Pogba and there are certainly signs of that working. The powerful Frenchman bullied West Ham at time and his excellent build-up play deserved more from his teammates. Capped a commanding performance with a well-taken goal late on.\n\nMARCUS RASHFORD 7.5 - Slipped an exquisite pass into Lukaku's path for the first goal as their partnership continues to blossom. Should have scored himself as well but steered a shot wide when clean through in the second half before hitting the foot of the post with an excellent effort.\n\nJUAN MATA 6 - Got behind the West Ham defence twice early but couldn't provide the finish. Faded a little after that and was the first United player to be replaced 15 minutes from time.\n\nHENRIKH MKHITARYAN 7 - Another enterprising performance from the Armenian who provided the cross, a freekick clipped nicely to the edge of the six-yard box, for Lukaku to head the second goal and the pass for Martial to score the third.\n\nROMELU LUKAKU 8.5 - Hard to fault a two-goal Premier League debut. Lukaku was signed for \u00a375m to kill off the likes of West Ham and he delivered on his first appearance at Old Trafford. That's 11 in 12 games against the Hammers. His powerful running caused them all sorts of problems and he provided two clinical finishes.\n\nLukaku scored his first goal with his left foot, before doubling his tally with a towering header\n\nSubs: Martial (for Rashford 80), Smalling, Lingard (for Mkhitaryan 87), Romero, Herrera, Fellaini (for Mata 75, 6), Darmian.\n\nScorers: Lukaku 33, 52, Martial 87, Pogba 90\n\nBooked: Bailly, Valencia\n\nWest Ham United (4-2-3-1)\n\nJOE HART 5.5 - Humbling return to Manchester for the England No.1 on loan from Manchester City. Produced a fine early save to thwart Mata, but becoming the first away goalkeeper to keep three clean sheets at Old Trafford was always going to be a tough ask. Will be hugely disappointed to concede four.\n\nPABLO ZABALETA 5.5 - The other former City player won't look back on his debut with any fondness either. Got forward well on a couple of occasions when he had the opportunity, and produced a fantastic sliding challenge to deny Lukaku a hat-trick, but that was about it.\n\nPablo Zabaleta had a difficult debut and was booked for a foul on the pacy Marcus Rashford\n\nWINSTON REID 5 - Failed to cut out Mkhitaryan's freekick when Lukaku headed the second. Tried to marshal his defence but it was a losing battle as United dominated from start to finish.\n\nANGELO OGBONNA 6 - Made some fine interceptions in the first half to keep his team in the game but was perhaps fortunate to get away with an untidy challenge on Lukaku in the penalty box.\n\nARTHUR MASUAKU 5 - Landed his team in trouble with a careless header to Mkhitaryan early on and didn't even get off the ground when Lukaku glanced in the second goal.\n\nPEDRO OBIANG 6 - Snapped into some string tackles but was guilty of losing the ball midway into United's half with West Ham on the attack as the home side broke away to score the first goal.\n\nMARK NOBLE 6 - Flashed a volley over from one of West Ham's few chances in the first half but was overrun in midfield at times. Replaced in a double substitution on the hour.\n\nANDRE AYEW 5 - Came close to an equaliser with the last kick of the first half as West Ham rallied briefly, but offered little down the right flank apart from that.\n\nEDIMILSON FERNANDES 5 - Didn't see enough of the ball to create anything of value as the Hammers were pinned back for long periods. No surprise to see his number up first when changes were made.\n\nEdimilson Fernandes produced West Ham's only shot on target but was subbed off on the hour\n\nMARKO ARNAUTOVIC 6 - Showed flashes of what he can do but there is so much more to come from the Austrian. Clipped the top of the bar with a header in the second half and should have done better with an attempt well over the bar when well placed.\n\nJAVIER HERNANDEZ 5 - Disappointing debut from the former United favourite on his return to Old Trafford. Started brightly but had very little service and drifted out of the game without posing a threat. Hard to judge him on a one-sided game like this.\n\nSubs: Cresswell (for Masuaku 81), Fonte, Adrian, Sakho (for Fernandes 60, 6), Collins, Byram, Rice (for Noble 61, 6).\n\nBooked: Zabaleta\n\nReferee: Martin Atkinson 7\n\nStar man: Romelu Lukaku\n\nAttendance: 74,928\n\nJavier Hernandez endured a tough West Ham bow as he was isolated for much of the match", "timeCrawl": "17:18:00", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "-03-01", "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 737, "date": "-04-02", "textStart": 730}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8945883", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But they were all put in the shade by the exceptional duo making their United league debuts, Nemanja Matic and Romelu Lukaku.\n\nThe former provided the platform Paul Pogba needed last season, freeing him to dictate play for deep. After 28 minutes the Frenchman provided the game's most breathtaking moment, a fabulous clipped pass over the West Ham defence that freed Mata in behind.\n\nHart was out quickly enough to limit Mata's options to a square pass for Lukaku but Reid did well to thump clear.\n\nStill West Ham were unable to live with an unchained Manchester United, who were remorseless in punishing their visitors on a rare burst forward. Pedro Obiang was caught in midfield by Matic. Rashford burst forward, carrying the ball nearly 50 yards before slipping through Lukaku.\n\nThe Belgian had nine goals from 12 games against the Hammers beforehand and was not about to spurn such a perfect chance, clipping a shot past Hart and into the net via the left post.\n\nA powerful drive from Edimilson Fernandes forced David De Gea into a parry on the stroke of half-time but West Ham were offering little to challenge their hosts.\n\nArthur Masuaku in particular could do with explaining why he didn't even start between Lukaku and the ball from a Henrikh Mkhitaryan free-kick. It did not need a \u00a375million striker to flick a simple header past Hart.\n\nTo Bilic's credit he responded to the worsening scoreline by chasing goals, throwing on Diafra Sakho for the ineffectual Mark Noble on the hour. It was almost an immediate success but well-placed from a corner the rusty striker, playing only his fifth game since the start of last season, could not get a decent connection on his header.\n\nSimilarly Mourinho might normally shut up shop at 2-0 but they continued to pour forward in numbers, led by the whirlwind Rashford. Pablo Zabaleta could only delay his progress once at the cost of a yellow. Then the 19-year-old cut loose and deserved a goal for a vicious shot that cracked back off the post.\n\nRashford was not to get his reward today, his replacement Martial getting the third (before teeing up Pogba), but he doubtless will in the weeks to come. With Lukaku leading the way, this United side should have plenty of goals to share around.", "timeCrawl": "16:52:00", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8942920", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The striker loves scoring against West Ham - netting 9 times in his last ten appearances against the Hammers - and was brilliant in his Premier League debut for his new club, leading the line powerfully and bagging an all-important brace.\n\nMost encouragingly, he also linked up especially well with Marcus Rashford, who repeatedly darted inside from off the wing to play Lukaku into space. The pair had a good understanding of one another's games and will only get better the more they play alongside one another.\n\nHernandez needs more support Hernandez cannot be expected to carry his team mates (Getty)\n\nThere is no doubting that Hernandez is a quality striker, but playing as a lone striker in a 4-3-3 formation that quickly saw Andre Ayew and Marko Arnautovi\u0107 drop into deep positions, the Mexican looked incredible isolated.\n\nAnd despite tirelessly chasing down every lost cause and harrying the United defence throughout, Hernandez touched the ball the fewest amount of times of any of the 22 players to start the match - including the goalkeepers. If he's going to succeed at West Ham, he needs somebody alongside him to play off of.\n\nChelsea were wrong to sell Matic this summer Matic ran the game from the middle of the park (Getty)\n\nChelsea's title defence got off to an absolutely disastrous start this weekend, as Burnley ran them ragged in a shock 3-2 win. Worse: both Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas saw red, leaving Antonio Conte with a real selection headache for the away match against Tottenham.\n\nIn stark contrast, United played exceptionally well against West Ham, with new signing Nemanja Matic particularly impressive in the middle of the pitch. He was one of United's busiest players, and particularly effective in the air. His happiness to do the dirty work meanwhile allowed Paul Pogba to push forward, and he already looks a superb addition to United's starting XI.\n\nWest Ham fans shouldn't lose hope Bilic's side will do better than last season (Getty)\n\nSlaven Bilic's side look far stronger than they did last season and, against lesser sides, the likes of Hernandez, Ayew and Arnautovi\u0107 prosper. The side also have a number of talented young players coming through, including new signings Anouar El Mhassani and Sead Hak\u0161abanovi\u0107, as well as academy graduate Declan Rice, who was given a little run out here.\n\nManchester United away is one of the hardest opening weekend fixtures out there, and there is no shame in defeat. But it is important that West Ham take something from one of their next two away games - against Southampton and Newcastle respectively.\n\nFour for United and it could have been more Martial scored after coming on in the second-half (Getty)\n\nWhen United last played West Ham at Old Trafford in the Premier League, they drew 1-1 despite dominating possession and taking 17 shots on goal. The performance epitomised United's struggles last season, with the side having one of the lowest big chance conversion rates in the league.\n\nThis season things already look to be different - with Romelu Lukaku wasting little time in opening up his United account. But Mourinho's side were still guilty of wasting a number of gilt-edged opportunities in the first half, and they should have killed this game long before they did. If United are going to win the league this year, they need to perform the way they did in the second half for the full 90 minutes.\n\nMore about: Premier League Manchester United West Ham Romelu Lukaku Nemanja Matic Slaven Bilic Andre Ayew Paul Pogba Marko Arnautovic Marcus Rashford Anouar El Mhassani Sead Hak\u0161abanovi\u0107 Reuse content", "timeCrawl": "17:01:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8943836", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"Romelu Lukaku scored on his Premier League debut for the Red Devils while the Hammers' four big name signings appeared\n\nGet Manchester United FC updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nRomelu Lukaku bagged a double on his Premier League debut for Manchester United as the club's summer dealings shone in their season opener.\n\nOld Trafford's faithful were treated to a thumping 4-0 win over West Ham in the late Sunday kick-off.\n\nNemanja Matic's arrival from Chelsea was marked with an assured performance, backed up by Lukaku's finishing after his move from Everton, before late goals for Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba.\n\nFor West Ham, Joe Hart, Marko Arnautovic, Pablo Zabaleta and Javier Hernandez all started.\n\nHere's how the two club's new boys fared, according to David McDonnell at Old Trafford.\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED Nemanja Matic\n\nJose Mourinho was surprised his former club Chelsea were willing to sell Matic to him, as was current Stamford Bridge boss Antonio Conte, and it's easy to see why after such an imperious performance from the Serbian.\n\nMatic is precisely what United needed, a midfield anchorman to protect the back-four, break up the play and give balance to the entire team.\n\nBut Matic, as he proved against West Ham, is much more than a physical midfield enforcer, even if it was his interception, winning the ball from the feet of Pedro Obiang, that led to United's opener.\n\nHe has quick feet, superb control and touch, and possesses an impressive array of passing, all of which makes him such a key signing for United and Mourinho. If he carries on playing like this for United, Chelsea will be racked by regret and self-recrimination that they ever let him go.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Romelu Lukaku\n\nLukaku scored on his debuts for West Brom and Everton, and continued that impressive record by bagging two goals on his Premier League debut for Manchester United.\n\nThe first was a rasping finish in off the near post after impressive work from Marcus Rashford and Matic, who won the ball to spark the move that led to the goal.\n\nLukaku's second was simpler but no less significant, a glancing header from a Henrikh Mkhitaryan free-kick which left West Ham keeper Joe Hart rooted to the spot and gave Jose Mourinho's side the breathing space they needed to see out the game with a deserved and comfortable win.\n\nLukaku could not have wished for a better debut following his \u00a375million - rising to \u00a390m - move from Everton, his power, physicality and clinical finishing filling the void left by the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the summit of United's attack.\n\nRead More Football transfer news 2017 WEST HAM Joe Hart\n\nThe cheers of 'City reject' began when Hart came out for the warm-up and were cranked up by the Stretford End as West Ham's on-loan keeper stood in front of Manchester United's fans prior to kick-off.\n\nHart claimed he had nothing to prove to Pep Guardiola, only to Slaven Bilic and England boss Gareth Southgate, but the 30-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Torino, was under huge scrutiny at Old Trafford.\n\nHart was certainly kept busy by United's relentless pressure and equipped himself well, coming off his line sharply in the 18 minute to deny Juan Mata, and showed decent anticipation to palm away a dangerous cross from Henrikh Mkhitaryan just before the half-hour.\n\nThere was little he could do to keep out Lukaku's thumping opener or the forward's second, for which he was left exposed by his lamentable defence.\n\nPablo Zabaleta\n\nReleased by Manchester City in the summer, Zabaleta found himself back in his former adopted city for the opening game of the new campaign, along with former Blues team-mate Hart.\n\nHe may have lacked the pace and dynamism demanded of full-backs by Guardiola, but Bilic wanted Zabelata's experience, although that counted for little with the Argentine stranded upfield as United launched the breakneck counter-attack that led to their opener.\n\nZabaleta was also culpable for United's second goal, his cynical foul on Marcus Rashford earning him a yellow card and allowing Mkhitaryan to pick out Lukaku from the set-piece to establish a 2-0 lead. Not a happy return to Manchester for Zabaleta.\n\nMarko Arnautovic\n\nSigned from Stoke for \u00a320m this summer, rising to \u00a325m, Arnautovic was largely anonymous here, his task made harder given he was up against Antonio Valencia, described by Mourinho as \"the best right-back in the world\".\n\nArnautovic plundered some spectacular goals for Stoke, but his Premier League debut for West Ham was strangely subdued, his only moment of note coming in the first-half coming when he was ruled offside, then compounded that error by thudding a shot against the frame of the goal after the whistle had gone, much to the amusement of the home fans.\n\nArnautovic did clip the bar with a looping header just before the hour mark, but such moments were few and far between from the Austria international.\n\nJavier Hernandez\n\nFormer Manchester United striker Hernandez received a warm reception before kick-off on his return to Old Trafford, but the Mexico international, who spent five years with the Reds, scoring 59 goals in 157 appearances, did little to trouble his old club.\n\nIt took Hernandez, a predatory finisher but also an habitual offside offender throughout his career, just two minutes to ensure the assistant referee's flag was raised, although West Ham played so deep and had so little of the ball there were few occasions when the 29-year-old forward was able to get in behind United's defence.\n\nOne moment summed up Hernandez's afternoon, just after the hour, when he found himself in bags of space in the centre circle, under no pressure, and proceeded to under hit a pass which was intercepted with ease by United full-back Valencia.

You sign a \u00a375m striker. Football is a simple game sometimes and in acquiring Romelu Lukaku, Manchester United may have answered Jose Mourinho's most pressing concern.\n\nToo many points dropped to the likes of West Ham United scuppered United's last Premier League campaign, which was subsequently sacrificed for victory in the Europa League. By scoring twice here, with Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba's late strike crowning a 4-0 victory, Lukaku not only extended his own healthy scoring record against the Hammers but eased fears of the same old problems rearing their head.\n\nLukaku and Nemanja Matic were handed their league debuts by Mourinho but United's other summer signing was not included in the match day squad. Victor Lindelof's pre-season performances could be described as shaky at best, with the \u00a331m acquisition from Benfica looking a touch daunted by the new badge on his chest. Quite how dropping him for the league opener will help with that remains to be seen.\n\nHis teammates made a scrappy start to their new Premier League campaign, being dragged into a midfield battle of enthusiastic tackling with their visitors, but United gradually began to enjoy more and more time on the ball in the final third as the half progressed. Yet despite their dominance, they struggled to fashion efforts on Hart's goal. After the struggles to score at home of Mourinho's first year, returning season ticket holders could see a familiar pattern emerging.\n\nThe best of their few early chances came when Juan Mata slipped in behind, inviting on-loan Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart out to block the shot. The rebound fell to the feet of Lukaku but, six yards out, he appeared to stumble over his own size 13\u00bds before Slaven Bilic's defence cleared their lines. Mata was through again shortly after following a lovely looped pass over the top by Pogba, but the Spaniard's square pass for Lukaku at the far post was cut out.\n\nYou do not have access to view this Atom.\n\nThe momentum was building but a breakthrough still felt some way off until just after the half-hour mark and some direct running from Rashford. Picking the ball up in his own half, the teenager set off charging at a muddled bunch of retreating defenders, making a cute shimmy to his right before playing the pass to slice through the West Ham line. Lukaku's finish was emphatic, rebounding in off one of the uprights, and he rightly took the attention as a goal-scoring debutant, but Rashford's quick, direct running made it.\n\nRead more Five things we learned from United's impressive win over West Ham\n\nToo often last year, United's attack was cumbersome, particularly at Old Trafford. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was an excellent role model for the dressing room and a match-winner on his day, but he could slow United's counters down and had a bad habit of missing good chances. Lukaku can, on occasion, perform just as awkwardly, but he has the lick of pace that no 35-year-old forward can match.\n\nOn this early evidence, United now have a focal point whose talents suit their desired style of play and one who can bring out the best of those around him. Rashford was slipped in shortly after the interval and left Pablo Zabaleta, another ex-City player making his debut for the visitors, for dead. The youngster's effort was off target but it was a warning shot.\n\nMartial came off the bench to add United's third with a cool finish (Getty)\n\nUnited and Lukaku's second followed minutes later and was a reminder of the striker's power rather than pace. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's free-kick from the left hung high in West Ham's box but there was only one man likely to meet it, with Lukaku's simple header sending the ball past Hart and into the bottom-right hand corner.\n\nPogba's solo effort sealed the victory with a deserved goal for the midfielder (Getty)\n\nHe could have had a third but for Zabaleta's timely block on the hour mark and Rashford came close to a deserved goal, striking the foot of the post with a teasing effort from the left flank. Eventually though, United's victory was capped off with two examples of the new, fluid attacking play we can expect to see at Old Trafford this season. First, in the 87th minute, substitute Martial slotted past Hart after quick-thinking from Mkhitaryan had sent him through. Then, after being central to much of United's pretty play, Pogba decided to go it alone, carrying the ball forward unchallenged before angling a shot past Hart. By that point, West Ham's heads had already dropped. They will not be the only team to leave Old Trafford bruised and well-beaten this season.\n\nMore about: Manchester United West Ham United Premier League Romelu Lukaku Paul Pogba Jose Mourinho Reuse content", "timeCrawl": "17:26:00", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8946936", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He fed Rashford who slipped a delightful ball through to Lukaku and the Belgian did the rest, firing in off the near post.\n\nWest Ham had a glorious chance to go into the break level after the ball fell to Edmilson Fernandes in the Reds' box, but his effort was palmed away by David De Gea, meaning United led at the break.\n\nThe Reds had a chance to double their lead five minutes into the second half, as Pogba fed Rashford, but he sliced his effort wide of Hart's far post from a tight angle.\n\nUnited did double their lead moments later as a Mkhitaryan free-kick from the left found that man again, Lukaku, who headed neatly into the far corner. Mkhitaryan had a goal disallowed for offside, before Marko Arnautovic's looping header at the other end rebounded off the crossbar.\n\nIt was becoming an attacking onslaught as Rashford clattered the post with a rasping effort before Daley Blind's volley found the roof of the net. Substitute Martial added a deserved third late on, slotting past Hart having been played clean through by Mkhitaryan, before Pogba wrapped up a fine United display with a low drilled effort which is performance deserved.\n\nTHE LINE-UPS\n\nUnited: De Gea; Valencia (c), Bailly, Jones, Blind; Matic, Pogba; Mata (Fellaini 75), Mkhitaryan (Lingard 88), Rashford (Martial 79); Lukaku.\n\nSubs not used: S. Romero, Darmian, Smalling, Herrera.\n\nBooked: Bailly, Valencia.\n\nWest Ham: Hart, Zabaleta, Reid, Ogbonna, Masuaku (Cresswell 81), Noble (c) (Rice 60), Obiang, Fernandes (Sakho 60), Arnautovic, Ayew, Chicharito.\n\nSubs not used: Adrian, Byram, Fonte, Collins.\n\nBooked: Zabaleta, Ogbonna.\n\nTALKING POINTS\n\nROM AT THE DOUBLE\n\nLukaku will grab the headlines after two superbly taken Old Trafford debut goals. The big Belgian latched onto Rashford's pass to fire a bullet past Hart and send the Old Trafford faithful into jubilation before heading neatly past Hart early in the second half. That was his 10th and 11th goals in just 10 games against the Hammers. The Reds fans will hope goalscoring records like that will continue in a United shirt.\n\nJONES NULLIFIES RETURNING RED CHICHARITO\n\nRight from the off, Jones was obviously tasked with man-marking the former Red, Chicharito, who scored 37 goals in 103 Premier League games for the Reds. But the former fans' favourite was not given a sniff of the ball largely thanks to Jones who displayed his all-action style throughout, making some crucial sliding tackles, whilst complementing that with an assured, professional display in the heart of the Reds' defence.\n\nMATIC IMPRESSIVE ON DEBUT\n\nThe Serbian was excellent on his Old Trafford debut, constantly winning the ball in midfield and setting the Reds away on attacking flourishes. In fact, the rangy midfielder played a pivotal role in the Reds' opener as he won the ball off Angelo Ogbonna before setting Rashford away, who went on to lay the ball off for Lukaku to score. Matic also showed the fans another side of his game as he cutely skipped past three West Ham players down the right side, before a cheeky 'scoop pass' brought a huge cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT FOR UNITED?\n\nNext up is a trip to the Liberty Stadium to face Swansea on Saturday (12:30 BST kick off). Historically, United have a good record against the Welsh outfit, winning seven, drawing two and losing three of the previous 12 meetings in the six seasons the sides have faced each other following Swansea's promotion. Reds boss Jose Mourinho will be reunited with his former understudy, Paul Clement, as United look to build on such an encouraging start to the new Premier League season.", "timeCrawl": "17:29:00", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 17, "amb": false, "textEnd": 31}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8947296", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "id": 262, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "id": 761, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The Belgian netted either side of halftime on his league debut, before Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba finished things off in the dying minutes. It was a strong performance from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's men -- let's hope it sets the tone for a successful campaign.\n\nThe game got off to a lively start, the ball bouncing off both teams as technique took a backseat to the classic Premier League swashbuckle. Gradually, however, United began to take control, and only the timely intervention of two Hammers defenders prevented Lukaku from opening the scoring after a quarter-of-an-hour. A few minutes later Pogba picked out Juan Mata with a glorious chip, though the Spaniard opted to pass rather than shoot, and allowed Angelo Ogbonna to clear the ball to safety.\n\nWest Ham, spearheaded by former United striker Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, remained a threat on the counter-attack, but a swift United break just past the half hour proved their undoing. The impressive Nemanja Mati\u0107 nicked the ball in midfield, freeing up Marcus Rashford to surge down the left. His pass was weighted perfectly for the onrushing Lukaku, whose low shot kissed the post on its way beyond Joe Hart.\n\nWest Ham had no immediate reply, but with United's lead at the halftime whistle so slender, patience was a commodity the visitors could afford. But not for long. Within seven minutes of the restart United were two up, Lukaku doubling his tally in embarrassingly simplistic fashion. The Belgian escaped his marker en route to a floated Henrikh Mkhitaryan free-kick, with Hart powerless to prevent the bullet header rippling the net.\n\nFrom then on, it was one-way traffic: United were unwilling to show mercy, and chased a third with as much vigour as they had the opener. A brilliant curling Rashford effort almost iced the cake, though curled against the woodwork and agonisingly across the face of goal. An equally spectacular effort came from Daley Blind on the volley with 20 minutes left, though his effort narrowly cleared the crossbar.\n\nIt took a long time coming, but come the third goal eventually did. Some smart one-touch passing culminated in Mkhitaryan threading through for substitute Martial, who made no mistake from inside the area.\n\nIt turns out that goals are a lot like London buses, and the second pulled up moments later. Martial turned provider with a simple through ball, though really it was Pogba that did all the work.

"body": "The Hammers kicked off the new campaign with a forlorn, four-goal defeat at Old Trafford, where a double-barrelled blast from their nemesis Romelu Lukaku and late goals from substitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba made it a nightmare start to the season at the so-called Theatre of Dreams.\n\nwest Ham had handed debuts to all four summer signings as on-loan Joe Hart took his place between the posts, with former Manchester City team-mate Pablo Zabaleta lining up at right-back, while record-signing Marko Arnautovi\u0107 slotted in just behind Javier Hernandez in the left-hand channel for a Hammers team missing the injured trio Manuel Lanzini, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Michail Antonio.\n\nMaking a return to Old Trafford, the Mexican who netted 59 times in 156 outings for United found himself going it alone up-front and maybe 'Chicharito' knew what lay in store for the Eastenders, with both teams preparing to kick-off the Premier League's 25th season, the 'Little Pea' could be seen kneeling on the halfway line praying high into the Manchester skies\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho fielded two new faces as Nemanja Mati\u0107 his \u00a340m capture from Chelsea lined up alongside \u00a390m Lukaku, who having scored nine times for Everton in his last 10 outings against the Hammers was the last person Slaven Bili\u0107 wanted to see.\n\nAnd with just seven minutes on the clock, giving an indication of things to come, the Belgian bulldozer burst down the left before forcing the first corner of the game and then Lukaku nodded down on to the penalty-spot but no home shirts were in the vicinity to convert.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan and Daley Blind each blazed over with ambitious efforts and, as the Hammers battled to halt the Red tide, Pedro Obiang, Mark Noble and Andr\u00e9 Ayew each dug deep to stem the flow with juddering midfield tackles.\n\nBut with Noble flying in once too often, Mkhitaryan's quick free-kick released Juan Mata, who was denied by the ankles of the advancing Hart and when the Spaniard returned the ball into the six-yard box, Arthur Masuaku brilliantly thwarted Lukaku.\n\nRestricted to brief sorties upfield, West Ham were not causing David De Gea any problems but midway through the half, Hernandez did volley Noble's clever chip back into the danger zone but neither Arnautovi\u0107 nor Ayew could apply the crucial stud.\n\nAs the half-hour mark neared, Pogba released Mata, who clipped the ball beyond Hart but the retreating Angelo Ogbonna cleared as Lukaku raced in for the kill.\n\nThe flying Hart then punched the ball off Lukaku's head at the far post, a split-second before the United striker clattered into Winston Reid, who needed treatment for the flying assault.\n\nIt really was only looking a matter of time until Lukaku inflicted further damage on the West Ham rearguard and, sure enough, on 32 minutes, Obiang lost possession in midfield allowing the ball to be fed out to Marcus Rashford on the left-flank.\n\nInstinctively, Lukaku made his rampant run behind Zabaleta, Reid and Ogbonna and, although his 12-yard shot splintered Hart's right-hand upright, the ball simply flew across goal into the opposite corner to leave an Old Trafford crowd - post-Wayne Rooney - saluting their new scoring sensation.\n\nIn reply, Noble sent a 20-yard volley high over De Gea's crossbar before Eric Bailly was booked for dumping Hernandez onto the Manchester turf that he used to call home and, then with referee Martin Atkinson about to blow for half-time, a free-flowing move almost saw the Hammers snatch a shock equaliser but the defiant De Gea beat out Edimilson Fernandes' 15-yarder scorcher after Arnautovic, Ayew and Noble cleverly combined to set up the Swiss international.\n\nHaving survived that late scare, it was business as usual for United after the break as they doubled their lead within just eight minutes of the restart, when Zabaleta was yellow-carded for blocking the escaping Rashford on the right-hand edge of the Hammers area.\n\nAnd the Argentinian paid a heavy price for that foul for, when Mkhitaryan floated over the consequent free-kick, that man Lukaku ghosted in front of Masuaku to nod home his second goal of the afternoon.\n\nYet again, West Ham almost shocked De Gea, when Masuaku floated in a left-wing cross that Arnautovi\u0107 headed over the Spaniard onto the top of the crossbar and, after Antonio Valencia was cautioned for a lunge on the Austrian, Bili\u0107 made a double-switch with Diafra Sakho and young Declan Rice replacing Fernandes and the dejected Noble.\n\nForgotten man Sakho soon sent a header just wide but this was token resistance from the Hammers as Lukaku had a shot charged down by Reid before Mkhitaryan's mazy run was thwarted by Hart's fine low save.\n\nRashford cut in from the left and unleashed a dipping 20-yarder that rebounded off the base of the far upright and back across goal, while Daley Blind sent an angled volley onto the roof of the net and Mkhitaryan had an effort ruled out for offside, too.\n\nMaraoune Fellaini replaced Mata for the final quarter-hour, while Martial came on for Rashford and Aaron Cresswell took over from Masuaku.\n\nBut there there was to be yet more Manchester misery for West Ham in the final three minutes as Mkhitaryan invited Martial to race behind the visitors' defence and calmly slot past the helplessly exposed Hart.\n\nAnd then in the final seconds, Pogba advanced forward from midfield before letting fly with a 20-yarder that both gave United their fourth goal of the afternoon and sent Mourinho's men to the top of the table with 37 matches left to play.\n\nRED DEVILS: De Gea, Valencia, Blind, Bailly, Jones, Mati\u0107, Pogba, Mata (Fellaini 75),

The first came when he ran onto a through-ball following a quick break and slotted a finish in off the post in the 33rd, and the second was a header from a free kick in the 52nd.\n\nMatic, meanwhile, was authoritative on his league debut for United following his recent departure from Chelsea, which looks increasingly like an ill-judged decision from the champions. He created the first goal by dispossessing West Ham's Pedro Obiang and sparking the break, and proved to be an impenetrable shield in front of United's back four.\n\nHe could be one of the signings of the summer at 40 million pounds ($53 million).\n\nAnthony Martial and Paul Pogba scored in the final three minutes of normal time to leave United top of the early standings.\n\nEarlier, Tottenham beat 10-man Newcastle 2-0 away thanks to goals by Dele Alli and Ben Davies, with last season's runner-up only pulling clear at St. James' Park after Jonjo Shelvey's 48th-minute red card.\n\nShelvey was sent off for treading on the foot of Alli, an act that was even more foolish as it took place right in front of the referee.\n\nSpurs are the only team in the Premier League not to make a signing this summer but they are still looking likely title contenders, alongside United.\n\n___\n\nSteve Douglas is at www.twitter.com/sdouglas80\n\nTottenham Hotspur's Ben Davies, centre, celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game with team mates during the Premier League soccer match against Newcastle at St James' Park in Newcastle, England, Sunday Aug. 13, 2017.

United manager in the same way he ended his first by proving his acumen in the transfer market.\n\nThe Reds' Europa League win in Stockholm against Ajax came courtesy of goals from Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\n\nThe near \u00a3120m investment in the Frenchman and the Armenian paid dividends on the night in Sweden last May.\n\nIt finally vindicated the outlay for the pair that had at times during the campaign looked like it had maybe been an expensive folly.\n\nTheir impacts were slow burners.\n\nBut we didn't have to wait so long for Mourinho's window buys 12 months on to fit right into his new Old Trafford jigsaw.\n\nAnd United fans like the look of the final picture that is developing as all the pieces slot into place.\n\nEven allowing for market force there was an element of criticism aimed at United when they paid \u00a375m for Romelu Lukaku from Everton.\n\nAmid the chase for Alvaro Morata, the signing of the Belgian powerhouse was viewed with some scepticism.\n\nThen when Mourinho successfully completed the \u00a335m signing of Nemanja Matic it seemed a dubious import. Surely Chelsea don't sell key players to a rival?\n\nBut Lukaku and Matic had Old Trafford rocking as West Ham were dispatched.\n\nMourinho had previously bigged up the Hammers' summer business claiming that their new faces suggested they were \"playing for the Premier League title.\"\n\nHis team made a mockery of his words.\n\nThere was only one title contender on view at Old Trafford on the opening day.\n\nIt had all started a bit too similar to last season for comfort with United enjoying the bulk of the possession with little to show for it.

As it was, they shouldn't be too greedy. Romelu Lukaku has wasted little time demonstrating why he became the club's most expensive signing over the summer and, on this evidence, it is shaping up to be a season of rich promise for Jose Mourinho's team.\n\nLukaku should certainly have dispelled any lingering self-doubt with the two goals that set up this win. Not that the \u00a375m signing displayed even a flicker of stage fright with the left-foot finish and close-range header with which he introduced himself to the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nLukaku ended a hugely satisfying afternoon waving appreciatively to the Stretford End and he might have finished with the match ball as a souvenir had it not been for a brilliant saving tackle by Pablo Zabaleta, one of three West ham debutants, just after the hour.\n\nYet this was more than just a story of Lukaku's two-goal debut and, though the striker deserves the headlines, the form of Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba should also fill Mourinho with optimism that his team are capable of significant improvement from last season's sixth-placed finish. Potential champions? You wouldn't bet your mortgage against it happening.\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan also had a fine game and, not for the first time, it felt faintly ludicrous that Chelsea have allowed Nemanja Matic to join one of their title rivals. Matic fitted in seamlessly and the home side were not flattered by that late one-two when the substitute Anthony Martial slotted in the third goal, quickly followed by Pogba knocking another in from 20 yards. It was a tepid show from West Ham and they have now lost 11 opening-day games in the Premier League era, more than any other club.\n\nAs the crowd serenaded Mourinho and Joe Hart, West Ham's new goalkeeper, was reminded that it was a long way down since he was winning championships with Manchester City, it did not seem to matter too much that Victor Lindelof, the home team's \u00a331m acquisition from Benfica, was not even in the squad because of an unimpressive pre-season. Another manager might have felt duty-bound to play such an expensive player. Mourinho does not operate with those kinds of constraints and Phil Jones was recalled alongside Eric Bailly to make sure Javier Hern\u00e1ndez did not enjoy his return to Old Trafford too much.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez scored 37 goals in 103 league games during his days in Manchester and one imagines he would have loved the kind of chances that Lukaku's team-mates served up for the Belgian. Mkhitaryan's expertly delivered free-kick for the second goal was the case in point. Rashford's beautifully weighted pass for the first was another. These are the opportunities Lukaku depends upon and, as long as it continues this way, he should get a bagful this season.\n\nRashford was also involved in the second goal, having been chopped down by Zabaleta for the free-kick, and curled another shot against the post before Martial took over for the last 10 minutes. These are early days but Mourinho, slowly but surely, seems to be assembling a side without any obvious weaknesses and Matic's contribution for the first goal was a neat little snapshot of his worth. Matic played with great control and it was his interception, cutting out Pedro Obiang's pass, that sent Rashford haring away to start the move that led to Lukaku firing in the first goals.\n\nWest Ham had defended stoutly until that point but the away team had set about the afternoon with a distinct lack of adventure and there were only fleeting moments when their new-look frontline of Hern\u00e1ndez, Marko Arnautovic and Andr\u00e9 Ayew flickered into life. Arnautovic had their best moment with a looping header that David de Gea tipped over the crossbar but the score was 2-0 at that stage and, for the most part, Slaven Bilic's men were pinned back into their own half.\n\nMkhitaryan's precise pass left Martial with the opportunity to stroke in the third goal and Pogba added the final flourish by beating Hart for the second time in a minute.", "timeCrawl": "17:12:00", "sim": 0.5882353186607361, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8945106", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "id": 14, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Soccer", "id": 262, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

See photo\n\nRomelu Lukaku does it again! As the Premier League begins with Manchester United playing their first match of the season against West Ham, Lukaku scores not one but two brilliant goals to declare himself as one of the best signings by the Old Trafford side this season. With this, Lukaku has now scored on his Premier League debut for three different clubs - West Brom, Everton and now United.\n\nIn the 33rd minute of his first league game under manager Jose Mourinho, the Belgian player found the net by a simple yet smart goal from 10 yards, which was a perfectly timed angled run behind the defence as Marcus Rashford produced a 40-yard run and slipped the ball into the Hammers' penalty area.\n\nThe 24-year old was intent on stealing the entire limelight as twenty minutes later, he headed home his second. It was another straight goal, a downward header into the far corner as he helped the Red Devils with a wonderful start to their league campaign after finishing sixth on the table last season. He flicked a free-kick from Henrikh Mkhitaryan past Joe Hart.\n\nLast week, Lukaku became the only goal scorer for the Red Devils as they went down 2-1 against Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup, which was his proper first game for United, if you take out the pre-season tour and friendlies.\n\nIf Lukaku continues his form, he will surely get United out of the slumber.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App", "timeCrawl": "17:12:00", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-13", "textStart": 32, "amb": false, "textEnd": 47}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8945240", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(Getty Images) Romelu Lukaku enjoyed a dream Premier League debut for Manchester United as the Belgian's brace inspired a 4-0 rout of West Ham, while Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal was the pivotal moment in Tottenham's 2-0 win at Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nUnited manager Jose Mourinho paid a British record \u00a375 million ($96 million, 82 million euros) to sign Lukaku from Everton in the close-season and the 24-year-old needed just 33 minutes to get off the mark for his new club.\n\nAccelerating on Marcus Rashford's pass, Lukaku drilled a powerful strike in off the post to put United ahead in their Premier League opener at Old Trafford.\n\nLukaku was virtually unplayable at times and he doubled United's advantage in the 53rd minute with a bullet header from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's free-kick.\n\nSubstitute Anthony Martial added United's, slotting past Joe Hart in the 87th minute, before Paul Pogba's 90th minute strike sent Mourinho's men to the top of the table above Huddersfield on goal difference.\n\nOnce sold by Mourinho when the pair were at Chelsea together, Lukaku could be the catalyst for a first serious title challenge from United since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.\n\nLukaku wasn't the only impressive United debutant, with Nemanja Matic delivering a solid display that underlined why Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was so miffed his club sanctioned the \u00a340 million sale of the Serbia midfielder to a title rival.\n\nAt St James' Park, Shelvey was sent off early in the second half for deliberately treading on Tottenham star Dele Alli, who was on the ground only yards from referee Andre Marriner.\n\nAlli got his revenge by firing Tottenham ahead in the 61st minute with a cool close-strike from Christian Eriksen's superb lofted pass.\n\nFollowing Tottenham's Danny Rose had ranted about the club's failure to sign quality players during the close-season, it was fitting that the injured left-back's replacement Ben Davies was the man to increase his side's lead in the 70th minute.\n\nAlli, Eriksen and Harry Kane opened up Newcastle with a flowing move before Davies produced a clinical finish.\n\nHaving finishing second last term, Tottenham will hope their winning start bodes well for a sustained bid to dethrone Chelsea.\n\nPochettino's side host the champions next weekend in their first league match at Wembley following their move to the national stadium while White Hart Lane is being redeveloped this season.\n\nBy then, the Argentine would like to have added to his squad after a frustrating transfer window.\n\n\"It was important to start with three points, but it wasn't a great game and wasn't our best performance,\" Pochettino said.\n\n\"The balance of the team is the main thing and we need some new players to bring some new energy.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Rafael Benitez revealed Shelvey apologised to his team-mates for ruining the promoted club's return to the top-flight.\n\n\"The sending off changed everything. He made a mistake,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"Hopefully he will learn from it. He has apologised but that changes nothing now.\"", "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8948645", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "id": 33, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

\u00a375m man pounced to smash in at the near post before a second half header sealed the points\n\nGet Manchester United FC updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nRomelu Lukaku announced himself to Old Trafford with a classy double to down West Ham.\n\nManchester United's new \u00a375m man pounced to smash in at the near post in the first half to open his Premier League account for United.\n\nBefore grabbing a second with a free header from a Henrikh Mkhitaryan corner.\n\nAnthony Martial jumped off the bench to add gloss to the result with a wonderful finish before Paul Pogba's thumping stoppage time fourth.\n\nJose Mourinho's men were denied a third by the off side flag and then the woodwork - as Marcus Rashford was left frustrated.\n\nHere are five talking points from the clash at Old Trafford...\n\n1. Nemanja Matic is the new Roy Keane\n\nMatic might be the best piece of business this summer.\n\nHe quietly did the business alongside N'golo Kante last in Chelsea title winning side, and the Blues letting him walk away to a challenger could be the silliest move of all.\n\nThe Serbian ruled the midfield in the way Keane did around the turn of the century.\n\nHe won the ball for Lukaku's opener but that was just the tip of a very large midfield masterclass in tackling and passing.\n\nMatic might not have the bully pretense of the Irish legend Keane, but their styles aren't too dissimilar.\n\n2. Romelu Lukaku is the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nLast season Ibrahimovic took almost all the goal burden and it looks like Lukaku will be dragging United along this time.\n\nMartial and Pogba hinted the pressure might not all be piled on the big front man this year but even if it is, Lukaku appears to be able to carry the load.\n\nThe Belgian looked quiet in the early stages, looking a little laboured as he prowled the edge of the box.\n\nBut his strikes, his 10th and 11th in 11 appearances against the hapless Hammers livened him up.\n\nLukaku has been uncaged from Everton's mid-table malaise to become a global superstar.\n\nBut for \u00a375m you expect a big return and he looks set to pay his dues.\n\n3. Mourinho Blind to left back\n\nThe left-back position at United has been a head scratcher for a few season.\n\nLuke Shaw and Marcos Rojo have failed to put in consistent performances and while they are both nursing injuries, Daley Blind is slotting in.\n\nMatteo Darmian had been fitted in on the left back in pre-season to a high standard, but Blind could fill the hole nicely.\n\nThe Dutchman refused to put a foot wrong throughout the 90 minutes, as West Ham's plan to target him fell flat on its face.\n\nBut it was going forward where he pulled the Hammers apart, with a second half effort landing on top of the goal.\n\n4. Threadbare Hammers\n\nWest Ham had five defenders on the bench, plus a keeper. That should tell you all you need to know about the depth of Slaven Bilic's squad.\n\nThe Hammers have been concentrating on letting deadwood drift away rather than replacing them this window.\n\nBilic has brought in quality with Javier Hernandez, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta but with not enough below them it could be a soulless year in east London.\n\nWilliam Carvalho could be a suitable signing to add some more class, if they can get him.\n\n5. Big expectations on the Little Pea\n\nThe lack of depth piles on the pressure on Hernandez up front - with little to back him up off the bench or from midfield.\n\nThe former United front man will need to start a goal run soon to put worries at ease of a struggling season, with the fitness of Andy Carroll always in question and Diafra Sakho not up to it.\n\nThe Mexican barely had a sniff in this one but produced a couple of nice touches standing off the defence.\n\nHe is at his best as a goal hanging type, just pouncing on balls in the box, he does need some decent service though.", "timeCrawl": "17:10:00", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8944829", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "id": 140, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email\n\nRomelu Lukaku was a key figure for Manchester United as he netted a double in his side's 4-0 victory over West Ham.\n\nThe new \u00a375million man was a relentless threat and pounced to score the opener with little more than half an hour played.\n\nHe then grabbed a second with a header before Anthony Martial followed suit with an exquisite finish.\n\nIt was an afternoon to forget for Joe Hart as Paul Pogba completed the rout with a thumping fourth in stoppage time.\n\nHere are the Mirror's Alex Smith five talking points from the clash at Old Trafford.\n\n1. Nemanja Matic is the new Roy Keane\n\nMatic might be the best piece of business this summer.\n\nHe quietly did the business alongside N'golo Kante last in Chelsea title winning side, and the Blues letting him walk away to a challenger could be the silliest move of all.\n\nThe Serbian ruled the midfield in the way Keane did around the turn of the century.\n\nHe won the ball for Lukaku's opener but that was just the tip of a very large midfield masterclass in tackling and passing.\n\nMatic might not have the bully pretense of the Irish legend Keane, but their styles aren't too dissimilar.\n\n2. Romelu Lukaku is the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nLast season Ibrahimovic took almost all the goal burden and it looks like Lukaku will be dragging United along this time.\n\nMartial and Pogba hinted the pressure might not all be piled on the big front man this year but even if it is, Lukaku appears to be able to carry the load.\n\nThe Belgian looked quiet in the early stages, looking a little laboured as he prowled the edge of the box.\n\nBut his strikes, his 10th and 11th in 11 appearances against the hapless Hammers livened him up.\n\nLukaku has been uncaged from Everton's mid-table malaise to become a global superstar.\n\nBut for \u00a375m you expect a big return and he looks set to pay his dues.\n\n3. Mourinho Blind to left back\n\nThe left-back position at United has been a head scratcher for a few season.\n\nLuke Shaw and Marcos Rojo have failed to put in consistent performances and while they are both nursing injuries, Daley Blind is slotting in.\n\nMatteo Darmian had been fitted in on the left back in pre-season to a high standard, but Blind could fill the hole nicely.\n\nThe Dutchman refused to put a foot wrong throughout the 90 minutes, as West Ham's plan to target him fell flat on its face.\n\nBut it was going forward where he pulled the Hammers apart, with a second half effort landing on top of the goal.\n\n4. Threadbare Hammers\n\nWest Ham had five defenders on the bench, plus a keeper. That should tell you all you need to know about the depth of Slaven Bilic's squad.\n\nThe Hammers have been concentrating on letting deadwood drift away rather than replacing them this window.\n\nBilic has brought in quality with Javier Hernandez, Joe Hart and Pablo Zabaleta but with not enough below them it could be a soulless year in east London.\n\nWilliam Carvalho could be a suitable signing to add some more class, if they can get him.\n\n5. Big expectations on the Little Pea\n\nThe lack of depth piles on the pressure on Hernandez up front - with little to back him up off the bench or from midfield.\n\nThe former United front man will need to start a goal run soon to put worries at ease of a struggling season, with the fitness of Andy Carroll always in question and Diafra Sakho not up to it.\n\nThe Mexican barely had a sniff in this one but produced a couple of nice touches standing off the defence.\n\nHe is at his best as a goal hanging type, just pouncing on balls in the box, he does need some decent service though.", "timeCrawl": "17:29:00", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8947345", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations_and_Age_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Generations and Age Groups", "id": 116, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Record signing Romelu Lukaku led the United attack while a former Old Trafford favourite in Javier Hernandez featured for the Hammers.\n\nHere, Press Association Sport looks at how the two players fared.\n\nCHANCES\n\nLukaku had a quiet start but confidence oozed from him and there seemed no stopping him after opening the scoring. His movement was excellent and the opportunities soon started to come with regularity. He could easily have had a hat-trick. By contrast, Hernandez was starved of decent service throughout and will be hoping West Ham get a lot better than this.\n\nFINISHING\n\nLukaku took his first two chances with aplomb. He smashed home his first goal off the post and then powerfully headed his second after taking up a good position. He was denied a hat-trick by a brilliant block from Pablo Zabaleta and was wasteful only with one effort that flew over the bar. Hernandez simply struggled to get into the game and was not a threat in front of goal.\n\nLINK-UP PLAY\n\nUnited's set-up played to Lukaku's strengths and he slotted into the system well. He had quiet periods but he took up good positions off the ball and held up play to bring others into the game when necessary. Hernandez began to come into the game more in the second half by dropping deep to take up possession. It was to little avail, however, as West Ham never threatened to get back into the contest.\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION\n\nThese are early days but the signs are already positive for Lukaku and United. Different teams will present different challenges but the way Lukaku has slotted in and looked a threat from the off suggests he could enjoy a very fruitful United career. Hernandez will have to write this day off.

An outstanding domestic debut. 8\n\nPaul Pogba\n\nDid not allow the absence of a third midfielder to hamper him. Produced crowdpleasing moments and scored superbly. 8\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan\n\nLinked up well with United's forwards and played Juan Mata through for their first real opening. Provided a great cross for Lukaku's second. 7\n\nJuan Mata\n\nHis creativity enhanced United's attack even if it was at the expense of width. Mata's movement troubled West Ham throughout. 7\n\nMarcus Rashford\n\nWas toiling until he latched onto Matic's block and decisively passed for Lukaku. Finished wastefully early in the second-half but unlucky to hit post. 6\n\nRomelu Lukaku\n\nFinished emphatically to break the deadlock. His mobility was a welcome addition to a forward line which was occasionally hampered by the static Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 8\n\nSubs\n\nMarouane Fellaini Shored things up. 6\n\nAnthony Martial Brilliant cameo. 8\n\nJesse Lingard Not enough time to make an impact.

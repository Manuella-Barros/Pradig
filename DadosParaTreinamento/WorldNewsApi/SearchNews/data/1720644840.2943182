Pace-heavy Babar Azam-led side is expected to feature four pacers \u2013 Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf \u2013 against arch-rivals India on the tricky wicket of Nassau County International Cricket Stadium, New York on Sunday. The pitch has behaved abruptly in the first two matches of the tournament with awkward bounce and dual pace keeping batters at bay on the drop-in surface. Keeping the pitch factor in mind, Ishant said it will be interesting to see Indian batters facing Pakistan\u2019s pace arsenal. \u201cThe India-Pakistan match is the pinnacle of excitement in cricket. The intense rivalry brings out the best in both teams. I\u2019m eager to see how India tackles Pakistan\u2019s formidable bowling attack on this challenging pitch,\u201d he said. The veteran Indian pacer added that a trio of all-rounders Axar Patel, Shivam Dube, and Hardik Pandya will play a key role in the encounter. \u201cOur strategy will heavily rely on the versatility of all-rounders like Axar Patel, Shivam Dube, and Hardik Pandya. Remember the heart-stopping Super Over in 2007? We might be in for another nail-biter. This match isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s a battle of strategies and nerves, and I\u2019m excited to see it unfold,\u201d Ishant said.

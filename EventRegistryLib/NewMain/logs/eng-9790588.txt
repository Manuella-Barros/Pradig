No country or nation has anything to gain from escalation in the Middle East,\" the G7 ministers said in a statement after the conversation.\n\nThe commander of the US Army's Central Command, General Michael Korilla, arrived in in Israel on Monday to finalize coordination with the IDF in preparation for the possible attack by Iran and Hezbollah, senior Israeli officials said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting on Sunday night with Defense Minister Gallant and the heads of the military and the intelligence community to discuss the impending attack by Iran and Hezbollah and the possible Israeli response, senior Israeli officials said.\"Iran and its agents are looking to surround us with a stranglehold of terror. We are determined to stand up to them on every front and in every arena - near and far. Whoever seeks to harm us will pay a very heavy price,\" Netanyahu said yesterday.American Defense Minister Lloyd Austin spoke on Monday with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. He reiterated the firm support of the United States for Israel's security and its right to self-defense against the threats from Iran, Lebanon, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terrorist organizations supported by Iran. They discussed the reinforcement of American forces, which they said are needed to protect US personnel, support the defense of Israel, and deter and reduce tensions in the region.\n\nAustin also expressed his firm support for a ceasefire in Gaza and a deal to release the hostages.\n\nThe regional picture\n\nOther countries in the region are also preparing for a dramatic escalation and are making efforts to try and prevent it.Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi made a rare visit to Tehran on Sunday - the first such visit by a Jordanian foreign minister in almost a decade.Jordan is very worried about an Iranian missile and drone attack that would be expected to pass through its airspace.During the attack on April 13, Jordan intercepted Iranian drones that were making their way towards Israel and allowed American and Israeli fighter jets to use its airspace to intercept Iranian drones and cruise missiles.Safadi met with the acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri and conveyed him a message from King Abdullah II to the President of Iran, according to a statement from the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"I came to express concern about the escalation in the region. I did not come here to convey a message from Israel or to receive a message from Israel,\" Safdi said after his meeting in Tehran.\n\nSeveral Iranian officials vowed that the country would avenge Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh's assassination, as Israel remains on high alert for a potential attack and the United States is sending additional forces to the region.\n\nIran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Saturday that revenge would be \"severe and at an appropriate time, place, and manner,\" blaming the \"terrorist Zionist regime\" for Haniyeh's death.", "source": {"uri":

He noted that the U.S. is trying to limit the strike and then ease any potential Israeli response.\n\nThe American diplomat expressed frustration that the escalation of the Middle East conflict is affecting ceasefire negotiations in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBlinken stated that before Haniyeh's killing, the U.S. administration felt that the parties were closer to reaching an agreement than ever before.\n\nEarlier, the State Department reported that Blinken discussed urgent measures with G7 foreign ministers to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East.", "source": {"uri": "en.trend.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "International News Agency Trend"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baku"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politburo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://en.trend.az/imagen/3930671", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790588", "eventUri": "eng-9790588", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 18, "textEnd": 26}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Iran and Hezbollah have pledged to retaliate for the killing of the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah last week.\n\nQuoting three unnamed sources, Axios reports that Blinken told G7 counterparts in a conference call that Iran and Hezbollah could launch an attack against Israel as early as Monday.\n\n\"The sources said Blinken stressed that the US believes Iran and Hezbollah will both retaliate,\" Axios wrote, adding that Washington \"doesn't know the exact timing of the attacks\" or what form they would take.\n\nBlinken told his G7 counterpart that the United States hopes to halt the escalation by persuading Iran and Hezbollah to limit their attacks and restrain any Israeli response. He asked the other foreign ministers to join that push by applying diplomatic pressure on the trio.\n\nThe G7, which also includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, issued a statement on Monday expressing \"deep concern over the heightened level of tension in the Middle East\", and called for restraint on all sides, insisting that \"no country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation\".\n\nImmediately following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 31, the US sent additional military forces to the Middle East in anticipation of retaliatory attacks. It insists that the deployment is \"defensive\".\n\nUS Central Command chief, General Michael Kurilla, is reportedly set to arrive in Israel on Monday to \"finalise preparations\" with the Israeli army \"ahead of the possible attack\", Axios reports.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant issued a warning, saying: \"If they dare to attack us, they will pay a heavy price.\"\n\nThe nearly 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas has led to regular low-level hostilities between Israel and Iran and Hezbollah, as well as other groups in the region that are aligned with Tehran.\n\nIt is widely thought that neither side is ready for an all-out war, but the heightened tensions mean the risk of a conflagration is high.\n\nThe list of countries advising citizens to immediately leave Lebanon continued to grow on Monday, following warnings from the US and many European governments.\n\nJapan, Saudi Arabia and France are among the latest to urge their citizens to leave the country while commercial flights are still operating.\n\n\"In a highly volatile security context\", the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs \"urgently asked\" its nationals to avoid travelling to Lebanon and suggested those already in the country leave \"as soon as possible\".", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors":

However, unlike the April 13 Iranian attack, which involved nearly 350 drones and missiles intercepted by Israel, the US, and their allies, Blinken noted the form of the upcoming retaliation remains unclear.\n\nBlinken indicated that the exact timing of the attacks is unknown but could start within the next 24-48 hours. He stressed the US is working to de-escalate the situation by limiting Iranian and Hezbollah attacks and restraining the Israeli response.\n\nThe Secretary urged the G7 foreign ministers to apply diplomatic pressure on Iran, Hezbollah, and Israel to exercise maximum restraint. He mentioned that the US was \"close to a breakthrough\" before the Tehran assassination, and now a deal is more crucial than ever.\n\nGen. Michael Kurilla, the commander of US Central Command, is expected to arrive in Israel on Monday to finalize preparations with the Israeli forces for the possible attack, according to Israeli officials.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting on Sunday night with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and military and intelligence leaders. \"Iran and its agents are looking to surround us in a stranglehold of terrorism. We are determined to stand against them on every front and in every arena -- near and far. Whoever seeks to harm us will pay a very heavy price,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nGallant also spoke with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday, who reiterated the \"firm support of the United States for Israel's security and its right to self-defense.\"\n\nOther regional countries are bracing for escalation. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Al-Safadi visited Tehran on Sunday for the first time in almost a decade.\n\nAl-Safadi met with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri and conveyed a message from King Abdullah II to the Iranian president. \"I didn't come here to convey a message from Israel or to receive a message for Israel. I came here to express concern about regional escalation,\" Safadi said.\n\nSeveral Iranian officials have vowed to avenge Haniyeh's assassination, while Israel remains on high alert for a potential

However, he emphasized that it could start as soon as the next 24 to 48 hours, meaning as soon as Monday.\n\nWashington was attempting to \"break the escalatory cycle\" by limiting the attacks by Iran and its proxies and also by restraining Israel's response to them, said Blinken according to Axios.\n\n\"Blinken asked the other foreign ministers to apply diplomatic pressure on Iran, Hezbollah and Israel to maintain maximum restraint,\" the report continued.\n\nHe also stressed to the G7 allies that the bolstering of U.S. forces in the Middle East region was for defensive purposes only.\n\n\"We express our deep concern over the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region,\" the G7 ministers said in a statement.\n\n\"We urge all involved parties to refrain from perpetuating the current destructive cycle of retaliatory violence, to lower tensions and engage constructively towards de-escalation. No country or nation stands to gain from further escalation in the Middle East,\" it continues.\n\nGen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), arrived in the Middle East on Saturday for a previously planned trip the focus of which has now shifted to mobilizing a multilateral defensive force to shield Israel.\n\nKurilla was expected in Israel on Monday. Israeli officials told Axios that Kurilla will meet with the Israel Defense Forces to finalize preparations ahead of the possible Iranian and Hezbollah attacks. He was also scheduled to visit the Gulf states and Jordan.\n\nBiden to convene national security team\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to convene his national security team in the situation room on Monday to discuss the developments in the Middle East, according to the White House.\n\nThe president will also speak with Jordan's King Abdullah, the White House said. Amman played a pivotal role during Iran's April 13 onslaught on Israel.\n\nJordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi visited Tehran on Sunday to discuss the security situation. According to the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, Safadi met with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri and passed along a message from King Abdullah II to the Iranian president.\n\n\"I didn't come here to convey a message from Israel or to receive a message for Israel. I came here to express concern about regional escalation,\" Axios quoted Safadi as saying after his meeting in Tehran.\n\nUnderscoring the regional tensions, the visit marks the first diplomatic trip to the Islamic Republic by a high-level Jordanian official since Safadi's predecessor, Nasser Judeh, led a government delegation to Tehran in 2015.\n\nIranian officials have told Arab diplomats that Tehran is determined to strike Israel even if doing so sparks a regional war, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened the chiefs of Israel's security agencies on Sunday evening for a situation assessment at the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Channel 12 News reported, noting that the government is still creating a \"definitive picture\" of the assault it could be facing.\n\nThe report said that Israel's defense establishment was considering the possibility of \"preventive actions or attacks ... in Lebanon or perhaps in other places where necessary.\"\n\nA source in Jerusalem told NBC News earlier on Sunday that the government is bracing for a combined attack by Iran and Hezbollah lasting \"several days,\" with missile attacks from the north and east.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His bodyguard was also killed in the attack.\n\nThe US announced Friday that it will deploy additional fighter jets and navy warships to the Middle East.\n\nHezbollah is also expected to retaliate after Israel assassinated Shukr in an airstrike on a southern suburb of Beirut on July 30.\n\nThe escalation comes amid an ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza which has killed nearly 39,600 people following Hamas's Oct. 7 attack last year that killed 1,200 Israelis.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2024/08/05/thumbs_b_c_a1643c73f7e31ea77af528d3cd9b717c.jpg?v=073545", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790588", "eventUri": "eng-9790588", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2266, "textEnd": 2273}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2395, "textEnd": 2401}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

U.S. is expecting Iran and Hezbollah's imminent retaliation on Israel to come as early as Monday, they are unsure exactly how or what the retaliation will look like, the sources told the

In response, the U.S. is enhancing defensive measures and urging diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and U.S. General Michael Kurilla are preparing for potential conflict, while the G7 calls for restraint to avoid a larger regional war.Secretary of State Antony Blinken has alerted G7 foreign ministers that an attack by Iran and Hezbollah on Israel could begin as soon as Monday, as told to Axios by three sources in the know. This warning follows the recent assassinations of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and Hezbollah military commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Blinken's call aimed to coordinate with U.S. allies and exert diplomatic pressure to mitigate the potential retaliatory strikes by Iran and Hezbollah.\n\nDiplomatic and Defensive Measures\n\nBlinken stressed that limiting the impact of these anticipated attacks is crucial to prevent a full-scale war. He stated that while the exact timing of the retaliation is unclear, it could start within the next 24-48 hours. The U.S. is boosting its defensive forces in the region, though Blinken clarified that this reinforcement is purely defensive. He urged G7 foreign ministers to apply diplomatic pressure on Iran, Hezbollah, and Israel to maintain maximum restraint.\n\nRegional Preparations\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and military and intelligence leaders on Sunday night. Netanyahu emphasized, \"Iran and its minions are looking to surround us in a stranglehold of terrorism. We are determined to stand against them on every front and in every arena -- near and far. Whoever seeks to harm us will pay a very heavy price.\" The Israeli government is preparing for possible attacks and has strengthened its defense mechanisms accordingly.\n\nJust a day earlier, General Michael Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Monday to finalize defense preparations with the Israeli Defense Forces. His visit underscores the heightened state of readiness and the need for coordinated defense efforts.\n\nRegional and International Reactions\n\nIn response to the escalating situation, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi visited Tehran on Sunday, marking the first such visit in nearly a decade. Safadi met with acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri and conveyed concerns about regional escalation. Jordan intercepted Iranian drones during a previous attack and has allowed U.S. and Israeli fighter jets to use its airspace for interceptions. Safadi stated, \"I didn't come here to convey a message from Israel or to receive a message for Israel. I came here to express concern about regional escalation.\"\n\nThe G7 foreign ministers expressed deep concern over the rising tensions in the Middle East. In a statement, they urged all parties to avoid further retaliation and engage constructively toward de-escalation. \"We express our deep concern over the heightened level of tension in the Middle East which threatens to ignite a broader conflict in the region,\" the G7 ministers said. They added, \"No country or nation stands to gain from further escalation in the Middle East.\"\n\nThis heightened tension follows Israel's recent actions against key figures in Hamas and Hezbollah. The U.S. is working to prevent a repeat of the April 13 attack when Iran launched nearly 350 drones and missiles toward Israel, which were largely intercepted by U.S. and Israeli forces.

The warning comes in the wake of recent assassinations of key figures in Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with a phone call between Blinken and G7 ministers, the U.S. believes that both Iran and Hezbollah may launch attacks on Israel \"as early as Monday.\" The exact nature of these potential retaliations remains unclear. Earlier Blinken has talked to his GCC counterparts for de-escalation efforts.

Blinken reportedly stressed that while the exact timing and nature of any attacks are unknown, both Iran and Hezbollah are expected to retaliate.\n\nThe G7, comprising Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the UK, issued a statement expressing deep concern over the escalating tensions and calling for restraint from all parties involved.\n\nIn response to the heightened threat, the US has deployed additional military forces to the Middle East, describing the move as defensive. US Central Command chief General Michael Kurilla is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Monday to finalize preparations with the Israeli military.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant warned of severe consequences should an attack occur. The ongoing Gaza conflict has already led to intermittent hostilities between Israel and Iranian-backed groups, raising concerns about a full-scale war.\n\nAs tensions rise, several countries, including Japan, Saudi Arabia, and France, have advised their citizens to leave Lebanon immediately due to the volatile security situation.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9247.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790588", "eventUri": "eng-9790588", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He added that the US doesn't know the exact timing of the attacks but stressed it could start as early as the next 24-48 hours, the sources said.\n\nBlinken also told the G7 nations that the US was trying to break the escalatory cycle by trying to limit the attacks by Iran and Hezbollah as much as possible and then restrain the Israeli response. He also urged the countries to apply diplomatic pressure on Iran, Hezbollah and Israel to maintain maximum restraint. He also added that bolstering the US presence in the area was aimed at defensive purposes.\n\nHowever, the diplomatic efforts don't seem to have the desired effect as reports claim Iran reportedly told foreign ministers from Jordan and Lebanon that it didn't care if the 'response triggered a war.'\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal report, foreign ministers from Jordan and Lebanon travelled to Iran to placate the leadership in Tehran but they informed them that it was set on retribution and \"didn't care if the response triggered a war.\"\n\nIsrael too is preparing for the possibility of an Iranian-led attack that would include missiles being fired at Israel over multiple days, Western media reports quoted Israel officials. Though Israel does not have a \"definitive picture\" of the attacks it will be facing, the government is considering launching a preemptive strike to deter Iran if it uncovered airtight evidence that Tehran was preparing to mount an attack.\n\nHowever, for Israel to launch a pre-emptive attack it would require its own intelligence on the issue to match up with US intelligence on the matter. Even then, it may choose not to go down that route.\n\nLike the April 13 attack, the first attack ever carried out by Iran on Israeli soil, Israel will be able to stand it.

In both cases, Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah blamed Israel.\n\nIsrael does not know what to expect from Iran and its allies and is therefore considering a wide range of options on how best to respond to or prevent an attack, local media reported.\n\nDuring the meeting with Netanyahu, the possibility of launching a preemptive strike against Iran was discussed, Ynet wrote, although security officials stressed that such an action could only be given the \"green light\" if Israel received clear information confirming that Tehran is preparing to attack.\n\nJerusalem would have to verify with its own information that it receives from American agencies, but even in this case it might not ultimately choose to strike first, reports the relevant publication.\n\nBlinken Sees an Attack by Iran and Hezbollah Today or Tomorrow\n\nIn the meantime, new concern for the situation in the Middle East is caused by the assessment that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reportedly expressed to his G7 colleagues that Iran and Hezbollah may launch their attack on Israel within the next 24-48 hours.\n\nIn the same conference call, according to three sources cited by Axios, Blinken added that it remains unknown how Iran and Hezbollah will be struck.\n\nThe American Foreign Minister also told his counterparts that the US is making efforts to break the cycle of escalation by trying on the one hand to limit as much as possible the strikes against Israel and on the other hand to contain Tel Aviv's response.\n\nOne of the sources also said Blinken was furious at the collapse of the latest Gaza ceasefire talks, saying Washington had a feeling a deal was close before Haniya's assassination in Tehran.\n\nThe Group of 7 Calls for De-escalation\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) most developed industrialized countries today called for restraint and de-escalation in the Middle East, underlining that recent events \"threaten to ignite a wider conflict in the region\".\n\nThe G7 calls in its statement \"once again for all parties involved not to continue the destructive cycle of retaliatory violence, to reduce tensions and engage constructively on the path of de-escalation.\"", "source":

They do not help to follow the path of justice, the path of peace, but generate even more hatred and revenge,\" the head of state of the Vatican said.\n\nHowever, Iran's foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday that it is not seeking to escalate regional tensions but still believes Israel needs to be punished to prevent further instability.\n\nAccording to Israeli media, an underground bunker in Jerusalem, prepared by Israel's Shin Bet security service, is said to be fully operational and can accommodate senior leaders - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - for an extended period during wartime.\n\nConcerns that the nearly 10-month war on Gaza could become a wider regional conflict have increased after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut last week.\n\nIn Gaza, over 39,000 people have been killed because of indiscriminate Israeli bombardment and ground attacks on the territory.", "source": {"uri":

pressure mounted Monday to avoid an escalation between Iran and Israel following high-profile killings that have sent regional tensions soaring, while numerous governments urged their citizens to leave Lebanon.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Sunday that his country was \"determined to stand against\" Iran and its allied armed groups \"on all fronts.\"\n\nAs its war against Iran-backed Hamas in Gaza nears its 11th month, Israel has been bracing for retaliation from the Tehran-aligned \"axis of resistance\" for the assassinations of two senior figures.\n\nPalestinian armed group Hamas's political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran on Wednesday, in an attack blamed on Israel which has not directly commented on it, hours after an Israeli strike on Beirut left Hezbollah military chief Fuad Shukr dead.\n\nTehran said Monday that \"no one has the right to doubt Iran's legal right to punish the Zionist regime\" for Haniyeh's killing.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from the G7 nations in a conference call on Sunday that any attack, which he expected to be a joint undertaking between Hezbollah and Iran, could happen within 24 to 48 hours, as early as Monday, US news site Axios reported.\n\nBlinken asked his counterparts to place diplomatic pressure on Tehran, Hezbollah and Israel to \"maintain maximum restraint,\" it added.\n\nThe United Nations' rights chief Volker Turk called on \"all parties, along with those states with influence, to act urgently to de-escalate what has become a very precarious situation.\"\n\nIsrael's military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Sunday night that \"as of now there is no change\" in its policy for protecting civilians.",

For the residents of southern Lebanon, the atmosphere is no doubt considerably more fearful and uncertain, living as they do in a failed state dominated by Hezbollah that may soon feel the full weight of Israeli fury.\n\nAt such a time, the temptation, not altogether misplaced, is to focus on personalities: Ayatollah Ali Khameini, the aged follower of the maker of Iran's revolution; Yahiya Sinwar, the diabolical mastermind of the October 7 massacre; Hassan Nasrallah, the charismatic Hezbollah leader infuriated by the recent loss of his chief military aide, Fuad Shukr, to an Israeli strike; and above all Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, untrusted and untrustworthy, politically skilled but no statesman, intelligent but not wise, a former commando who shuns responsibility and is loathed by many, including, according to Israeli newspapers, his own generals.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that some, in Israel and abroad, regard the recent attacks that eliminated Shukr in Beirut and the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran -- in a Revolutionary Guard Corps guesthouse, no less -- as one more piece of folly by Netanyahu, who has mortgaged his country's politics to religious extremists and who, many believe, is animated solely by a desire to survive in power as long as possible.\n\nThere may be truth in all this, but only a part of the truth, and probably not the most important truth. A more detached strategic analysis yields a different picture.\n\nBegin with the nature of the larger Middle East war, which has been going on for years now but chiefly in the shadows, or at least without a lot of Western-media attention, which amounts to the same thing. The war is an existential conflict between Israel and a coalition of its enemies, at the center of which is Iran. The various militant groups sponsored by Iran -- Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, militias in Syria and Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen -- share the elimination of the Jewish state as their strategic goal. They may agree to truces, but those are pauses, not armistices, much less peace.\n\nThis conflict has persisted since the creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, with pulses of greater and lesser violence. It is the reason Iran has steadily equipped Hezbollah with a large armory of rockets and missiles, and why it is now doing the same for the Houthis; it is why its militias in Syria and Iraq conduct attacks on Israel and on American forces; it is why ships are attacked and sometimes sunk, not only in the Arabian Gulf but also on other seas.\n\nIran funds and supports this coalition, even if it does not entirely control it. Hamas, an outgrowth of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, is not its creation. Hezbollah has become the brilliant pupil that is now, in some respects, the equal of its teacher in military skill and capacity. The Houthis may not respond to command. But a coalition it is, and with it, Iran has built a ring of fire around Israel.\n\nIsrael, too, stands in the midst of a coalition, a rather more powerful one. The United States, of course, is its ally; quietly, some of the key European states, Britain and France above all, lend their measured support. Strikingly, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and even Saudi Arabia have given Israel the use of their airspace and helped in the remarkable defense of Israel in April against salvos of drones and missiles from Iran.\n\nThe October 7 assault triggered this particularly desperate round of fighting -- the shock of the massacre and Israeli unpreparedness, the engagement of Hezbollah in a war that has depopulated a significant part of the Galilee, and the consequent destruction of much of Gaza in the Israeli counteroffensive.\n\nFor Israeli strategists, the assassinations of Shukr and Haniyeh were part of a campaign aimed at two things: the restoration of Israel's deterrent reputation, and the rebuilding of battered Israeli morale. The losses inflicted on Hezbollah and Hamas -- the Israelis have been systematically attacking the senior ranks of both organizations -- undoubtedly make them less effective. But the broader Israeli purpose is also reputational: to make its enemies believe that its intelligence agents are everywhere, that its armed forces are lethally accurate, and that Jerusalem can find them and kill them wherever they are.\n\nThese operations are also aimed at the home front, and before one criticizes the Israelis too severely for that, one should recall the Doolittle Raid against Japan in April 1942. The United States threw away 16 scarce B-25 bombers and some of their crews in a one-way mission to retaliate against Japan for Pearl Harbor. The military effects were negligible, although hundreds of Japanese were killed or wounded, including civilians. But it helped restore American morale and shake Tokyo. Nor is the assassination of senior enemy leaders a game only the Israelis play, as the widows of Osama bin Laden and Qassem Soleimani know.\n\nThe Israeli attacks, in other words, are best seen not as a ploy by Netanyahu but as a considered Israeli move, supported by its national-security establishment. And if the attacks present the threat of a larger and more lethal war, every senior Israeli figure I know believes that one is coming anyway. For many years, Israel has waged limited wars intended to contain threats; an old term, hachra'ah, or \"decision,\" has notably come back into use in Israeli military literature.\n\nIf the Israelis find themselves facing difficult choices, so do their enemies. Hamas probably expected Hezbollah to join its attacks on October 7. It eventually did, but initially on a modest scale, giving the Israelis time to recover their balance. Hezbollah may not have wanted a larger war that would end with the devastation of its Shi'a base in southern Lebanon but felt that it had to participate at some level. And Iran finds itself in the unenviable position of promising a devastating attack against an Israel that is fully prepared to defend itself and respond to it. Nor have the Iranians lost only the advantage of surprise. Hezbollah has been of use to them as a drain on the Israelis and for the threat of devastation its arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles poses. A bigger war, which would lead to an Israeli invasion of Lebanon even more violent and destructive than its incursion into Gaza, would deprive Iran of its chief ally and assistant, and its most potent threat against Israel.\n\nBut Iran cannot sit idly by either. Its strategic culture values humiliation, something alien to Western military thought, yet it has been humiliated by the Haniyeh assassination. The delay between the blow received and the blow it will deliver has allowed the United States and Israel's other friends to prepare to parry it. If it throws another failed punch, as in the April missile barrage, things will be even worse. It too finds itself, in other words, in a strategic trap of its own making.\n\nCarl von Clausewitz famously described war as consisting of a \"peculiar trinity\" of three elements: raw animosity and hatred, the rational application of military means for political ends, and a creative element involving the design and use of violence. All three elements are present here. The hatred is real, furious, and for the time unassuageable on both sides; the rational purposes are discernible. The real question is how creative each side will be in the war that looms -- and also, as Clausewitz would have acknowledged, how lucky.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eliot_a_cohen@theatlantic.com", "name": "Eliot A.

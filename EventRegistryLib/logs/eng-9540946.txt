Wolfe, who is working on a book about the \"Disney Adults\" phenomenon, said online \"side hustles\" related to Disney World are becoming more common.\n\nSome of the people who have posted about working inside Disney World also offer travel-planning services to other Disney fans.

A series of movie flops, culture war kerfuffle, and the stubborn unprofitability of direct-to-consumer streaming, however, soon soured investors on Disney stock. Opening below $115 Monday, Disney shares are down nearly 40% from their peak -- but there's good news, too.\n\nLoop Capital analyst Alan Gould just predicted Disney stock will return to $140 a share within a year, and return to a price last seen two years ago.\n\nIs Disney stock a buy?\n\nWhat makes Gould optimistic? As the analyst explains on StreetInsider.com, losses at Disney+ are moderating already. And Disney is cracking down on password sharing to grow revenue, bringing it \"closer to breakeven.\" Consumers are more confident, too, which could bring new business to Disney's parks.\n\nBest of all, Gould notes that Disney's going to start buying back shares.\n\nIn fact, Disney has announced $3 billion in share buybacks. And the company's generating $8 billion a year in positive free cash flow today, so it has plenty of cash with which to do that. My bigger concern is whether buying Disney stock is the right move...for Disney, and also for investors.\n\nHere's the problem as I see it: First and foremost, Disney stock is not cheap. Even down 40% in three years, the stock trades for 26 times trailing free cash flow. Adjusted for debt, Disney's valuation rises to 31 times FCF.\n\nThese are not cheap valuations for a stock that grew revenue less than 1% last quarter, and that's probably going to grow free cash flow in the low-teens the next couple of years. Meanwhile, Disney's more pressing problem is its $40 billion in net debt. If Disney wants to make itself a more attractive investment, that's the problem it should tackle first of all.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $544,015!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Disney has missed revenue estimates from analysts in three of the last five quarters.\n\nAnalysts expect Disney to report second-quarter earnings per share of $1.10, compared to 93 cents per share reported in last year's second quarter. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates from analysts in four of the last five quarters, with the other quarter coming in-line with estimates.\n\nGuidance from the company calls for full-year earnings per share of $4.60, which would amount to a 20% year-over-year improvement.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: A growth-focused approach from Disney CEO Bob Iger was praised by Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich in an early April note.\n\n\"Bob Iger now appears to be in command and control and on a growth offensive,\" Ehrlich said.\n\nThe analyst, who has a Buy rating, raised the price target from $130 to $145 at the time.\n\nEhrlich said Disney's theme park sector is showing strong performance. A carriage deal with Charter could provide a boost to net subscriber growth for Disney+ in the second quarter, the analyst said.\n\nThe analyst predicts Disney will add 7.5 million new Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nHere are other recent analyst ratings for Disney ahead of the second-quarter earnings report.\n\nRelated Link: EXCLUSIVE: Streaming Platform Winner Picked By Benzinga Readers: Did Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video Or Max Take Top Honors?\n\nKey Items to Watch: One of the key items to watch in the second quarter results is the Disney+ subscription figures.\n\nDisney reported 111.3 million Disney+ Core subscribers at the end of the first quarter, which was down 1% quarter-over-quarter. The company's guidance calls for adding six million Disney+ Core subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nSubscribers could be added thanks to the carriage deal with Charter, but also due to some new content in the quarter.\n\nDisney landed the rights to the record-breaking Taylor Swift concert film. Released on March 14 on Disney+, \"The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)\" may have brought new subscribers or returning subscribers to the platform in the quarter.\n\nA report from Deadline said 4.6 million people watched the film in its first three days of streaming on Disney+.\n\nAnother potential hit for Disney in the second quarter was newly released episodes of the hit show \"Bluey.\" The show debuted on Disney+ in 2020 and has become one of the most-watched shows in the U.S. New episodes from the third season joined Disney+ in January. Data from Nielsen shows \"Bluey\" as the most streamed show in the U.S. in 2024 based on viewing time.\n\nThe success of \"Bluey\" could continue into the third quarter, with the longest episode in series history \"The Sign\" hitting Disney+ on April 14. The episode had 10.4 million views globally in its first week.\n\nThe success of Disney+ and its popular releases may offset Disney's disappointing box office performance this year, with no films in the top 10 for the first four months of 2024.\n\nDisney does have future blockbusters \"Inside Out 2\" and \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" being released in theaters in June and July, respectfully.\n\nInvestors and analysts will also be tracking cost cuts by Disney and its continued plans to right size the company.\n\n\"We are on track to meet or exceed our $7.5 billion annualized savings target by the end of fiscal 2024, while we continue to look for further efficiency opportunities,\" Disney said in its first-quarter earnings report.\n\nDIS Price Action: Disney shares are up 2.5% to $116.58 on Monday, versus a 52-week trading range of $78.73 to $123.74.

Genie+\n\nWaiting in line at Disney might feel like a rite of passage, but it doesn't need to be. Genie+ is a paid add-on service that lets you bypass most of the line at some attractions. I use the extra time saved with Genie+ to try attractions that tend to have fewer lines. I'm looking at you, Enchanted Tiki Room.\n\nGenie+ prices vary by day, park and demand. Expect to pay at least $30 per person per day at Disneyland and at least $15 to $20 per person per day at Disney World. Though a family of four could easily spend more than $100 on line-skipping privileges on busy days, it can be worth it -- particularly if you're on a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Time is money, and you don't want to spend all of it waiting in line.\n\nLine-skipping access looks to be increasingly relevant as crowds continue to grow. According to The Walt Disney Co.'s earnings report for the quarter ending in December 2023, Disneyland saw year-over-year attendance growth versus the quarter ending in December 2022.\n\nAnd attendance is only expected to increase, especially as Disney continues to add rides or update themes. For instance, Tiana's Bayou Adventure is scheduled to open in Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World and Disneyland Park in California in 2024.\n\n2. A stay at a Disney-owned resort\n\nDisney-owned hotels have benefits that other, nearby -- off-property -- hotels can't offer. That includes closer proximity to the theme parks in most cases. For example, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa and Pixar Place Hotel have their own entrance to Disney California Adventure Park.\n\nDisney also ranks among the rare resort-area chains that don't charge resort fees.\n\nBut perhaps the most important reason to book a stay at a Disney-owned resort? Early theme park entry. Hotel guests who hold a valid theme park ticket for that day can enter the parks 30 minutes before everyone else.\n\nIn Florida, early entry is offered at all four Walt Disney World theme parks every day. In California, the benefit alternates between Disneyland or Disney California Adventure (depending on the day).\n\nGetting to the park at opening time is critical for jumping on the most popular attractions before the lines back up. The ability to enter 30 minutes before the official opening time gives you an additional leg up.\n\nAlthough Disney resorts tend to be more expensive than off-property hotels, you can find some deals. According to Disney price tracking site Touring Plans, nightly rates for Disney's All-Star resorts start at $133 (though they can run over $300 during peak season).\n\n3. A character meal\n\nMy family and I nabbed a photo with Mickey, Minnie and Pluto during breakfast at Storytellers Cafe at Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. Prices start at $52 per person, but it enables you to meet characters without a theme park ticket -- and without waiting in line.\n\nIf you plan to stand in line to meet Disney characters, there's a way to meet them without the line.\n\nSure, you'll pay at least $50 for the privilege, but at least it comes with food. At a Character Dining restaurant, a handful of costumed characters mosey around the dining area while you eat. Since they make a point to stop at every table, you won't even have to wait in line; they come to you.\n\nAnd with no line, the whole experience tends to be a lot more relaxed. Diners can spend more time with each character than the usual \"love and shove\" encounter that happens when there's an hourlong wait to meet Mickey Mouse.\n\nThere are four Character Dining restaurants in California and about a dozen in Florida. Meal prices vary, but some of the most popular can run more than $100 per person. Note that for restaurants inside the theme parks, you'll need a ticket, too.\n\nFor example, dinner at Cinderella's Royal Table in the Magic Kingdom Park starts at $84 per adult before tax, tip and optional beverage add-ons. But the princess dining option lets you meet multiple royal ladies in one go.\n\nConsider that not far away, you can meet Cinderella and one other princess for no additional cost (other than a park entry ticket) at Princess Fairytale Hall, but wait times tend to run from 30 to 90 minutes.\n\nIn contrast, the meal at Cinderella Castle tends to entail a meet-and-greet with four princesses. Plus, you get the unique experience of dining inside the iconic Disney landmark.\n\nNot all meals are that expensive. At Cape May Cafe, in Disney's Beach Club Resort near Epcot, you can have breakfast with Minnie Mouse and some of her friends clad in beach attire.\n\nFor $47 per adult (before tax and tip), you can meet Disney characters and nosh on all-you-can-eat salted caramel \"beach buns,\" Mickey-shaped waffles, omelets, biscuits, gravy and more. And since that restaurant is in one of the Disney World hotels, you won't need a theme park ticket.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(Disney)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genie (Disney)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disneyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Parks,_Experiences_and_Products", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney Parks, Experiences and Products"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney's_Grand_Californian_Hotel_&_Spa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney's_Enchanted_Tiki_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney's Enchanted Tiki Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_California_Adventure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney California Adventure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anaheim, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiana's_Bayou_Adventure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiana's Bayou Adventure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mickey Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney's_Beach_Club_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney's Beach Club Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pluto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epcot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasyland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantasyland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Waffle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/X3TBHWKIT5BSDJ7TJY77D3DDMI.jpg?auth=e8c2463cb3219f406ba3bc5915731adabaf68d73ffdc5396114fbd29262a4039&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540946", "eventUri": "eng-9540946", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

A series of movie flops, culture war kerfuffle, and the stubborn unprofitability of direct-to-consumer streaming, however, soon soured investors on Disney stock. Opening below $115 Monday, Disney shares are down nearly 40% from their peak -- but there's good news, too.\n\nLoop Capital analyst Alan Gould just predicted Disney stock will return to $140 a share within a year, and return to a price last seen two years ago.\n\nWhat makes Gould optimistic? As the analyst explains on StreetInsider.com, losses at Disney+ are moderating already. And Disney is cracking down on password sharing to grow revenue, bringing it \"closer to breakeven.\" Consumers are more confident, too, which could bring new business to Disney's parks.\n\nBest of all, Gould notes that Disney's going to start buying back shares.\n\nIn fact, Disney has announced $3 billion in share buybacks. And the company's generating $8 billion a year in positive free cash flow today, so it has plenty of cash with which to do that. My bigger concern is whether buying Disney stock is the right move...for Disney, and also for investors.\n\nHere's the problem as I see it: First and foremost, Disney stock is not cheap. Even down 40% in three years, the stock trades for 26 times trailing free cash flow. Adjusted for debt, Disney's valuation rises to 31 times FCF.\n\nThese are not cheap valuations for a stock that grew revenue less than 1% last quarter, and that's probably going to grow free cash flow in the low-teens the next couple of years. Meanwhile, Disney's more pressing problem is its $40 billion in net debt. If Disney wants to make itself a more attractive investment, that's the problem it should tackle first of all.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

Aside from factors like travel fare-which depends on where you live-there's a lot to consider when making this decision. Here are some key takeaways about Walt Disney World vs. Disneyland.\n\nPrices for both parks will vary depending on the duration of your trip, the time of year you book, or even the day of the week you visit. It's good to be aware of this dynamic pricing, as it's constantly changing and can affect how much you spend on your park visit. No matter how you slice it, at either location, you can expect to pay more than $100 per ticket for just the basic price of admission.\n\nMany prefer Disney World as it offers such amenities as park hopper tickets which allow you to bounce around parks, and better hours, as those staying at the property resorts can benefit from extended hours for additional park time.\n\nUltimately though, this is a personal and family choice. Some allures of Disneyland may trump those of Disneyworld. For instance, although Phil Gramlich, owner of Ear To There Travel, an EarMarked Authorized Disney Travel Planning Agency and the host of the Disney-focused podcast Turkey Leg Talk (formerly the Ear To There Disney Podcast), thinks Disney World offers the bigger bang for your buck, he prefers Disneyland.\n\n\"Disneyland Park is honestly my favorite park in existence due to the fact that I'm a huge Walt Disney fan/expert and you can literally walk where he walked there and touch what he touched,\" Gramlich said. \"But please use hand sanitizer after all that touching.\"\n\nWhether you're dreaming of meeting Mickey Mouse in Florida or strolling down Main Street, USA in California, you can easily make some magical memories at either of the happiest places on earth. Here are some factors to consider to help you decide which is the better fit for you and your family.\n\nBoth Walt Disney World and Disneyland offer magical experiences that will create memories to last a lifetime. If you're looking for sheer size and variety, Walt Disney World may be the way to go. However, if you prefer a more compact and intimate experience, Disneyland could be the perfect choice.

Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) reports its fiscal second-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday.\n\nExpectations may not seem lofty, but the shares are already trading 26% higher this year. Disney is trouncing the market after three consecutive years of falling short. It can't afford to squander its long-absent bullish momentum. The media giant needs a strong performance to keep the upticks coming. Let's take a closer look at this critical week for Disney shareholders.\n\nDisney isn't likely to match the excitement it generated last time out. Its fiscal first-quarter performance in early February came with a bag of goodies, but it didn't have the option of coming to the party empty-handed. With a proxy battle ready to go down at its April shareholder meeting, it was Disney's last chance to impress retail and institutional investors to avert an activist shakeup of its boardroom.\n\nAs a refresher, here is just a taste of some of the pixie dust that Disney sprinkled on the market three months ago:\n\nSome of these announcements were logical reveals in its last quarterly earnings call. The Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour release on Disney+ was happening a month later. The Epic Games purchase had just been finalized. However, why would it announce a dividend hike five months before it's actually going out? The buyback with Disney shares approaching fresh 52-week highs could've waited. Disney wanted to sling as many Brave arrows as it could ahead of its annual meeting showdown. Is there anything left in its quiver this time around?\n\nAnalysts see $22.14 billion in revenue for the three months ending in March, a mere 1.5% increase over the past year. The lackluster growth makes sense given Disney's rough year-over-year comparisons at the box office. The release of Avatar: The Way of Water in late December 2022 was still wooing audiences in the fiscal second quarter of last year. Disney's promising slate of potential box office blockbusters this year doesn't get rolling until Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes debuts this weekend. Disney World in Florida was also wrapping up its celebration of the resort turning 50 in last year's fiscal second quarter.\n\nThe real story here will be the bottom line. Wall Street pros are holding out for an adjusted profit of $1.10 a share, a figure that has been inching higher in the days leading up to tomorrow's report. This would translate into an 18% increase. Recent history suggests Disney could do even better. The entertainment stock bellwether isn't just exceeding bottom-line targets in its three previous outings. The degree of the beat is accelerating.\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. EPS = earnings per share.\n\nAs Disney+ grows closer to its goal of turning profitable in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and Disney makes headway in its other cost controls the story keeps getting better on the bottom line. Disney might not seem cheap at 24 times this fiscal year's earnings, but if analysts are still aiming low the real multiple will be even more attractive.\n\nThe market will forgive a flat top line this quarter. It's all about the bottom line. A little insight into CEO Bob Iger's succession strategy and its theme park plans also can't hurt at this point.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

A series of movie flops, culture war kerfuffle, and the stubborn unprofitability of direct-to-consumer streaming, however, soon soured investors on Disney stock. Opening below $115 Monday, Disney shares are down nearly 40% from their peak -- but there's good news, too.\n\nLoop Capital analyst Alan Gould just predicted Disney stock will return to $140 a share within a year, and return to a price last seen two years ago.\n\nWhat makes Gould optimistic? As the analyst explains on StreetInsider.com, losses at Disney+ are moderating already. And Disney is cracking down on password sharing to grow revenue, bringing it \"closer to breakeven.\" Consumers are more confident, too, which could bring new business to Disney's parks.\n\nBest of all, Gould notes that Disney's going to start buying back shares.\n\nIn fact, Disney has announced $3 billion in share buybacks. And the company's generating $8 billion a year in positive free cash flow today, so it has plenty of cash with which to do that. My bigger concern is whether buying Disney stock is the right move...for Disney, and also for investors.\n\nHere's the problem as I see it: First and foremost, Disney stock is not cheap. Even down 40% in three years, the stock trades for 26 times trailing free cash flow. Adjusted for debt, Disney's valuation rises to 31 times FCF.\n\nThese are not cheap valuations for a stock that grew revenue less than 1% last quarter, and that's probably going to grow free cash flow in the low-teens the next couple of years. Meanwhile, Disney's more pressing problem is its $40 billion in net debt.

Walt Disney (DIS 1.53%) reports its fiscal second-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday.\n\nExpectations may not seem lofty, but the shares are already trading 26% higher this year. Disney is trouncing the market after three consecutive years of falling short. It can't afford to squander its long-absent bullish momentum. The media giant needs a strong performance to keep the upticks coming. Let's take a closer look at this critical week for Disney shareholders.\n\nDisney isn't likely to match the excitement it generated last time out. Its fiscal first-quarter performance in early February came with a bag of goodies, but it didn't have the option of coming to the party empty-handed. With a proxy battle ready to go down at its April shareholder meeting, it was Disney's last chance to impress retail and institutional investors to avert an activist shakeup of its boardroom.\n\nAs a refresher, here is just a taste of some of the pixie dust that Disney sprinkled on the market three months ago:\n\nSome of these announcements were logical reveals in its last quarterly earnings call. The Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour release on Disney+ was happening a month later. The Epic Games purchase had just been finalized. However, why would it announce a dividend hike five months before it's actually going out? The buyback with Disney shares approaching fresh 52-week highs could've waited. Disney wanted to sling as many Brave arrows as it could ahead of its annual meeting showdown. Is there anything left in its quiver this time around?\n\nAnalysts see $22.14 billion in revenue for the three months ending in March, a mere 1.5% increase over the past year. The lackluster growth makes sense given Disney's rough year-over-year comparisons at the box office. The release of Avatar: The Way of Water in late December 2022 was still wooing audiences in the fiscal second quarter of last year. Disney's promising slate of potential box office blockbusters this year doesn't get rolling until Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes debuts this weekend. Disney World in Florida was also wrapping up its celebration of the resort turning 50 in last year's fiscal second quarter.\n\nThe real story here will be the bottom line. Wall Street pros are holding out for an adjusted profit of $1.10 a share, a figure that has been inching higher in the days leading up to tomorrow's report. This would translate into an 18% increase. Recent history suggests Disney could do even better. The entertainment stock bellwether isn't just exceeding bottom-line targets in its three previous outings. The degree of the beat is accelerating.\n\nData source: Yahoo! Finance. EPS = earnings per share.\n\nAs Disney+ grows closer to its goal of turning profitable in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year and Disney makes headway in its other cost controls the story keeps getting better on the bottom line. Disney might not seem cheap at 24 times this fiscal year's earnings, but if analysts are still aiming low the real multiple will be even more attractive.\n\nThe market will forgive a flat top line this quarter. It's all about the bottom line. A little insight into CEO Bob Iger's succession strategy and its theme park plans also can't hurt at this point.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_munarriz@fool.com", "name": "Rick Munarriz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_call", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earnings call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

But a recent turnaround plan from CEO Bob Iger has investors more bullish in recent months.\n\nHere's how Wall Street expects Disney to perform, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg:\n\nDisney's stock has been on a tear since the start of the year, up about 30% compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% rise over that same time period.\n\nThe bullish sentiment has been driven by improved financials along with a slew of fresh announcements the company revealed in February -- just ahead of its proxy fight win.\n\nAt the time, Disney disclosed a dividend boost and new share repurchase program in addition to confirming it's on track to meet or exceed its $7.5 billion annualized savings target by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\nThe company also announced a $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games and doubled down on sports streaming with the reveal of an upcoming joint venture partnership with Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. Disney is also working on a separate sports streaming platform for ESPN, set to debut in fall 2025.\n\n\"Sentiment has improved, but we do not see much change in the financial outlook, with the biggest question on ESPN OTT still ahead,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients ahead of the results.\n\nRelated to sports, Disney has reportedly agreed to increase its media rights deal with the NBA to $2.6 billion, up from the previous $1.5 billion. The NBA's current rights deal expires at the end of next season.\n\n\"I don't know that [Disney has] a lot left in its pocket for this earnings report,\" Doug Creutz, managing director at TD Cowen, told Yahoo Finance. \"I think numbers will be fine, but I don't think you'll see nearly as much 'new news' as we did three months ago.\"\n\nThe company is expected to see a boost in subscriber additions as Charter cable subscribers begin to receive complimentary Disney+ subscriptions as part of their packages.\n\nDisney said it expects to add 5.5 million to 6 million core Disney+ users in the second quarter while Wall Street is more cautious with a consensus estimate just under 5 million, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe company also expects continued positive momentum in average revenue per user, or ARPU, amid recent price hikes and a crackdown on password sharing, which should show more \"notable benefits\" in the second half of the year.\n\nDisney expects its streaming business to be profitable by the fourth quarter.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Ron DeSantis, and a very public proxy battle for control of the ailing media behemoth (which incumbent CEO Bob Iger won), Disney has unveiled its first step in trying to set up a more successful 2024 and beyond.\n\nIt came in a piece by The Hollywood Reporter that focused on Disney Experiences chairman Josh D'Amaro, and D'Amaro's grand and costly plans.\n\n\"The executive is tasked with harnessing that demand into an even bigger growth engine for the company, as he leads Disney's $60 billion investment in its parks and experiences division over the next 10 years,\" THR noted.\n\nThe article cited the potential of Disney's parks and cruise lines, as well as \"more than 1,000 acres of land available for development across the company's six resorts.\"\n\nWith D'Amaro being touted as a strong candidate to succeed Iger, his ability to stretch that $60 billion investment will be under intense scrutiny.\n\nIn fairness to D'Amaro, the raw numbers do appear to support the idea that he's a gleaming hope in an otherwise morose landscape.\n\n\"D'Amaro's division, which also includes consumer products and totals about 180,000 employees, has driven profits for the company each quarter, reaching an all-time revenue record in the first quarter of 2024,\" THR reported. \"Income for the segment reached $8.9 billion in 2023, up 23 percent from the previous year, and up from $6.8 billion in 2019.\"\n\nInterestingly, the report also noted that D'Amaro's \"high-return-on-investment unit\" is being leaned on as Disney+ \"pushes for profitability\" -- meaning the streaming platform isn't profitable for the House of Mouse.\n\nGiven the investments made into that platform, that's a concerning sign for Disney, to say the least.\n\nThe $60 billion will be split roughly 70/30, with 70 percent of that budget going towards new rides and experiences at the theme parks, and 30 percent earmarked for tech, infrastructure and maintenance, The Hollywood Reported noted.\n\nImprovements and investments are expected across both domestic and international Disney theme parks.\n\nThe domestic parks could certainly use some aid.\n\nDisneyland is situated in the inhospitably expensive Anaheim, California, which will be an ongoing issue for the SoCal landmark.\n\nDisney World in Orlando, Florida, however, is facing a much more present issue.\n\nChief theme park rival Universal Studios unveiled its new \"Epic Universe\" theme park in February, with more impressive details trickling out since.\n\nThat monstrous new theme park will boast five themed areas that will look to directly challenge the dominance of the Magic Kingdom.\n\nAnd that's all to say nothing about whatever issues Disney is grappling with abroad.\n\nBy any measurement, $60 billion is a lot of money, and it looks to be Disney's first genuine step towards fixing things.\n\nWill it work?

What to watch:\n\nSTREAMING: In Q1, Disney reported results that CEO Robert Iger said \"demonstrates we have turned the corner and entered a new era for our company.\"\n\nIger added: \"Looking at the renewed strength of all of our businesses this quarter - from Sports, to Entertainment, to Experiences - we believe the stage is now set for significant growth and success, including ample opportunity to increase shareholder returns as our earnings and free cash flow continue to grow.\"\n\nWith its last quarterly update, Disney reported Disney+ Core paid subscribers of 111.3M, Disney+ Hotstar paid subscribers of 38.3M and total Hulu subscribers of 49.7M as of December 30, 2023. Disney said it expects Disney+ Core subscriber net additions of between 5.5M-6M and \"ongoing positive momentum in ARPU\" in the second quarter.\n\nIn addition, Disney raised its dividend 50% to 45c per share and said it plans to target $3B in share repurchases in fiscal 2024.\n\nDisney also said: \"Based on the strength of first quarter results as well as our expectations for the balance of the year, we expect full year fiscal 2024 earnings per share excluding certain items to increase by at least 20% versus 2023, to approximately $4.60. Further, we continue to expect free cash flow generation in fiscal 2024 to total roughly $8B. We continue to expect to reach profitability at our combined streaming businesses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, and are making tremendous progress in this area, with first quarter Entertainment DTC operating losses improving by nearly $300M versus the prior quarter. We believe this business will ultimately be a key earnings growth driver for the company.\"\n\nTHE MAGIC IS BACK: On day after Disney's last report, February 8, Needham upgraded Disney to Buy from Hold with a $120 price target based on expectations for \"strong\" 23% FY24 EPS growth, driven by additional cost savings, direct-to-consumer streaming breakeven by Q4 with \"double-digit\" margins at maturity and 5.5M-6M new subs from Charter (CHTR) in fiscal Q2. The firm also cited the ESPN Sports joint venture with Fox and Warner, the $1.5B investment in Epic Games, Parks capex devoted to \"incremental capacity,\" the exclusive Taylor Swift concert rights on Disney+, a 50% higher dividend and greater than $3B of share repurchases in 2024 in contending that \"The Magic's Back.\"\n\nOn March 25, Barclays upgraded Disney to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $135, up from $95. Disney's \"narrative reset\" is likely to be followed by positive estimate revisions, which should further support the stock's valuation, the analyst told investors. The firm said the \"incessant Disney-related news flow\" ahead of the proxy vote had dominated investor considerations and this process and announcements, including better than expected free cash flow and earnings guidance for fiscal 2024, had helped investors gain more confidence about Disney's earnings estimates having bottomed. The firm believes there may still be some sources of \"upside narrative surprises\" such as ESPN's streaming partnerships, Barclays added at the time of its note.\n\nDISNEY WINS BOARD FIGHT: On April 3, Disney said \"it appears that Disney's full slate of 12 directors has been elected by a substantial margin over the nominees of Trian and Blackwells at Disney's 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\" Bob Iger said in response: \"I want to thank our shareholders for their trust and confidence in our Board and management. With the distracting proxy contest now behind us, we're eager to focus 100% of our attention on our most important priorities: growth and value creation for our shareholders and creative excellence for our consumers.\"\n\nTrian, meanwhile, stated: \"While we are disappointed with the outcome of this proxy contest, Trian greatly appreciates all of the support and dialogue we have had with Disney stakeholders. We are proud of the impact we have had in refocusing this company on value creation and good governance. Since we re-engaged with the company in late 2023, Disney has announced a host of new operating initiatives and capital improvement plans. The Board has been refreshed with two new directors. Over the last six months, Disney's stock is up approximately 50% and is the Dow Jones Industrial Average's best performer year-to-date... And, we wish the best for all of the company's stakeholders, including Disney's Board and management team. We will be watching the company's performance and be focusing on its continued success.\"\n\nSPORTS STREAMING VENTURE: In February, ESPN, a subsidiary of Disney, Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) reported that they have reached an understanding on principal terms to form a new joint venture to build a new platform to house \"a compelling streaming sports service.\" The formation of the pay service is subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements amongst the parties. The offering, scheduled to launch in the fall of 2024, would be made available directly to consumers via a new app.\n\nFollowing that news, FuboTV (FUBO) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the trio and their affiliates, alleging that the vertically-integrated media companies have engaged in a years-long campaign to block Fubo's sports-first streaming business resulting in significant harm to both Fubo and consumers. The complaint alleges that the forthcoming launch of a sports-streaming joint venture \"steals Fubo's playbook and is the latest example of this campaign.\"\n\nIn March, Pete Distad, who previously worked at Apple (AAPL) and was responsible for the business, operations and global distribution for Video, Sports and Apple TV+, was named CEO of the new sports streaming service joint venture formed by Disney's ESPN, Fox and Warner, Fox announced. Distad, who most recently served as an executive at Apple for a decade following six years at Hulu, will assume oversight of all aspects of the joint venture, including overall strategy, distribution, marketing, sales and more, Fox stated.\n\nHULU: In late March, Disney added Hulu to Disney+ after beta testing the integration since December 2023. Disney+ subscribers who don't pay for Hulu can still search for Hulu shows, The Hollywood Reporter's Alex Weprin noted in a recap of the move.\n\nOn May 6, Anirban Sen and Dawn Chmielewski of Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that Disney and Comcast (CMCSA) are in talks to hire a financial adviser to resolve a dispute over how to value the 33% stake in Hulu that Disney will acquire from Comcast. JPMorgan has valued Hulu for Disney at close to $27.5B, which is the floor valuation for Hulu that the companies had set as part of their 2019 \"put-call\" agreement, one of the sources said, while Morgan Stanley valued Hulu for Comcast at more than $40B, another source said, according to Reuters.\n\nCONSENSUS: In terms of overall results for the fiscal second quarter, analysts are calling for Disney to report total revenue of $22.12B. The consensus Q1 earnings forecast stands at $1.10 per share, according to Refinitiv. For the June-end quarter, analysts' consensus currently calls for revenue of $23.31B and for the \"House of Mouse\" to post a profit of $1.27 per share, according to data from Refinitiv.", "source": {"uri": "thefly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "thefly.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Iger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-consumer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Direct-to-consumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+_Hotstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+ Hotstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_valuation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock valuation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Music Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Trying to compete in the job market these days isn't an easy feat, and even when you do land a role it might not fit with your 'dream' idea. So, taking some time out to do something fun for a short period is often a great option. Some people choose to do internships, volunteering, or go travelling, before settling down in a long-term role.\n\nAny Mickey and Minnie fans could spend their entire summer in Orlando, Florida, in the heart of the Walt Disney World Resort - experiencing the Disney Magic first-hand. The resort has launched a Cultural Exchange Program for students studying in the UK and Ireland to spend their summer break in America - and applications are now open.\n\nSuccessful applicants will have the opportunity to interact with guests from around the world and learn business philosophies. Job roles are in the following sectors: lifeguarding and custodial, quick service/full-service food and beverage, attractions and operations, and merchandising.\n\nPay is expected to be $16 per hour (approximately \u00a312.72) and staff in the program will work a minimum of 32 hours per week. The program lasts from June to August 2025. Plus, participants will be allowed to remain in the US for tourism for 30 days after completing the program.\n\nYummy Jobs, who are advertising the role, said: \"Imagine the excitement of working, learning and living at the Walt Disney World\u00ae Resort near Orlando, Florida, USA! With the Disney International Programs, you can do just that! Participants on the Disney International Programs experience the magic of Disney whilst interacting with Guests, learning important business philosophies and making friends from all over the world.\n\n\"Not only that, living in the heart of Orlando for the summer provides endless opportunities for Cultural Exchange; program participants get to enjoy all the perks of Disney as a guest, and truly experience the magic first-hand!\"\n\nWant big news with big heart? Get the top headlines sent straight to your inbox with our Daily Newsletter\n\nParticipants on the Disney International Programs live in the brand new Flamingo Crossings Village - fully furnished apartments with fitness centres, swimming pools, computer rooms, and convenient transportation systems. Housing costs are automatically deducted from a participants pay check - costing between $202 to $246 per week (approximately \u00a3160 to \u00a3195).\n\nHowever, Yummy Jobs noted that the program is very popular. On Facebook, a spokesperson for the company added: \"We expect a very high level on interest in this exciting opportunity so we strongly recommend you submit your application promptly.\"\n\nTo be considered, applications must provide proof that they are studying on their CV - including course and level of study, start and end date of course, and name of University currently attending. Eligible candidates will be contacted for a pre-screen interview via Zoom, and people who are successful from there will be invited for in-person interviews in autumn of this year in London or Scotland.\n\nApplications are now open and will close on June 14 of this year at 5pm.\n\nWould you like to work at Disney World?

The resort will be opening a new land, breaking out a brand new parade, an ambitious new nighttime spectacular, a new Summer tribute store, and more.

Unfortunately, the series wasn't made available on Disney+ in many countries due to licensing issues.\n\nThe show is set at the dawn of the 20th century when Indiana Jones discovered the world. From globetrotting family expeditions as a 9-year-old to the battlefields of World War I as a teenager, Indy's experiences shaped the heroic, whip-cracking archaeologist he would become. At every turn, Indy encounters history in the making, meeting true-life activists, soldiers, writers, artists, and thinkers who helped influence the world we live in today.\n\nOver the weekend, the show was removed from Disney+ in the United States. Unfortunately, unlike other streaming services, Disney+ doesn't inform subscribers in advance if any titles are going to be removed.\n\nWhile Disney owns Indiana Jones following its purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012, Paramount still has the distribution rights to the four original films. The deal to get access to the \"Indiana Jones\" movies was a non-exclusive deal, resulting in the films remaining on Paramount+ in many countries.\n\nThe four other \"Indiana Jones\" films are still available on Disney+, but with the series removed, it's possible the classic films will be removed. So if you haven't seen them yet or are in the middle of watching them, I'd suggest doing so soon, as it's possible they could be removed. Hopefully, Disney was able to get a longer licensing deal for those classic films. And maybe one day, \"The Adventures Of Young Indiana Jones\" could return to Disney+ if Paramount is willing to extend or make a new deal.\n\nSince \"Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\" was created and distributed by Disney, that movie will remain on Disney+ regardless of the other movies.\n\nWhat do you think of Disney+ removing the \"The Adventures Of Young Indiana Jones\" series?

They are death for a corporation.\n\nThe reason for this is obvious: Rasmussen discovered that 71 percent want Disney to cease grooming small children.\n\nIn an exclusive to Breitbart News, Rasmussen Reports polled 1,255 adults between April 21-23, and found only terrible news for what was, only a few years ago, one of the most universally-beloved brands in American history.\n\nThis is not the first poll to show Disney's brand cratering. This exclusive Rasmussen poll does, though, confirm previous polls and shows that the Degenerate Disney brand is still in free-fall. For example...\n\nAccording to a Public Strategies poll taken in early 2021 -- when Disney was still Disney, a company dedicated to protecting the innocence of small children and not attempting to \"queer\" them using drag queens, gay sex, transvestites, and transsexuals -- Disney enjoyed a +56 favorability rating (77 percent favorable/21 percent unfavorable). That's exactly where a company wants to sit.\n\nFlash-forward to May of 2022 -- months after Disney launched a crusade to prey on your children's innocence with drag queens, gay sex, transvestites, and transsexuals -- and an NBC poll showed that Disney's net favorability rating had collapsed by an astounding 53 points -- from a +56 to just +3.\n\nIn these divisive times, a politician with a +3 favorable rating is doing pretty well. A corporation with those kinds of numbers is a different story, especially a worldwide entertainment brand like Disney. Corporations that wish to survive cannot be polarizing. But Demonic Disney is so desperate to sexualize little kids, it's willing to take the hit.\n\nAnd now, according to Rasmussen, Disney's favorability rating has collapsed further to a deadly +1.\n\nThe internals are fascinating... Disney is upside-down with Hispanic adults. Only 46 percent view the Grooming Syndicate favorably, while 49 percent view the company unfavorably. Disney is -3 with Hispanics.\n\nThe true divide is political.\n\nSixty-three percent of Democrats view Disney favorably, while 25 percent view the company unfavorably, or +38.\n\nMeanwhile, only 33 percent of Republicans view the child predators favorably, while 61 percent view the child predators unfavorably, or -28.\n\nOther than with Democrats and young people, Disney's favorability rating doesn't climb over 50 with any demographic.\n\nFavorably/Unfavorable\n\nThe reason for these terrible numbers is obvious... Rasmussen asked the following question... \"A Disney executive said the company has 'many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories.' Is such programming appropriate for children under 12?\"\n\nNaturally, a majority of 54 percent said no, while only 33 percent said yes. Respectively, 57 and 58 percent of black and Hispanic respondents said no.\n\nRasmussen then asked, \"Do you agree or disagree with this statement: 'Disney should return to wholesome programming and allow parents to decide when their children are taught about sexuality?'\"\n\nGet this... A vast majority of 71 percent agree, while only 22 percent disagree.\n\nOnce upon a time, the Disney brand meant innocence and universal themes about family, loyalty, duty, and decency. Once upon a time, the Disney brand meant wonderment, adventure, and escapism.\n\nToday, the Disney brand is a threat to small children and destroys every icon (Indiana Jones, Luke Skywalker) it touches. Today, Disney means divisive lectures, scolding, left-wing propaganda, gay sex, boring characters, and even more boring stories.\n\nDisney has turned evil, and evil can only tear down.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_nolte@breitbart.com", "name": "John Nolte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transvestism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transvestism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmussen_Reports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rasmussen Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transsexual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crusades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escapism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/07/Disney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540946", "eventUri": "eng-9540946", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "dateEnd": "2024-04-23", "textStart": 476, "textEnd": 487}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Disney has missed revenue estimates from analysts in three of the last five quarters.\n\nAnalysts expect Disney to report second-quarter earnings per share of $1.10, compared to 93 cents per share reported in last year's second quarter. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates from analysts in four of the last five quarters, with the other quarter coming in-line with estimates.\n\nGuidance from the company calls for full-year earnings per share of $4.60, which would amount to a 20% year-over-year improvement.\n\nWhat Analysts Are Saying: A growth-focused approach from Disney CEO Bob Iger was praised by Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich in an early April note.\n\n\"Bob Iger now appears to be in command and control and on a growth offensive,\" Ehrlich said.\n\nThe analyst, who has a Buy rating, raised the price target from $130 to $145 at the time.\n\nEhrlich said Disney's theme park sector is showing strong performance. A carriage deal with Charter could provide a boost to net subscriber growth for Disney+ in the second quarter, the analyst said.\n\nThe analyst predicts Disney will add 7.5 million new Disney+ subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nHere are other recent analyst ratings for Disney ahead of the second-quarter earnings report.\n\nKey Items to Watch: One of the key items to watch in the second quarter results is the Disney+ subscription figures.\n\nDisney reported 111.3 million Disney+ Core subscribers at the end of the first quarter, which was down 1% quarter-over-quarter. The company's guidance calls for adding six million Disney+ Core subscribers in the second quarter.\n\nSubscribers could be added thanks to the carriage deal with Charter, but also due to some new content in the quarter.\n\nDisney landed the rights to the record-breaking Taylor Swift concert film. Released on March 14 on Disney+, \"The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)\" may have brought new subscribers or returning subscribers to the platform in the quarter.\n\nA report from Deadline said 4.6 million people watched the film in its first three days of streaming on Disney+.\n\nAnother potential hit for Disney in the second quarter was newly released episodes of the hit show \"Bluey.\" The show debuted on Disney+ in 2020 and has become one of the most-watched shows in the U.S. New episodes from the third season joined Disney+ in January. Data from Nielsen shows \"Bluey\" as the most streamed show in the U.S. in 2024 based on viewing time.\n\nThe success of \"Bluey\" could continue into the third quarter, with the longest episode in series history \"The Sign\" hitting Disney+ on April 14.

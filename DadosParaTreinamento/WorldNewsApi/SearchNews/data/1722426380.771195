The sunny season can often trigger intense cravings for those trying to kick the habit, leading to potential setbacks. To combat this, specialists from E-liquids.com have shared their top strategies to resist the temptation to smoke during the balmy months. From leisurely walks to healthy snacking, these tips aim to support individuals on their journey towards a smoke-free existence. Vinod Kumar, the head of digital marketing at E-liquids, commented: \"Summer evenings spent savouring the warm weather in a lively beer garden can make a cigarette incredibly tempting. Fortunately, there are a few straightforward summer tips to help you uphold your commitment to staying smoke-free. \"For those aiming to enhance their health and increase their energy levels this summer, quitting smoking is an excellent initial step towards a healthier lifestyle. Giving up smoking also brings several health benefits that will undoubtedly improve your summer quality. Notably, smoking is known to worsen hay fever symptoms, so quitting could be the solution to becoming symptom-free. \"If you're struggling to quit smoking, considering alternative smoking cessation methods like vaping could also be beneficial. Vaping provides nicotine without many of the harmful toxins found in cigarettes and mimics the act of smoking, easing withdrawal symptoms. \"Alternatively, nicotine replacement therapies such as patches or gum can help reduce cravings, supporting your commitment to becoming smoke-free.\" Below are five great tips to steer clear of smoking urges this summer: Sip on a cool glass of iced green tea: Green tea is well-known for its many health benefits. The antioxidants and amino acids found in green tea can reduce the desire to smoke and may also help repair tissues damaged by smoking. Green tea is rich in L-theanine, an amino acid that is famous for its calming properties. Unlike other calming agents, L-theanine does not cause drowsiness, making it perfect for alleviating the stress commonly felt after giving up nicotine. It effectively manages strong nicotine cravings that occur while quitting. Indulging in a rejuvenating glass of chilled green tea is a pleasant method to alleviate nicotine cravings while remaining refreshed and maintaining good health this summer. Treat yourself to tasty summer fruits: Healthy snacks are a great tool in managing smoking temptations. Replacing cigarettes with nutritious summer fruits like apples, strawberries, and blueberries can help keep your mouth busy and distract you from reaching for a cigarette. Summer fruits are delicious, but other foods can also be useful in combatting the urge to smoke - vegetable sticks such as carrots, celery, and cucumbers are great to chew on when the urge strikes. Studies suggest that those who eat more fruits and vegetables are more likely to quit smoking. In fact, a study by public health researchers at the University at Buffalo found that those who ate the most fruits and vegetables were three times more likely to stay smoke-free for at least thirty days. Keep active with summer walks: Exercise is a strong weapon in combating the urge to light up a cigarette. Regular physical activity not only diverts the mind but also strengthens the body, making it more resilient to cravings. One study discovered that the adverse effects of nicotine withdrawal symptoms quickly diminished during exercise and remained low for up to 50 minutes afterwards. Summer walks, hikes, runs, and other outdoor pursuits can serve as the ideal distraction and substitute the habit of smoking with healthier alternatives. Moreover, exercise can be a powerful motivator to remain smoke-free as your improved fitness will provide a reason to want to maintain a smoke-free lifestyle. Engage in meditation and stress-relieving activities: Activities such as park yoga or sunlit tai chi are perfect summer pastimes to encourage relaxation and mental well-being. Incorporating meditation into your daily routine is an excellent way to sustain the calm and focused mind required to quit cigarettes. Meditative breathing exercises can also significantly reduce stress, enhance mindfulness, and improve self-control - which are all crucial factors in overcoming cravings. Avoid situations or social groups that encourage bad habits: Swerving situations with smoking triggers can be crucial, especially in the early stages of quitting. What's more, alcohol can significantly increase the likelihood of smoking by lowering inhibitions and acting as a social trigger. Therefore, choosing alcohol-free alternatives can be a simple way to help reduce the temptation to relapse. Additionally, socialising with smokers increases the chances of smoking temptations - research indicates that it is most tempting to smoke when around those that are smoking, especially if they offer to share a cigarette with you. Because of these factors, communicating with friends and family to gain their support in your smoke-free journey is crucial. By doing so, your support network will know to help you quit rather than accidentally tempt you back into old habits.", "summary": "Putting a stop to your smoking addiction can save you money, improve your health and extend your life", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/health/beat-nicotine-cravings-little-known-29441134", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29440994.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1150117020.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:00", "author": "Andrew Nuttall", "authors": ["Andrew Nuttall"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.636}

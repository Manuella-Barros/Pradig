He shouldn't stop there, either.\n\nFor Pro Football Focus and ESPN, Khan and the Steelers should make one more offseason addition to the roster, though the two media outlets differ on what that move should be.\n\nFor PFF, adding another receiver is the move the Steelers and Khan must make before training camp, while a cornerback should be in the cards, at least from ESPN's vantage point.\n\nAdding Miller was a bit of a surprise on Wednesday, but it was another example of the Steelers adding a player on the offensive side of the ball who is familiar with new offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Still, that move isn't enough as the Steelers still have a glaring need for a veteran WR2 opposite George Pickens, allowing rookie Roman Wilson to slide to a more comfortable WR3 role in his first NFL season.\n\n\"The Steelers traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers this offseason, and despite the additions of Van Jefferson and Scott Miller in free agency and Roman Wilson in the third round of the draft, their receiving corps is on track to lean heavily on George Pickens in 2024,\" PFF's Gordon McGuinness writes regarding the move the Steelers need to make. \"Pickens has impressed in two NFL seasons, ranking 20th at the position with an average of 2.05 yards per route run in 2023. Still, the Steelers have been rumored to be a trade candidate for a veteran wideout.\"\n\nLosing Johnson was a big blow to the Steelers' wide receiver room. They lost their best route runner and separator, their true X receiver. They haven't filled the void either, even with the excitement surrounding Wilson, who was taken in the third round of the NFL Draft.\n\nPittsburgh seems to be going quantity over quality at the receiver position for now, which is rather surprising. Some combination of Van Jefferson, Quez Watkins, Miller and Calvin Austin III behind Pickens and Wilson isn't going to get it done. The Steelers have been speculated about as a team that could swing big in the trade market this summer for a big-name receiver, but we'll see if Khan wants to wade into those waters.\n\nOn paper, having that veteran experience of Jefferson, Watkins and Miller in the room seems fine. But on the field, none of those guys are going to concern defensive coordinators, making it very hard to take away double teams from Pickens on the outside. That could really cause the Steelers' passing game to flounder.\n\nBut as things stand currently at receiver, it's not good enough, especially on a team that aims to compete this season for a Super Bowl title.\n\nAs for ESPN, the move that the Steelers need to make is shoring up their cornerback room.\n\nPittsburgh added cornerback Donte Jackson from the Carolina Panthers in the swap for Johnson and drafted Texas defensive back Ryan Watts in the sixth round. But outside of those two, the depth is a major concern behind Joey Porter Jr.\n\nAaron Schatz believes the Steelers need to address the nickelback position.\n\n\"Cornerbacks Joey Porter Jr. and Donte Jackson will be the starters on the outside, but who will play in the slot for the Steelers this season? Darius Rush and Josiah Scott each were charted with just four targets in 2023,\" Schatz writes. \"Other options include sixth-round rookie Ryan Watts out of Texas and second-year cornerback Cory Trice Jr., a 2023 seventh-round pick out of Purdue who spent his rookie season on injured reserve.\n\n\"Perhaps the Steelers should consider a small contract to bring back a veteran ex-Steeler, such as Patrick Peterson or Ahkello Witherspoon.\"\n\nThe Steelers, to be entirely fair, are very, very young at the cornerback position. Porter enters his second season, while Trice and Rush enter Year 2 as well, though Trice will be in his first full season after a torn ACL suffered in training camp.\n\nBanking on those is very concerning though, so more depth is needed like Schatz points out. That could come in the form of a reunion with Peterson, whom the Steelers cut in March, or it could come in the form of a reunion with Cameron Sutton, should his legal situation be resolved.\n\nPittsburgh has rebuilt its cornerback room over the last few seasons, but depth is a real concern entering the 2024 season, so the Steelers could -- and largely should -- be focused on addressing the depth chart at the position this summer.\n\nRelated Items:George Pickens, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pro Football Focus, Quez Watkins, Roman Wilson, Scotty Miller, Trending, Van Jefferson

Outside of third-round pick Roman Wilson, they haven't made any significant additions this offseason. There is reason to believe, however, that they seriously explored other options without pulling the trigger. One wonders what role Calvin Austin III plays in all of this.\n\nA 2022 fourth-round draft pick, Austin is going into his third season, but second on the field. He spent his rookie year on the Reserve/Injured List, but failed to capture an extended role in 2023. Yet with both Diontae Johnson and Allen Robinson II gone from last season, there are plenty of snaps available.\n\nThat's one theory, at least, but under Arthur Smith as offensive coordinator, there may be fewer wide receiver snaps. He runs more heavy sets than just about everybody and only somewhat rarely has three or more wide receivers on the field at the same time. In other words, Austin may need to find himself in two-receiver packages.\n\nGoing against him is his size. At 5-9, 162 pounds, Austin is one of the smallest players in the league. And let's just say that there were certainly times last year where he probably wished he were bigger. But he also surely wished he had a better offensive coordinator -- and a better quarterback.\n\nIn part, perhaps, the Steelers simply didn't know how to use Calvin Austin under Matt Canada. Perhaps QB Kenny Pickett didn't know how to find him, other than that early 72-yard touchdown. He tried the same connection a couple weeks later, if I recall, and threw an interception.\n\nI don't know what expectations the Steelers have for Austin this year. Personally, I doubt that they're counting on him for all that much. I'm not necessarily convinced he has a roster spot locked up, though he did return punts in 2023. But perhaps Smith and company feel they know how to use him. Perhaps they feel Russell Wilson will know how to find him as their top deep target. Perhaps they already have the wide receiver many think they're looking for?\n\nThe Steelers' 2023 season has been put out of its misery, ending as so many have before in recent years: a disappointing, blowout playoff loss. The only change-up lately is when they miss the playoffs altogether. But with the Buffalo Bills stamping them out in the Wildcard Round, they have another long offseason ahead.\n\nThe biggest question hanging over the team is the quarterback question. Does Russell Wilson make them a Super Bowl-caliber team, or are they wasting a year? Will he play just one season in Pittsburgh before moving on, or the Steelers moving on from him? How will the team address the depth chart?\n\nThe Steelers are past free agency and the draft and their roster for the 2024 season is coming into focus. They made numerous moves through signings and trade -- and release. More than usual, they seemed comfortable creating holes, confident they can fill them. Now that we have so many pieces of the puzzle, however, we merely have a new set of questions to ask.\n\nRelated Items:Calvin Austin III, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Depot After Dark: Steelers Run The North, Former Raven Wants Back In Division, Raiders Picked By Coin Flip?

No. Which is why the Steelers are only at honorable mention on this list,\" Trapasso writes regarding the quarterback situation in Pittsburgh. \"And heck, if Wilson struggles, Fields would assume the starting gig, and it's not unreasonable to envision him playing a dual-threat game-manager role that he can parlay into more job security in 2025 and beyond.\n\n\"Wilson and/or Fields emerging as the steady force that propels the Steelers back to legitimate AFC contention feels unlikely though, and they're both residing in Pittsburgh now on one-year deals, which is why I felt compelled to include them here.\"\n\nIt's understandable that Trapasso would include the Steelers in the conversation of needing a quarterback in the 2025 NFL Draft due simply to the one-year deals that Wilson and Fields are on, especially when looking at it from a 30,000-foot view.\n\nBut that would overlook the reports that have come out since the Steelers signed Wilson and traded for Fields that the Steelers and Wilson intend to do a long-term deal after the season and that the Steelers are aiming to do a multi-year extension with Fields as well.\n\nPittsburgh didn't trade for Fields just to decline his fifth-year option, have him for one year and then let him walk. They also didn't target Wilson for one year in free agency, either. They believe he's a franchise guy, one who could be special.\n\nEverything the Steelers have done this offseason is aimed at winning now, maximizing their championship window with a star-studded defense and a talented roster that is filled with skill players on rookie deals, for the most part.\n\nAll of a sudden changing course and going after a rookie quarterback in 2025 doesn't seem to be in the plans for the Steelers, at least from the perspective of chasing a franchise quarterback. The Steelers certainly could be in the quarterback market in the draft on Day 2 or Day 3 to add depth, but that's about it.\n\nThe Steelers feel very good about where they are when it comes to their quarterback situation. That's all that matters. Let it play out on the field before trying to pigeonhole the Steelers into needing a quarterback early in the 2025 NFL Draft.\n\nRelated Items:CBS Sports, Chris Trapasso, Justin Fields, Pittsburgh Steelers, Russell Wilson, Trending Recommended for you Bill Belichick Chewed Out Patriots Player For Not Following Game Plan Against Steelers Ask Alex: Steelers Mailbag Ben Skowronek Could Be Next Addition To Steelers WR Room (Update)", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_carney@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Josh Carney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBSSports.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBSSports.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Russell-Wilson-Mike-Tomlin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

An annual event that consists mostly of skill position players on offense, and gets them exposure to top brands and their representatives. This event is supposed to act as the players' first introductions to these brands, and some it will be, but most players have at least some brand connections via the NIL system in college in this day and age.\n\nThursday, The NFL officially announced its premiere with Wilson among the 40 players attending the event held in Los Angeles May 16-19. He is the only Steeler listed.\n\nWilson was the only skill position player that the Steelers drafted with the majority of their draft focused on the big guys up front in the trenches. The event has made more of an effort to include a few defensive players each year, and I thought Payton Wilson may have had a chance given he was viewed as one of the top ILBs in the class, pushed down the board by injury concerns, but there were plenty of defensive players drafted ahead of him, so it makes sense for the few defensive spots to be given to them.\n\nLast year, the Steelers had zero players invited to the event, but they had three in 2022 with Kenny Pickett, George Pickens, and Calvin Austin III, and two in 2021 with Najee Harris and Pat Freiermuth.\n\nHere is the trio of players from the 2022 premiere wearing their jerseys for the first time.\n\nRoman Wilson hasn't been assigned a jersey number yet with the Steelers, so that announcement should be coming soon and we might get our first look at him in full Steelers gear at the premiere event.\n\nAs it stands now, he has a good shot at being the WR2 in Pittsburgh. He has more experience in the slot than he does outside, but he is probably better suited than Austin to fill that role. That could change if the Steelers end up acquiring the much-anticipated \"significant playmaker\" at wide receiver before the season.\n\nRelated Items:NFLPA, Pittsburgh Steelers, Roman Wilson, Rookie Premiere Recommended for you ESPN, PFF Identify One Final Roster Move Steelers Need To Make Breer: Teams Should 'Put In The Ask' About Acquiring Najee Harris Five Things To Know About New Steelers WR Scotty Miller", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_mccorkle@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Ross McCorkle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Skill position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Wilson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Pickett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Pickett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Freiermuth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Freiermuth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Roman-Wilson-Pittsburgh-Steelers-16.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 623, "textEnd": 632}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But after posting the most accurate mock draft and nailing Super Bowl after Super Bowl prediction, Good Morning Football's Peter Schrager is setting his sights on a new task. Predicting the NFL schedule. Due to be released next Wednesday, he believes the Pittsburgh Steelers will open the season hosting the New York Giants at home in a primetime, Monday night slot.\n\nSchrager is an insider who hears from teams but it's difficult to say if he's leaning on sourced information or if he's just gathering his own thoughts and insights. It's certainly a prediction and not reporting.\n\nBut assuming it comes true, it'll resemble the way Pittsburgh opened up in 2020. The only difference is the Steelers were the road team for that game, the first they played in the pandemic in front of a completely empty stadium. Pittsburgh came out on top with a 26-16 victory. QB Ben Roethlisberger fired three touchdowns, while RB Benny Snell rushed for 113 yards. Defensively, the Steelers picked off Giants QB Daniel Jones twice and sacked him three times. DL Cam Heyward picked off one of those passes, the first interception of his career.\n\nThe worst part of the game was starting RT Zach Banner suffering a season-ending knee injury that spelled the beginning of the end of his Steelers' career.\n\nThe Giants are coming off a 6-11 2023 season with plenty of uncertainty on their roster. Jones suffered a season-ending ACL tear in November, leaving his Week One availability in question. If he's unable to go, Drew Lock would get the nod. There's also a new backfield led by Devin Singletary after Saquon Barkley signed with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Giants beefed up their defensive line by trading for Carolina Panthers DE Brian Burns, who has posted 20.5 sacks over the past two combined seasons.\n\nPittsburgh is hoping to open another season at home. From 2015 to 2022, the Steelers began every season on the road before that streak finally halted in 2023 when the team hosted the San Francisco 49ers. But the Pittsburgh Pirates' homestand might push the team to play on the road, meaning that part of Schrager's prediction probably won't come true. It seems plausible the team could begin the year on the road against the Denver Broncos, setting up QB Russell Wilson to face his former team.\n\nRelated Items:Cameron Heyward, New York Giants, Peter

Is this a trade-off the fans would be ok with?\n\nThe trade might have also cost the Steelers center Zach Frazier. If Pittsburgh had chosen to value offensive tackle higher, Patrick Paul might have been the pick instead and the choice of Mason McCormick might be viewed as the team's center option. It might have also meant the Steelers didn't select wide receiver Roman Wilson with their first pick in the third round.\n\nSo instead of how the first four rounds of the draft turned out, it might have looked like this.\n\nAs much as we love Aiyuk and think he could help the team, for the cost, I'm good with how the Steelers draft turned out as opposed to this potential alternative.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troy Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KmLnAzY9r0EXU9WSGFneKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pittsburgh_steelers_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_164/523a6b0a6a1e2f9e324034c4bda20866", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

In Khan's first two drafts leading the Steelers' front office, he's taken offensive linemen in the first round both times, even taking three in the first four rounds in 2024.\n\nBut there's been another trend in Khan's roster construction that has appeared in 2024: an emphasis on speed.\n\nIn that case, it's less of a philosophy than it is a reaction. The Steelers were noticeably slow in 2024, lacking true speedsters on either side of the ball beyond depth receiver Calvin Austin III, who only recorded 17 catches and a touchdown in 2023.\n\nInstead, the Steelers' roster was full of players like Allen Robinson, Patrick Peterson, and Levi Wallace -- all somewhat solid, but well below average in terms of speed at their respective positions. The issue compounded later in the season as injuries decimated the Steelers defense, forcing the team to turn to players such as Eric Rowe, Mykal Walker, and Myles Jack. They provided some quality snaps, but were still clearly a step behind the athleticism of modern NFL offenses.\n\nIn the 2024 offseason, Khan has clearly focused on making sure that doesn't happen again. The team jettisoned Peterson and Wallace in free agency and brought in Donte Jackson, a veteran corner with a decent overall profile but undeniably blazing 4.32 speed.\n\nIn the middle of their defense, the team upgraded with the addition of Patrick Queen (4.5 speed), one of the most athletic linebackers in the league. In the draft, they added another linebacker in Payton Wilson (4.43 speed), an athletic freak himself who once hit 23 miles per hour in-game while chasing down a runner while at NC State.\n\nOn offense, the Steelers' need for speed has been even more apparent. Pittsburgh released Allen Robinson and added four receivers that ran sub-4.4-second 40-yard dashes coming out of college in Van Jefferson, Quez Watkins, Roman Wilson, and Scotty Miller. Watkins and Miller especially are known as deep threats who can take the top off a defense. Add Calvin Austin's 4.32 to that mix, and you have a wide receiver depth chart that can flat-out fly behind George Pickens, who is quite the downfield threat himself.\n\nIf quarterback Russell Wilson's deep ball is anything close to what it used to be, the Steelers' vertical offense might be a lot of fun to watch this season.\n\nIt's unlikely that the five receivers just mentioned will all make the Steelers' 53-man roster in 2024, but the majority will, adding a heavy dosage of athleticism to the depth chart. Compare that to 2023, where not one of the Steelers' top three receivers ran under a 4.47 coming out of college.\n\nThe takeaway here isn't that all the names mentioned are expected to be premier players in 2024 -- the Steelers still need help at receiver and corner -- but rather that there's been a concentrated effort to fill out the roster with top-notch speed, even by NFL standards. The upgrades in that category, especially in the team's receiver and linebacker rooms, cannot be understated enough. The Steelers won't just be bigger and tougher in 2024. They'll be significantly faster, too.", "source": {"uri": "behindthesteelcurtain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Behind the Steel Curtain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryland_bickley@behindthesteelcurtain.com", "name": "Ryland Bickley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levi Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Austin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allen Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Peterson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Peterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykal_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mykal Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Queen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donte_Jackson_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donte Jackson (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Jack", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myles Jack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_State_Wolfpack_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NC State Wolfpack football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotty_Miller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotty Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quez_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quez Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Van Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1c9Ips8O0j3BijV1OSVIYYCtw3Y=/0x0:4542x2271/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25439136/1455810534.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

A day after reports linked him to the Cowboys in a possible trade, it was reported that the Steelers running back asked Pittsburgh not to pick up his fifth-year option, a report that was quickly and emphatically dismissed by his agent.\n\nAt this point, all signs point to Harris returning to Pittsburgh in 2024. The Steelers have made no secrets about their plans to \"roll\" over opponents this season by employing a strong running attack, led by Harris and emerging teammate Jaylen Warren. But it's also fair to wonder if there's any truth to the recent speculation regarding Harris and his future in Pittsburgh.\n\nIf the Steelers actually consider trading Harris, they would probably find more than a few teams who would be interested. The Steelers need help at receiver, so it's possible they could consider trading Harris if that meant getting a wideout in return.\n\nHere's a quick look at some of the teams that would be good fits for Harris, the only NFL running back who has rushed for 1,000 yards in each of the past three seasons.\n\n49ers\n\nThis makes a lot of sense for both teams. The Steelers have reportedly been trying to acquire either Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel. The 49ers could use a running back who can take some of the load off Christian McCaffrey. Making this scenario even more plausible is the fact that Harris grew up on the West Coast, so this would be a homecoming of sorts.\n\nBroncos\n\nLike the 49ers, the Broncos can use an upgrade a running back. They also have a veteran wideout that the Steelers could use. In Denver, Harris would complement Javonte Williams, who is now two years removed from a serious knee injury. In exchange, the Steelers could ask for Courtland Sutton, a veteran wideout who caught a career-high 10 touchdown passes from Russell Wilson in 2023.\n\nGiants\n\nBig Blue already has several former Steelers on their offense in wideouts Gunner Olszewski, Miles Boykin and Allen Robinson, so it's clear that the Giants like something that the Steelers' offense has been doing. Harris would also be a good complement to Devin Singletary, a smaller back who had success during his first two NFL stops in Buffalo and Houston. New York has several wideouts it could trade in this scenario, with Darius Slayton making the most sense. The former fifth-round pick has carved out a solid career so far and would help open things up for George Pickens.\n\nSeahawks\n\nKenneth Walker III has been great, but he's also battled injuries each of his first two seasons. Adding Harris would help keep him fresh. In return, the Steelers could get Tyler Lockett, an established veteran who should still have some gas left in the tank. Seattle has the depth at wideout to make this happen.\n\nChargers\n\nLos Angeles has two former Ravens leading their backfield in JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards. But Dobbins missed virtually the entire 2023 season after tearing his Achilles, and Edwards has never been a lead back. Harris would add insurance while strengthening Jim Harbaugh's backfield. The Chargers' receiving corps isn't deep after parting with Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, but they may be willing to part with Josh Palmer, a 2021 third-round pick who probably still hasn't reached his potential.\n\nRaiders\n\nAfter losing Josh Jacobs in free agency, the Raiders' running back situation is murky. Harris would provide much-needed stability while joining a backfield that is currently led by Zamir White and former Viking Alexander Mattison. The issue here is what the Steelers would get in return. Would the Raiders be interested in dealing Davante Adams? If they were, this would be a slam dunk for Pittsburgh, even if it has to sweeten the pot in order to get a deal done.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"},

A quick hit of some Pittsburgh Steelers-related stories that may not require a complete article but nuggets worth mentioning and passing on to you guys.\n\nYour Depot After Dark for May 8.\n\nSteelers Rule The North\n\nWarren Sharp shared this stat showing how successful the Pittsburgh Steelers have been against their AFC North foes. Dating back to 2020, the Steelers are 16-8 against the division, while the Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals are .500 or below.\n\nFor the record, Sharp was a typo there. The Browns are 12-12 against the North, while the Bengals are 9-15, going 1-5 versus the North in 2020 and 2023. Still, the Steelers haven't won the division since 2020, a drought the team is looking to break in 2024.\n\nWe're sorry, the video cannot be played with adblocker enabled.\n\nPlease disable your adblocker and refresh the page, or go ad-free!\n\nFormer Raven Wants Back In AFC North\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens WR Willie Snead is dreaming of the AFC North. He tweeted Wednesday that he needs to be back in the division, saying, \"That brand of football is just different.\"\n\nSnead appeared in four games in 2023 for the NFC West San Francisco 49ers, catching two passes for 14 yards. Much of his career and success came with the Baltimore Ravens from 2018-2020, when he caught 126 passes for over 1,400 yards. He began his career as an undrafted free agent with the Cleveland Browns, though he never appeared in a game with the team. Now 31 years old, Snead will do well by just getting his foot back in the league when training camps open up.\n\nRaiders Picked By Coin Flip?\n\nThis is not related to the Steelers or the AFC North, but it is an interesting story about Detroit Lions first-round pick CB Terrion Arnold. After falling 10-15 spots further than expected, Arnold said he was told by a Las Vegas Raiders coach who called him after the draft that a coin flip determined whether or not the team would take him or Georgia TE Brock Bowers.\n\n\"We actually had a coin toss between you and Brock Bowers,\" he said via The Next Round podcast. \"It landed on him.\"\n\nIs that a literal comment or a turn of phrase by the Raiders? For their sake, hopefully the latter. It's also kinda crazy - to me - for an opposing coach to call someone drafted by another team one day later. Maybe that's common, but the first I've heard of it. Either way, sometimes teams draft the same way you pick what you're eating for dinner.\n\nRelated Items:Depot After Dark, Pittsburgh Steelers, Terrion Arnold, Warren Sharp, Willie Snead Recommended for you Peter Schrager Predicts Steelers Will Open Season Hosting Giants Monday Night Steelers Invite Former Pitt QB Phil Jurkovec To Minicamp (As A Tight End) Film Room: What The Steelers Are Getting With WR Scotty Miller", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Snead_IV", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willie Snead IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Bowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Bowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Raiders", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Raiders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schrager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schrager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/DepoAfterDark.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 212, "textEnd": 217}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

But Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer believes teams should at least check in on Harris given that the Steelers also have RB Jaylen Warren. In his mailbag, Breer answered a reader question about the Raiders acquiring Najee Harris, and while he wasn't sure about the price to acquire him, Breer thinks teams around the league should ask about trading for Harris.\n\n\"A Day 2 pick, maybe? I don't know, to be honest,\" Breer wrote about what it would cost Las Vegas to trade for Harris. \"But there are a few teams, given that the Pittsburgh Steelers have Jaylen Warren, who should put in the ask.\"\n\nTeams ask around about pretty much every player in the league. It doesn't mean a trade is going to happen, and unless the Steelers get an offer they can't refuse for Harris, I find it hard to believe he's going anywhere. Now, this is likely his last season in Pittsburgh. An extension feels unlikely after the Steelers declined his option, and they seem to like what they have in Warren.\n\nBut let's consider for a second where the Steelers are this season. They just hired an offensive coordinator in Arthur Smith who loves to run the ball, added Russell Wilson and Justin Fields to upgrade the quarterback room, and are pretty firmly in win-now mode. Warren is talented and can lead the backfield, sure, but why make that room worse in exchange for future draft capital when you can run both backs in a season where you're aiming to win? It just doesn't make a ton of sense.\n\nNo team is trading a first-round pick for Harris, and he's now going to play behind the best offensive line he ever has with the Steelers. He's still managed to run for over 1,000 yards each of his first three years in the league, and while his yards per carry output hasn't been the best, he's shown flashes. A better offensive line should raise his ceiling this season. Getting a future third-round pick for him might feel nice come next offseason, but it leaves the Steelers with a hole at running back next to Warren in 2024, a season where they're pushing their chips in the table and betting on being competitive and trying to finally win a playoff game for the first time since 2016.\n\nTeams will check in, and they should, because Harris can elevate the backfield in a lot of different places right now, and the Steelers do have a solid alternative in Warren. But I'm really hard-pressed to see any realistic scenario where Harris is wearing another uniform come 2024.\n\nRelated Items:Albert Breer, Jaylen Warren, Najee Harris, Pittsburgh Steelers, Sports Illustrated, Trending Recommended for you Five Things To Know About New Steelers WR Scotty Miller Jerome Bettis 'Surprised' Steelers Didn't Pick Up Najee Harris' Option Arthur Smith Not 'A Person Who Has Complete Autonomy' Under Tomlin, Steelers, Kinkhabwala Says", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Warren", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Bettis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Bettis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Najee-Harris-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe agent for Pittsburgh Steelers running back Najee Harris fired back at a recent claim about the running back's contract demands and happiness with the organization.\n\n93.7 The Fan radio host Paul Zeise recently claimed that Harris asked the Steelers to decline his fifth-year option, citing a desire to play elsewhere. Zeise added that his source was the same one that correctly predicted that the Steelers would trade for quarterback Justin Fields.\n\nThe claim was enough to elicit a response from Doug Hendrickson, Harris' agent. Hendrickson called out Zeise on X, calling Zeise's alleged source a \"joke\" and suggesting he \"find a real source\" in the future.\n\nHarris may not have made such a demand, and even if he did, it would have been odd for the Steelers to accommodate it. They may well have their own reasons for the surprising decision to pass on picking up Harris' option. Even if not, it is not in Harris' best interests for such a report to be widely accepted as true.\n\nHarris remained productive in 2024, tallying 1,035 yards and eight touchdowns on 255 attempts. However, he has lost some work to Jaylen Warren, and may envision himself getting more opportunities elsewhere.

That makes sense after the running back played just 53 percent of the snaps last season, which was the lowest mark of his career.\n\nHowever, Pryor also noted the AFC North team isn't ruling out an eventual new contract with the Alabama product after the 2024 campaign if the fit makes sense.\n\nPittsburgh selected Harris with a first-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft, and he has run for more than 1,000 yards in each of his first three seasons in the league. He hasn't always been the most efficient with his opportunities and has averaged 3.9 yards per carry during that span.\n\nStill, he posted a career-best 4.1 yards per carry in 2023 even with his fewest rushing attempts (255).\n\nHarris showed promising signs last season and is still just 26 years old. Caution, especially at the running back position, is a reasonable approach from the team's perspective, but another successful season could have him in line for a notable new contract next offseason.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether that will be with the Steelers or someone else, but Thursday's clarification suggests Harris isn't already eyeing the opportunity to sign with a different team.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najee_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Najee Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715283533/hjgnna811bpc7nlei81n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Join us as we revisit these moments in our \"Steelers Throwback Thursday\" series.\n\nThe NFL Draft wasn't always the huge ceremonial event it has become, but plenty of Pittsburgh Steelers fans have been keen on following the team's moves throughout the years; some made it an annual holiday-type hobby to religiously follow. The 1987 NFL Draft was the last time the event was held during the week (not on a weekend), and there were several notable, players that the Steelers selected that year. We look back at the class and highlight the standouts for the black and gold.\n\nWoodson is arguably the most-remembered pick for the Steelers in this 1987 draft class. That he was available for Pittsburgh in the first round is already an amazing story, but the fact the Hall of Famer was not someone the Steelers spent much time scouting is another. As Bob Labriola of Steelers.com wrote:\n\nOnce the Steelers returned from having seen Woodson perform in Indianapolis (in January 1987), and the scouts and coaches gathered to put schedules together to re-visit some of the players, Tony Dungy, then the defensive coordinator, said Chuck Noll had told him not to bother scheduling a visit to Purdue because there was no way Woodson would still be on the board when it came time for the Steelers to make the 10th overall pick of the first round.\n\nWoodson played in 44 games as a Purdue Boilermaker, recording 445 tackles and 11 interceptions in the defensive backfield while also playing running back, receiver, punt and kickoff returner, and running track as an outstanding hurdler. Woodson's 4.31 40-yard dash time was eye-opening.\n\nWoodson spent ten seasons with the Steelers and logged 38 interceptions for 779 yards and five touchdowns primarily as a cornerback. Woodson also returned 257 punts for 2,362 yards and two touchdowns. He returned 220 kickoffs for 4,894 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nAfter numerous awards and seven more seasons in the league, Woodson retired only to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a member of the Steelers in 2009.\n\nLloyd, who famously sported a tee that read, \"I wasn't hired for my disposition,\" at training camp in 1993, was another linebacker in a line of linebacker greats to play for the Steelers. His collegiate football career was played as a member of the Fort Valley State Wildcats, an NCAA Division II school in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. He was not invited to the Pro Scouting Combine, but was scouted in the Heritage Bowl, a historically black college All-Star game and worked out for the scout Tom Donahoe.\n\nIn ten seasons with Pittsburgh, Lloyd was named first-team All-Pro three times (1993-1995), was a two-time NFL forced fumbles co-leader (1994, 1995), and earned five Pro Bowl bids (1991-1995). That's the type of career any player from a Division I school would be proud to own.\n\nLloyd was a sideline-to-sideline menace but also a terror to opposing quarterbacks. In 131 games with the Steelers, Lloyd grabbed 10 interceptions, forced 34 fumbles, had 53.5 sacks, and 727 combined tackles.\n\nHoge was a three-time all-Big Sky Conference selection (1984-1986) at running back for Idaho State. He set an NCAA record in 1985 with 2,114 all-purpose yards (192.1 per game) and set the school record 1,041 rushing yards. At the end of his collegiate career, Hoge had an NCAA record 5,453 all-purpose yards and 31 touchdowns.\n\nIn the modern era, a tenth-round selection is not only an impossibility, but would traditionally signify a pick used on a player that might make the squad if he showed promise in training camp or be used for development and depth.\n\nHoge, however, moved from running back to fullback in Pittsburgh and carried the ball 819 times for 3,115 yards and 21 touchdowns in his seven seasons with the team. His primary rushing partners were Warren Williams and Earnest Jackson early in his career. In 1990, he was rushing with and blocking for Tim Worley, Williams and Barry Foster (sparingly). Hoge recorded 241 catches for 2,054 yards and 13 receiving touchdowns as well.\n\n\"Find a way. Those words have helped me live a dream and fight to live.\" - Merril Hoge\n\nIn 1994, Hoge suffered two serious head injuries after joining the Chicago Bears and was forced into retirement from playing in the league after he had to be resuscitated and placed into intensive care. Hoge worked with Steelers team doctor Joseph Maroon and went on to actively campaign for improvements in player safety, especially surrounding head injuries, in the league while moving into broadcasting and public speaking.\n\nNickerson was straight out of Compton, similar to the movie of the same title, and played collegiate football for the University of California Golden Bears. While his prime playing years didn't occur in Pittsburgh but in Tampa Bay, Nickerson provided the Steelers six years of play, recording five forced fumbles, 9.5 sacks, and 426 tackles.", "source":

While the team could look to make a splash via trade, Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette told The PM Team on 93.7 The Fan that he doesn't expect any trades to happen until late July.\n\n\"I still think a trade is a possibility, not soon, I think they're gonna take a look at things here in OTAs, minicamp and training camp, and if they don't like what they see, I could see them doing some wheeling and dealing in late July, early August.\"\n\nFittipaldo pointed out that last summer, the Steelers made a few additions to their inside linebacker room, namely Kwon Alexander and Nick Kwitakoski during training camp to bolster that room. Right now, the receiver room is probably Pittsburgh's weakest link, and they have a lot of depth in the form of No. 4-type receivers but no legitimate option to play alongside George Pickens and/or Roman Wilson.\n\nAfter June 1st, making a trade becomes easier due to cap reasons, and that's the most likely avenue for the Steelers to acquire a significant option at receiver. It sounds as if the team won't rush to make a move though, and rather evaluate their depth and look to make a move when training camp begins or towards the beginning of camp. That will also open up some avenues for the team to potentially make a favorable trade if players are holding out from camp due to contract reasons, and the Steelers could look at DK Metcalf or Courtland Sutton as potential options to bolster their receiver room.\n\nIt probably behooves the Steelers to be patient in the trade market, but they have to make sure they don't wait too long and are able to secure a legitimate difference-maker if they do want to make a trade for a receiver. Their receiver room as it stands doesn't really have a legitimate No. 2 or someone who can play outside across from Pickens, and that will likely be the type of player they look to target. We'll see if they're able to make a trade happen, but it doesn't sound as if anything will be in the works for at least the next two months, so don't hold your breath waiting for the Steelers to upgrade the room.\n\nRelated Items:93.7 The Fan, Courtland Sutton, DK Metcalf, Pittsburgh Steelers, Ray Fittipaldo, Trending Recommended for you PFF Steve Believes Roman Wilson Has Chance To Be 'That Guy' At Outside Receiver Jags OLB Josh Allen Names Steelers' T.J.

He had 164 targets, which was fifth in the NFL, and his 119 catches were tied for second in the league. And he did all of this predominantly as a slot receiver. 55 percent of his snaps came lined up in the slot. The Indianapolis Colts and Josh Downs is utilized even more in the slot with 81 percent of his snaps coming as a slot receiver, which was second in the NFL last season of all receivers with at least 50 targets. Downs and St. Brown are each of their respective teams' No. 1 receivers, and they operate predominantly from the slot with boundary receivers that are less than optimal.\n\nThe Lions' top boundary target last season was Josh Reynolds- he had 64 targets and 40 catches. Jameson Williams had 42 targets and 24 catches. And similar to what the Steelers will look to do offensively, the Lions really leaned on the run game. David Montgomery ran for 1,015 yards and Jahmyr Gibbs ran for 945, yet Jared Goff still threw for almost 4,600 yards. They were arguably the most balanced offensive attack in football without a top-tier perimeter receiver. This is all to say that while everyone would like the Steelers to add a big name opposite of George Pickens, there is a real possibility that the hopes of DK Metcalf or Brandon Aiyuk end up actually being Darius Slayton or Treylon Burks.\n\nIf that's the case, the Steelers will really lean on rookie Roman Wilson to be a big producer alongside George Pickens, who would also need to continue improving as a route-runner to take over as the predominant No. 1 receiver. A top three group of Pickens, Slayton, and Wilson or Pickens, Wilson, and Burks wouldn't be a top five trio on paper, but again, look at the Lions' model- the Steelers have a lot of what the Lions have:\n\nThe Steelers have two running backs in Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris, a receiving threat tight end in Pat Freiermuth, an offensive line that should be much improved, and the ability to utilize both George Pickens and Roman Wilson in the slot, while also having Pickens' ability to make splash plays on the outside.

Roman Wilson showed exceptional efficiency & big-play ability in college, making him a perfect fit for the Steelers. Wilson's skill set in the slot aligns with the Steelers' needs, and he is poised to continue their legacy of productive mid-round wide receivers.\n\nThe importance of elite pass catchers continues to grow exponentially in the NFL. The 2024 NFL Draft highlighted this trend with a record-tying seven wide receivers selected in the first round, emphasizing the league's inclination to prioritize top-tier talent at the position early in the draft.\n\nDespite this trend, the Pittsburgh Steelers have mastered a different approach, consistently finding success in the second and third rounds of the draft. While other teams opt for early-round selections to secure their potential playmakers, the Steelers have perfected their formula for uncovering wide receiver studs in the later rounds.\n\nTheir track record speaks volumes, as no team has been more adept at finding receiving talent beyond the first round in recent years.\n\nThis year, the Steelers once again demonstrated their scouting prowess by selecting Michigan's Roman Wilson, who has been called an 'awesome' pick by rival AFC execs, in the third round. A dynamic and explosive talent, Wilson represents the latest addition to Pittsburgh's tradition of unearthing hidden flanker gems.\n\nWith his blend of speed, route-running ability, and playmaking potential, Wilson has all the makings of the next great Steelers wide receiver, poised to make a significant impact in the NFL.\n\nRelated Breaking Down the Madness: Key Trends From Round 1 of the 2024 NFL Draft The first round of the 2024 NFL Draft was highlighted by record-breaking quarterbacks, wide receivers, and a lack of defensive talent. The Day 2 Wide Receiver Factory Steelers have the most 1,000 yard receivers drafted on Day 2 since 2017\n\nIn recent years, the Steelers have proven themselves as masters of drafting wide receiver talent beyond the first round. While other teams may prioritize early-round selections, the Steelers have consistently struck gold in rounds two and three of the NFL Draft. This knack for uncovering gems has solidified their reputation as the premier destination for wide receiver prospects looking to make an impact at the next level.\n\nThe Steelers' prowess in drafting wide receivers on day two of the NFL Draft is unrivaled. Since 2017, they've selected six wideouts in rounds two or three: JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington, Diontae Johnson, Chase Claypool, George Pickens, and now Roman Wilson.\n\nWhile Washington and Claypool may not have reached their full potential, Claypool still put up 11 TDs as a rookie (11th-most all-time for a rookie WR) and Washington and Washington's 16.7 yards per receptions in his second year was a top 10 mark. Smith-Schuster, Johnson, and Pickens were even better, as all achieved 1,000-yard seasons within their first three years in the league.\n\nIf you go back even further, you'll see that this was a common thread throughout Mike Tomlin's tenure with the Steelers, which began in 2007.\n\nTomlin-Drafted WRs in 2nd-3rd Rounds\n\nYear\n\nPlayer\n\nDraft\n\n1k Season/10+ TD Season/Pro Bowl\n\n2008\n\nLimas Sweed\n\n2nd Round (No. 53)\n\nNo\n\n2009\n\nMike Wallace\n\n3rd Round (No 84)\n\nYes\n\n2010\n\nEmmanuel Sanders\n\n3rd Round (No. 82)\n\nYes\n\n2013\n\nMarkus Wheaton\n\n3rd Round (No. 79)\n\nNo\n\n2015\n\nSammie Coates\n\n3rd Round (No. 87)\n\nNo\n\n2017\n\nJuju Smith-Schuster\n\n2nd Round (No. 62)\n\nYes\n\n2018\n\nJames Washington\n\n2nd Round (No. 60)\n\nNo\n\n2019\n\nDiontae Johnson\n\n3rd Round (No. 66)\n\nYes\n\n2020\n\nChase Claypool\n\n2nd Round (No. 49)\n\nYes\n\n2022\n\nGeorge Pickens\n\n2nd Round (No. 52)\n\nYes\n\n2024\n\nRoman Wilson\n\n3rd Round (No. 84)\n\n?\n\nWhat's truly remarkable is that no other team in the NFL has even drafted two players in rounds two or three who produced 1,000-yard seasons during that time span. The Steelers, however, boast three such players. This exceptional success solidifies the Steelers' reputation as the premier destination for wide receiver talent outside the first round.\n\nEfficiency at its Finest Wilson had the highest EPA per target among WRs taken in Rounds 1-3\n\nIt's no secret that Michigan's offensive strategy last season revolved around establishing the run and pounding the rock on the ground. This emphasis on the rushing attack led to suppressed passing numbers for quarterback J.J. McCarthy, and subsequently, muted receiving statistics for Roman Wilson.\n\nHowever, despite these circumstances, Wilson still emerged as one of the most efficient wide receivers in the nation. According to The 33rd Team, Wilson had the highest EPA per target last season among any of the wide receivers selected in the first three rounds of the 2024 draft.\n\nWilson's exceptional EPA per target last season was largely attributed to his knack for finding the end zone and ripping off explosive plays. According to PFF, he scored a touchdown on an impressive 25.0 percent of his receptions, tying for the third-highest rate among any Power Five receiver with more than 30 receptions in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Wilson boasted the fifth-highest explosive reception rate among Power Five receivers, showcasing his ability to make big plays downfield.\n\nMost TDs Per Reception Among Power Five WRs in 2023 (PFF)\n\nPlayer\n\nTDs/Rec\n\nBrendan Rice\n\n0.27\n\nNic Anderson\n\n0.26\n\nRoman Wilson\n\n0.25\n\nBrian Thomas Jr.\n\n0.25\n\nKeon Coleman\n\n0.22\n\nWith his blazing 4.39 speed and savvy route-running, Wilson consistently found ways to create separation, making him a threat to score every time he touched the ball. His combination of speed and skill not only allowed him to find pay dirt but also to consistently produce game-changing plays.\n\nRoman Wilson's Fit in Pittsburgh Over 50 percent of Wilson's college production came from the slot\n\nAt 5'11\" and 185 pounds, Wilson is tailor-made for the slot receiver role, which he predominantly played during his college career at Michigan.\n\nThe Steelers' selection of Wilson fills a crucial need for them in the slot. According to PFF, Allen Robinson, who is now with the New York Giants, led the Steelers in slot alignment at 61.4 percent last season, followed by Calvin Austin at 40.4 percent, and new Panther Diontae Johnson at 21.3 percent. With the departures of Robinson and Johnson, the slot role in Pittsburgh is wide open for Wilson.\n\nIn college, Wilson operated predominantly from the slot, with the majority of his production coming from that alignment. Per PFF, over 50 percent of Wilson's targets, receptions, receiving yards, receiving first downs, and touchdowns in his college career came from the slot. He is a specialist in that role, perfectly suited to fill the void left by Johnson and Robinson.\n\nRoman Wilson Slot Production in College Career (PFF)\n\nCategory\n\nPercent of Production from Slot\n\nTargets\n\n56.7%\n\nReceptions\n\n54.5%\n\nReceiving Yards\n\n56.8%\n\nReceiving First Downs\n\n61.2%\n\nTouchdowns\n\n66.7%\n\nWilson's efficiency, combined with his explosive playmaking ability, makes him the ideal candidate to continue the Steelers' legacy of productive Day 2 receivers.\n\nHis skill set aligns perfectly with the Steelers' offensive scheme, offering a versatile threat who can stretch the field and create mismatches for opposing defenses. With the Steelers' history of developing talent and maximizing the potential of their wide receivers, Wilson is in prime position to thrive in Pittsburgh.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football

Obviously, we'll just wait to see how these new faces do and be able to judge it then. There's so many moving parts and rookies that there's a lot we believe but not much we know. I don't think ILB would surpass QB, especially comparing what the team had at the start of 2023 before everyone got hurt.\n\nO-line, yeah, there's a case. I respect their all-in mentality there. We're going to pour everything into this one group and make it better which makes every extension of the offense better. Run game and pass game. But the QB play, even if Wilson isn't a star, just feels like they can at least get back to normal and basic which feels so low-level but something the team's lacked the last two years. But the o-line could become one of football's best units and I doubt we'll say the same about quarterback. Pittsburgh has just been starved there.\n\nIn short, yeah, you can argue o-line over QB.\n\nRelated Items:Alex Kozora, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Bill Belichick Chewed Out Patriots Player For Not Following Steelers Game Plan Ben Skowronek Could Be Next Addition To Steelers WR Room (Update) Schefter: Bud Dupree Talking With Steelers, Reunion Possible", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/StockSteelersMailbag.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Listen to Bill Belichick.\n\nRule number two of playing for Bill Belichick. See rule number one.\n\nWide receiver Chris Hogan found out what happens if you don't. Former New England Patriots RB James White joined The Bottom Line View podcast Thursday and shared a story of Belichick's game planning ahead of a 2016 game versus the Steelers. And how one player didn't carry it out.\n\n\"All week long, he talks about their defensive front,\" White told host Mitch Milani of Belichick's coaching point. \"You throw the ball past the line of scrimmage, they chase. They punch the ball. They're very active. First drive of the game, we come out there. Throw a hitch route to a receiver/tight end...pretty sure first play of the game. Outside linebacker strips the ball from the receiver. Fumble, turnover.\"\n\nWhite took the high road not to name names. But you know we went back and looked it up. New England came to town in Week Seven of the 2016 season. And on the Patriots' first snap, QB Tom Brady completed a short pass to WR Chris Hogan. True to Belichick's report, the Steelers chased and OLB Jarvis Jones punched the ball out, recovering the fumble. Steelers ball. Here's the play.\n\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/e68ea905e159a8dd90af367ae8093743.mp4\n\nJones didn't live up to his first round billing but he made the occasional splash play, including this one in coverage. Fortunately for Hogan, the fumble didn't ultimately cost the Patriots. Like most games, New England came out on top, beating Pittsburgh 27-16. Still, it didn't soothe Belichick in the next meeting.\n\n\"Come back to the meeting room, Bill lets him have it,\" White said. \"'We talked about this shit ad nauseum. We told you the defensive linemen, they're going to chase, they're going to punch.'\"\n\nChasing the ball has been a hallmark for the Steelers' front seven. It's what DL Coach John Mitchell preached and was key under DCs Dick LeBeau and Keith Butler, remaining true today for Teryl Austin. Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt are and were two of the most high-motor players in franchise history, making it tough for teams to throw screens or work their quick game.\n\nBut most of the time, Patriots' players heeded Belichick's advice. White credits Belichick as one of the best minds he's been around.\n\n\"When he reiterates stuff throughout the week, nine times out of ten, the shit happens...he's one of the most unique minds in the game of football.\"\n\nBelichick will try to convince teams of that next year when the hiring cycle kicks back up. Left without a job in 2024, it looks like he'll try his hand in media this year, already appearing on ESPN's draft coverage - earning rave reviews - with plans to be part of Peyton and Eli Manning's Omaha Productions throughout the fall.\n\nRelated Items:Bill Belichick, Chris Hogan, James White, Jarvis Jones, New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Ask Alex: Steelers Mailbag Ben Skowronek Could Be Next Addition To Steelers WR Room (Update) Schefter: Bud Dupree Talking With Steelers, Reunion Possible", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kozora@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Alex Kozora", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hogan_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hogan (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_White_(running_back)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James White (running back)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarvis Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Skowronek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Skowronek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teryl_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teryl Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Butler_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keith Butler (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_LeBeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dick LeBeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephon_Tuitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephon Tuitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eli Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/StockJarvisJones1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553702", "eventUri": "eng-9553702", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Here are five storylines to follow:\n\n1.First impression for the 1st-rounder\n\nThe man with arguably the least at stake this weekend likely also is the one with the most eyes on him. First-round pick Troy Fautanu, of course, will make the season-opening roster, and by all indications figures to have a bright future in the NFL as a starting offensive tackle. He has been previously vetted by Steelers management more than any of his peers at rookie camp.\n\nBut this weekend is Fautanu's first chance to ply his trade in Steelers-branded equipment and alongside new teammates. His pedigree dictates he should be the best player on the field. What kind of impression can he make? It's a first crack at earning a potential starting job in 2024.\n\n2. Troy and the boys\n\nFautanu won't be the only offensive lineman prominent during the workouts. The Steelers' second- and fourth-round picks play center and guard, respectively. Inasmuch as it might mean in a short walkthrough featuring no established veterans, it's expected that Fautanu, center Zach Frazier and guard Mitch McCormick will line up together as part of the \"first-team\" offensive line.\n\nIt could be quite the foreshadowing of what Steelers fans might hope is a decade-long trio anchoring the trenches of their offense beginning as soon as 2025. Fautanu, Frazier and McCormick have long ways to go in establishing themselves in their pro careers, but Friday might be a day they look back on because it was the first time they took their positions in formations together in an official capacity as Steelers.\n\n3. Wilson & Wilson\n\nThe only players the Steelers drafted before Round 6 who were not offensive linemen share a surname. Something else that both Roman Wilson and Payton Wilson have in common is that early anecdotal indications project high expectations as rookie third-round picks.\n\nIn Roman Wilson's case, he had better meet them, too, if the Steelers are to be successful offensively in 2024 -- at least when looking at how the roster stands right now. Wilson currently could slot as high as the Steelers WR2 behind George Pickens. Even the more realistic scenario of Wilson proving a worthy slot WR3 will take some proving on his part that he's ready for such a role as a rookie.\n\nThere's a little more leeway for Payton Wilson because inside linebacker has a pair of starters in place with veterans Patrick Queen and Elandon Roberts (plus Cole Holcomb coming off of a major injury). But as the reigning Bednarik Award winner as college football's best defensive player, it will be worth watching how much Payton Wilson's considerable skills pop on a pro practice field.\n\nPerhaps he'll even get to show off his coverage chops against a precisely run route by Roman Wilson over the middle?\n\n4. Not just draft picks\n\nWhile the aforementioned players join fellow draft picks Logan Lee and Ryan Watts as the highest-profile of the rookies, don't forget about the undrafted free-agent class highlighted by West Virginia slot cornerback Beanie Bishop and Georgia running back Daijun Edwards.\n\nAlso eligible for rookie minicamp are first-year players, defined in the NFL as those who entered the league before 2024 but have not accrued a season of service time.\n\nAdditionally, a bevy of rookie tryouts will be given a shot to show they belong in the NFL after being passed over for 257 draft selections and unsigned in the hours and days that follow. Typically, the Steelers sign a tryout or two each year.\n\nA handful of veterans show up on a tryout basis, too. One of the names that has leaked is five-year NFL running back Jonathan Ward, who has played in 42 career games for Arizona and Tennessee.\n\n5. Local connections\n\nAmong the tryouts are several prospects with local ties. The most recognizable of this year's crop is former Pine-Richland and Pitt (and Notre Dame) quarterback Phil Jurkovec. He is taking part as a tight end.\n\nCornerback Marquis Williams is another Pitt product confirmed with an invite, as is former Duquesne wide receiver DJ Powell.\n\nExpect the minicamp list to be filled out with names you might remember from the WPIAL or, perhaps, PSAC -- in addition to others from Pitt and/or West Virginia, Penn State, etc.\n\nAfter a lifetime in the sport, it might be the final time on a competitive football field for some.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_adamski@triblive.com", "name": "Chris

Though not reported by any outlet, the team website showed Jackson getting fitted for his helmet in a Thursday article previewing the weekend.\n\nIt's not clear in what capacity Jackson is coming to Pittsburgh but it's likely on a tryout basis instead of being under contract. Though the team has Chris Boswell and signed Matthew Wright, neither are eligible for rookie minicamp and Pittsburgh needed a kicker to be able to practice.\n\nJackson, 25, was one of 16 members of the NFL's 2024 IPP program that's already placed several members on NFL rosters. The Chiefs signed rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit while the Buffalo Bills drafted United Kingdom OT Travis Clayton. Like the rest of the IPP players, Jackson participated in South Florida's Pro Day, where Pittsburgh had a scout on-hand, and hitting from 55-yards out. He was also invited to this year's Combine., leading the group with a 76-yard kickoff.\n\nJackson, from Wicklow, also took part in the Steelers' kicking camp held in Ireland last month. Former Steelers punter Jordan Berry and kicker Shaun Suisham were in attendance and likely passed on a positive report to Omar Khan and company. It marks the second year the team has invited a kicker from an international tryout, adding Mexico's Alfredo Gach\u00faz last spring. He did not sign with Pittsburgh but spent time in the CFL with Toronto.\n\nJackson served as a goalie for Wicklow County, known for his strong leg and ability to drive a soccer ball. He had recently returned to his club but is back in the States for his Steelers' tryout.\n\nThat skillset has translated in his transition to American football and he'll get a chance to impress the team this weekend. Pittsburgh's minicamp will be held Friday through Sunday. He'll look to join fellow Irish soccer player Charlie Smyth on an NFL roster. Smyth signed with the New Orleans Saints earlier this year.\n\nRelated Items:Mark Jackson, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Ray Fittipaldo Thinks Steelers Could Make WR Trade In Late July Or August Jags OLB Josh Allen Names Steelers' T.J.

Though the team has Chris Boswell and signed Matthew Wright, neither are eligible for rookie minicamp and Pittsburgh needed a kicker to be able to practice.\n\nJackson, 25, was one of 16 members of the NFL's 2024 IPP program that's already placed several members on NFL rosters. The Chiefs signed rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit while the Buffalo Bills drafted United Kingdom OT Travis Clayton. Like the rest of the IPP players, Jackson participated in South Florida's Pro Day, where Pittsburgh had a scout on-hand, and hitting from 55-yards out. He was also invited to this year's Combine., leading the group with a 76-yard kickoff.\n\nJackson, from Wicklow, also took part in the Steelers' kicking camp held in Ireland last month. Former Steelers punter Jordan Berry and kicker Shaun Suisham were in attendance and likely passed on a positive report to Omar Khan and company. It marks the second year the team has invited a kicker from an international tryout, adding Mexico's Alfredo Gach\u00faz last spring. He did not sign with Pittsburgh but spent time in the CFL with Toronto.\n\nJackson served as a goalie for Wicklow County, known for his strong leg and ability to drive a soccer ball. He had recently returned to his club but is back in the States for his Steelers' tryout.\n\nThat skillset has translated in his transition to American football and he'll get a chance to impress the team this weekend. Pittsburgh's minicamp will be held Friday through Sunday. He'll look to join fellow Irish soccer player Charlie Smyth on an NFL roster. Smyth signed with the New Orleans Saints earlier this year.\n\nRelated Items:Mark Jackson, Pittsburgh Steelers Recommended for you Ray Fittipaldo Thinks Steelers Could Make WR Trade In Late July Or August Jags OLB Josh Allen Names Steelers' T.J.

She also indicated that the INDIA bloc can stake claim later to form the government. The Trinamul Congress supremo, who met her newly-elected party MPs at her Kalighat residence, said, \u201cNo one should think that INDIA will not stake a claim tomorrow just because it didn't do so today. We are waiting for an opportunity and watching the situation. The new government will ultimately belong to INDIA.\u201dShe elaborated, \u201cFor now, let them (NDA) survive for as many days as they can. Let them handle themselves and see how long they can keep their allies happy. I can't wish good luck to the government that is being formed illegally, undemocratically and unconstitutionally. My good wishes for the country. Let us hope for the best.\u201dAsked about the future of the third term of the NDA-rule, Ms Banerjee quipped, \u201cIt may not continue for even 15 days! I'm not an astrologer. I made a mere guess just like I earlier spoke about them not getting the majority.\u201dShe pointed out, \u201cThe difference between NDA and INDIA is that NDA partners crave for more and more while INDIA partners don't want anything except welfare of the people and country. We are dedicated and determined. So let's wait and watch. In terms of performance, the government, even if it survives for a single day, needs to abolish NRC, CAA and UCC, which were passed forcibly.\u201dTaking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ms Banerjee informed that her party would not attend his swearing-in ceremony. She observed, \u201cCountry needs change. No one wants Modi. He should have left his post for someone else after facing such a huge defeat.\u201dShe then added, \u201cNone of you expected the defeat of Modi Babu. A big scam has taken place in the gambling and share market through exit polls. You declared an election even before it was actually announced. It is a big crime. We are exploring options to take legal steps.\u201d\u201cWe have told our party MPs not to sit idle in the House. They will be vocal. But it will also not be possible further to pass any bill with the so-called \u2018two third majority\u2019 and threatening and forcing others.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/didi-nda-govt-wont-last-long-india-can-stake-claim-898004", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/08/1095758-screenshot2024-06-08at82901pm.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:03:31", "author": "Rajib Chowdhuri", "authors": ["Rajib Chowdhuri"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.499}

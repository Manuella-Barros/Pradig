NBC is expected to pay $2.5 billion per season, while Amazon is going to dole out $1.8 billion per year.\n\nIn the current agreement, the ESPN and TNT Sports pay a combined total of $2.6 billion on what is a nine-season agreement.\n\nIf TNT Sports stands down, this upcoming season will be its final season of games after nearly four decades. While Charles Barkley said he plans on retiring, all three networks are expected to pursue him and could just try to bring the entire \"Inside the NBA\" crew over to their platform.\n\nFor NBC, it has Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle as its potential play-by-players. With Dwyane Wade working the Olympics for NBC, he could be in position as a potential No. 1 game analyst.

The three broadcasters will carry the NBA for 11 seasons for $76 billion in total, according to a New York Times report on Wednesday.\n\nThe agreement begins at the start of the 2025 season.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of longtime NBA partner TNT, does not have a deal in place to continue its partnership with the league. However, WBD CEO David Zaslav has publicly stated he may attempt to use language in the current contract that allows him to match a rival network.\n\nZaslav is most likely to use his matching rights against Amazon, to which the NBA and Amazon could contest in court. Sources tell OutKick the NBA prefers to move on without TNT, a dwindling cable network.\n\nPer the plan, ESPN/ABC will retain the \"A\" package that includes a conference final and NBA Finals each season. ESPN will scale back on the number of NBA games it airs, from 100 to around 80. The network will carry games on Wednesdays and Sundays during the NFL season while continuing to carry Saturday games on ABC. ESPN will broadcast games on Fridays after the NFL season.\n\nIn total, ESPN parent company Disney has agreed to pay the NBA $2.6 billion a year - just below the $2.7 billion it pays for the NFL.\n\nNBC will broadcast games on Tuesdays and then on Sundays after the conclusion of the NFL season. The network will try to capitalize on the success of Sunday Night Football by airing basketball games in that time slot.\n\nFurther, the network will rotate the non-ESPN conference finals every other year with Amazon. NBC's Peacock streaming service will exclusively stream NBA games on Mondays and simulcast all the NBC games.\n\nComcast, the parent company of NBC and Peacock, is expected to pay the NBA $2.5 billion per season.\n\nAmazon has agreed to the \"C\" package for $1.8 billion per year, a price tag the debt-ridden WBD is best suited to match. The streamer will show NBA games on Friday nights and Saturdays and then on Thursday after the final Thursday Night Football game of the season.\n\nAmazon Prime Video will be the home of the newly-created In-Season Tournament.\n\nOverall, the NBA is the obvious winner. Despite losing some 45 percent of its audience since 2012, the new deal increases the NBA's broadcast revenue from $24 billion to $76 billion.\n\nThe question is, will the three partners rue investing heavily in a product that has perpetually waned in popularity over the last decade?\n\nESPN won't. The NBA is critical to ESPN continuing to charge cable providers a record $9.42 a month. The higher rated the network, the more they charge providers.\n\nAnd while the NBA doesn't rate as well as it did, it provides ESPN three-to-four nights a week of inventory, while still out-rating all non-football programming in the advertised coveted demographic of 18-49.\n\nWe are less optimistic about the deals for NBC and Amazon.\n\nThe key for Amazon, or any streaming service, is to increase subscriptions. The NFL has done that for both Prime Video and Peacock. Hence, the NFL's deal with Netflix to air games on Christmas. The idea that viewers will pay extra to stream NBA games when their interest in watching the NBA for free on cable is so substantial.\n\nNBC, a broadcast network, already performs well on Sunday evening, airing newscasts and scripted programming - both of which are much cheaper to produce than NBA games are.\n\nThe NBA averaged just 1.56 million viewers across ABC, ESPN, and TNT this past season.

Discovery's TNT Sports gets a chance to match.\n\nIf what Andrew Marchand from The Athletic/The New York Times is reporting is true, CEO David Zaslav's Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) could find itself either having to match a deal to keep itself in play when it comes to NBA broadcasting rights or prepare itself to be on the outside, looking in at NBC, Amazon's Prime Video, and ESPN as they finalize deals that could reportedly be (according to sources) for 11 seasons and be worth $76 billion. So here's what happens next: once the respective deals are finalized, they head to the league's governors for approval - which is expected to be drama-free, at least at this point. Once the NBC, Prime Video, and ESPN contracts are finished, they head on over to TNT Sports - and that's where it could get interesting.\n\nOnce WBD has the contracts, they have five days to either match the offers that are in front of them or take a pass. If WBD passes, the NBA, NBC, Prime Video, and ESPN have a chance to formally announce the news and enjoy some headline attention before NBC's Summer Olympics coverage kicks off. Zaslav has gone on record as expressing a willingness to match the offers that the NBA has received, with reports that WBD's legal team has been going through the existing contract for any language that could keep the company in the hunt for broadcast rights.\n\nThough both the NBA and TNT Sports declined to comment on Marchand's reporting, the three new deals (if approved) would see the NBA spotlighted in national telecasts nearly seven days a week. In terms of when games will air, Prime Video is expected to shift its Thursday focus to the NBA after the \"Thursday Night Football\" season and will also air games predominantly on Friday nights and Saturdays. The same idea is in play with NBC, with Sunday nights shifting to the NBA after the \"Sunday Night Football\" season and Tuesdays earmarked for games. NBCUniversal streaming service Peacock is eyeing exclusive games on Mondays (and simulcasting all of NBC's games).\n\nAs for ESPN, it would see the number of regular-season games it airs drop \"from around 100 now to the range of 80,\" according to the report. During the NFL season, ESPN will air games on Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays (with its Saturday night game part of a special ABC window) - adding Friday to the lineup after the NFL season wraps. NBC, Prime Video, and ESPN would all have a piece of the playoff pie. Prime Video would stream the In-Season Tournament and alternate with NBC for the conference finals. ESPN would have a conference final and the NBA Finals during each season of the deal.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ray_flook@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Ray Flook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

According to The Athletic, though, TNT Sports may still try to use contractual language to keep its rights. At the Sun Valley Conference in Idaho, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav told reporters, \"We have a matching right.\" The Athletic wrote, \"If Zaslav goes through with that, he is expected to target Amazon's package.\"\n\nRight now, though, sources have told Front Office Sports that TNT has no contacts in front of it to match yet. At that point, Zaslav's TNT will have roughly five days to match one of the offers -- or wave the NBA goodbye after a 40-year relationship.\n\nThe new deals represent an enormous increase from the league's agreements, which paid $2.7 billion annually. Starting in 2025-26, the league will broadcast games across ESPN -- the lone incumbent outlet to retain its rights -- along with NBC and Amazon, the latter of which is a streaming deal.\n\nIf the agreement does go through, TNT's beloved Inside the NBA could be in jeopardy. Charles Barkley, the show's star, has claimed he will retire with the rights up in the air.\n\nWhen the deals are finally complete -- The Athletic reports that if TNT doesn't exercise it rights, the deals could be formally announced before the Olympics begin July 26 -- Adam Silver will turn his attention toward expansion. Las Vegas and Seattle are long rumored to be markets on Silver's radar. The enormous influx of revenue -- more than double the previous agreement -- will also benefit players, who receive 51% of basketball-related revenue per the collective bargaining agreement. The Athletic's projections have the maximum salary passing $100 million annually by the beginning of the next decade.\n\nThe reported deals come two years after Zaslav infamously said, \"We don't have to have the NBA.\" Zaslav has since walked back the comments, but it will be another line on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 mostly marked by consistent cost-cutting.\n\nCharles Barkley, TNT's biggest star, blasted Zaslav for his handling of the situation. He recently suggested that his production company could simply hire the cast of Inside and sell the show back to NBC or Amazon.\n\nIf Barkley doesn't retire, he has a clause in his contract allowing him to test the market should WBD lose the NBA and will have a slew of suitors, while Shaquille O'Neal and Kenny Smith could also have options elsewhere. Longtime host Ernie Johnson has deep ties to TNT, including his father, Ernie Sr., who also worked for the network, and would be the hardest to lure elsewhere; he may be contractually tied to WBD.\n\nNBC's parent company, NBCUniversal, paid a pretty penny to reunite the network with the league, with a reported offer of $2.5 billion per year. NBC had the league's premier package from 1990 to 2002, broadcasting Michael Jordan's entire championship run with the Bulls. NBC has long been rumored to want back in on the NBA and has two natural broadcasters to assume the reins in Mike Tirico and Noah Eagle.\n\nThe WNBA would also like to double its previous deal. Previous FOS reporting suggested that the WNBA could break off from the NBA and negotiate its own deal, but at the league's draft in April, commissioner Cathy Engelbert kept her cards close to the vest.\n\n\"I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year,\" Engelbert said. \"I think Adam uses the quote of 320 [days]. ... I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that.

The deal worth $76 billion will extend for 11 seasons, the report said, citing executives with direct knowledge of the deals. The new agreement, which is more than three times its current deal, comes as sports becomes a powerful draw for media companies trying to expand premium viewership. Disney's ESPN and ABC, and Warner Bros Discovery's TNT sports have been the league's two primary partners from 2002 and 1984, respectively. But media reports have said NBA has been looking to bring in new partners to maximize returns and more than double the deal value. NBA has always been a star-driven sport with talents like Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal dominating the games and viewership. NBC, ESPN, Amazon and NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Shailesh Kuber)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Discovery.\n\nThe finalized terms, reported Wednesday by The Athletic, are not being announced immediately, according to a person familiar with the matter, but all the parties have come to terms on pacts that will spread NBA games to NBC and Peacock as well as Prime Video -- new roosts for the sport -- as well as ESPN and its associated properties. The NBA did not immediately respond to a query seeking comment and NBCU, Amazon and ESPN declined to make executives available for comment.\n\nThe agreements will have to be approved by the league's board of governors, this person says, but the ratification at this point appears nearly certain.\n\nCurrent NBA media rights are held by Disney and Warner, but the contract behind them lapses after the 2024-2025 season. Warner has maintained that its current deal gives it the ability to offer to \"match\" a new package of the games it currently shows, and the company has held out hopes of securing a fourth package of games. Such a concept is unlikely because all of the NBA's national telecasts are accounted for in deals with the other three companies.\n\nThe NBA, like the NFL before it, has been looking to strike long-term deals that reflect the value of sports in the current media ecosystem. In a fast-growing era of streaming video, sports represent one of the few genres that continue to lure the large, simultaneous crowds that advertisers, distributors and the leagues themselves crave. Disney could pay approximately $2.6 billion per year under a new 11-year contract for a smaller passel of games than it currently enjoys, according to people familiar with the talks. Amazon could pay around $1.8 billion per year for a new package that would give the NBA a new foothold with a major streaming platform that has already expanded the NFL's reach among broadband audiences. And NBCU could pay around $2.5 billion per year.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The NBA has agreed to terms on its new media deal, an 11-year agreement worth $76 billion that assures player salaries will continue rising for the foreseeable future and one that will surely change how some viewers access the game for years to come.\n\nThe NBA has agreed to terms on its new media deal, an 11-year agreement worth $76 billion that assures player salaries will continue rising for the foreseeable future and one that will surely change how some viewers access the game for years to come.\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press that the networks have the terms sheets, with the next step being for the league's board of governors to approve the contracts.\n\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Wednesday because they weren't at liberty to discuss such impending matters.\n\nThe deal, which set NBA records for both its length and total value, goes into effect for the 2025-26 season. Games will continue being aired on ESPN and ABC, and now some will be going to NBC and Amazon Prime. TNT Sports, which has been part of the league's broadcasting family since the 1980s, could be on its way out, but has five days to match one of the deals.\n\nThe five-day clock would begin once the league sends the finished contracts to TNT.\n\nThe Athletic was the first to report on the contracts.\n\nIn the short term, the deal almost certainly means the league's salary cap will rise 10% annually -- the maximum allowed by the terms of the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement between the NBA and its players. That means players like Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dallas' Luka Doncic could be making around $80 million in the 2030-31 season and raises at least some possibility that top players may be earning somewhere near $100 million per season by the mid-2030s.\n\nIt also clears the way for the next major item on the NBA's to-do list: Expansion.\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver was very clear on the order of his top agenda items in recent seasons, those being preserving labor peace (which was achieved with the new CBA), getting a new media deal (now essentially completed) and then and only then would the league turn its attention toward adding new franchises. Las Vegas and Seattle are typically among the cities most prominently mentioned as top expansion candidates, with others such as Montreal, Vancouver and Kansas City expected to have groups with interest as well.\n\nAs the broadcast rights packages have grown in total value over the last 25 years, so, too, have salaries because of how much that revenue stream ends up fueling the salary cap.\n\nWhen NBC and Turner agreed to a $2.6 billion, four-year deal that started with the 1998-99 season, the salary cap was $30 million per team and the average salary was around $2.5 million. The average salary this season exceeded $10 million per player -- and it's only going to keep going up from here.\n\nWhen that NBC-Turner deal that started a quarter-century ago expired, the next deal -- covering six seasons -- cost ABC, ESPN and Turner about $4.6 billion. The next was a seven-year deal, costing those networks $7.4 billion.\n\nThe current deal, the one that will expire next season, smashed those records -- nine years, nearly $24 billion.\n\nAnd now, that seems like pocket change.\n\nFrom the deal that started in 1998-99 to the one now struck to begin in 2025, the total value has climbed by about 2,800%. Factoring for inflation even between then and now, the value goes up about 1,400%.\n\nAP Sports Writer Joe Reedy contributed from Los Angeles.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_reynolds@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Tim Reynolds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "joe_reedy@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Joe Reedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Rockets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Buena_Vista,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Buena Vista, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake Buena Vista, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

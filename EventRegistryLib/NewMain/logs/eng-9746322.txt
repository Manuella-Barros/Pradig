At the time of his escape, Meade, 31, was serving a 20-year prison sentence for shooting a sheriff in a high-speed car chase.\n\nHe was able to break loose from prison officials while at the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center.

Officials did not elaborate on additional security measures that were taken and it is not clear if Meade was walking on his own or restrained in any way.\n\nThe attack occurred when officials were gearing up to transfer Meade back to prison.

The men were caught and arrested in Twin Falls on March 21 after a short car chase. No shots were fired and no extensive use of force was used during the arrests.\n\nMeade later plead guilty to the charges associated with his escape, including possession of a controlled substance, unlawful possession, introduction or removal of contraband and persistent violator charges relating to the escape.\n\nUmphenour was charged with three counts of assault or battery upon certain personnel, escape by one charged or convicted for a felony, unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and persistent violator and use of a deadly weapon enhancements.\n\nThe officers involved survived the attack.\n\nOnline court records show Umphenour's trial is scheduled for October.\n\nMeade and Umphenour are suspects in the murder of 83-year-old James L Mauney of Juliaetta, Idaho, which police say took place during his escape. That case remains under investigation. Police think the men may have been involved in the death of 72-year-old Gerald \"Don\" Henderson near Orofino.\n\nPolice said they found Meade's handcuffs at the scene of one of the murders.

His sentence Friday runs consecutive to the sentences he was previously serving.\n\nAfter that escape from custody, Meade was charged with two felonies and a misdemeanor -- possession of a controlled substance; escape by one charged, convicted or on probation for a felony; and contraband unlawfully possessed, introduced or removed from correctional facilities -- plus two persistent violator enhancements. Meade pleaded guilty to all charges.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Meade was assisted in the attack by Nicholas Umphenour, who has been charged with three counts of assault or battery upon certain personnel, escape by one charged or convicted for a felony, unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon -- all felonies -- plus persistent violator and use of a deadly weapon enhancements. His trial is scheduled in October, according to online court records.\n\nMeade escaped from custody as correctional officers got ready to bring him back to prison from Saint Alphonsus hospital, which is located at 1055 N Curtis Rd. in Boise. According to Josh Tewalt, the department of correction director, Meade was taken to Saint Alphonsus on March 19 around 9:30 p.m. after engaging in self harm.\n\nJust hours later, around 2:15 a.m., three correctional officers were shot in the ambulance bay of the hospital, near the emergency department. Nicholas Umphenour, who is awaiting trial, shot two of the correctional officers, prosecutors say. A third officer was shot and injured when a fellow police officer mistook him for the shooter and opened fire. All three of the officers survived their injuries.\n\nThe suspects fled the scene in a stolen Honda Civic and drove north through Idaho, encountering 83-year-old James Mauney near Juliaetta -- over 250 miles from Boise. According to police, Mauney and his dogs were driven in Mauney's car to Leland, about 10 miles from Juliaetta, which is where Mauney's body and Meade's Honda Civic getaway car were found.\n\nAccording to a police report, Meade's shackles and Meade's dogs were found in 72-year-old Gerald \"Don\" Henderson's home just outside of Orofino. Henderson was found dead in his home.\n\nThe two men were arrested the afternoon of March 21 in Twin Falls after a brief car chase.\n\nAccording to Idaho State Police, both Meade and Umphenour are being investigated for potential involvement in the two homicides, but the court is currently only addressing the offenses that happened in Ada County.\n\nPrevious reporting from the Associated Press

He has been ordered to serve another 35 years concurrently on other charges, according to Idaho News 6. At the time of his escape, Meade, 31, was serving a 20-year prison sentence for shooting a sheriff in a high-speed car chase.\n\nHe was able to break loose from prison officials while at the Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center. He was seeking medical treatment and had been taken to the hospital around 9.35pm on March 19 after he engaged in \"self-injurious behavior\", The Associated Press reported.\n\nUnder state procedure, unarmed guards stand at each side of a high-risk prisoner while an armed guard follows them. Officials did not elaborate on additional security measures that were taken and it is not clear if Meade was walking on his own or restrained in any way.\n\nThe attack occurred when officials were gearing up to transfer Meade back to prison. Around 2.15am an armed accomplice, said to be Nicholas Umphenour, launched an attack. Three prison officers were shot in the ensuing gunfight and the two men were able to escape in a four-door sedan, later identified as a grey Honda Accord. The men were caught and arrested in Twin Falls on March 21. Both Meade and Umphenour have links to white supremacist gang Aryan Knights.\n\nThe officers involved survived the incident.\n\nMeade later plead guilty to the charges associated with his escape, including possession of a controlled substance, unlawful possession, introduction or removal of contraband and persistent violator charges relating to the escape.\n\nUmphenour was charged with three counts of assault or battery upon certain personnel, escape by one charged or convicted for a felony, unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and persistent violator and use of a deadly weapon enhancements. Online court records show his trial is scheduled for October.\n\nMeade and Umphenour are suspects in the murder of 83-year-old James L Mauney of Juliaetta, Idaho, which police took place during his escape. That case remains under investigation. Police think the men may have been involved in the death of 72-year-old Gerald \"Don\" Henderson near Orofino.\n\nMeade has two face tattoos, including the numbers 1 and 11, which are thought to represent A and K, the first and 11th letters of the alphabet, which supposedly stands for Aryan Knights.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meade_County,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meade County, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Meade County, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda Accord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-harm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Falls,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twin Falls, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Twin Falls, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contraband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(crime)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery (crime)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orofino,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orofino, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orofino, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliaetta,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juliaetta, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Juliaetta, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/19/06/Hospital_Shooting_Prison_Escape_85583.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746322", "eventUri": "eng-9746322", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-19", "textStart": 638, "textEnd": 646}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-21", "textStart": 1373, "textEnd": 1381}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The officer, one of three who were injured during the Boise hospital attack, saw a \"repugnant and repulsive disregard for human life.\"\n\n\"We weren't human to him,\" Lopez told an Ada County courtroom Friday. \"I have loved ones too.\"\n\nYet Lopez still asked 4th Judicial District Judge Nancy Baskin to give Meade the chance for rehabilitation, and the chance to eventually be released from prison.\n\nBaskin said Meade's actions warranted a \"significant\" punishment. The Ada County judge Friday instead sentenced Meade to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 35 years, for five felonies, three of which were related to his escape, including assaulting an officer and an enhancement for causing bodily injury.\n\n\"You are a career criminal,\" Baskin said.\n\nMeade, 32, will start his new prison sentence after he finishes serving his initial sentence for assaulting an officer in Twin Falls. He was also sentenced for possession of a controlled substance and unlawfully introducing contraband into a correctional facility. He's expected to be in prison for at least the next four decades.\n\nNicholas Umphenour, who was accused of conspiring with Meade on the ambush, is expected to face a jury trial in October on six felonies, including several assault charges and a persistent violator enhancement, according to court records. Baskin entered not guilty pleas on his behalf in May after Umphenour stood silent, according to prior Idaho Statesman reporting.\n\nText messages detail escape plans\n\nMeade was taken by three correction officers to Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center for self-inflicted injuries in March. He escaped from custody after 29-year-old Umphenour shot two of the officers as they were loading Meade into a prison van, according to testimony from law enforcement during an April hearing. The third officer was shot and injured by a Boise officer, the police agency said. All of the officers survived.\n\nMeade at the time was serving a minimum 10-year prison sentence at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution south of Boise, and Umphenour had been living in Florida after he was released from prison in January. The men knew each other from prison and are members of a white supremacist prison gang known as the Aryan Knights, according to police and the Idaho Department of Correction.\n\nThe men fled and drove to North Idaho, police said, where they're suspected of killing two men before law enforcement apprehended them near Twin Falls. Police have so far only charged them with one first-degree murder count in Nez Perce County.\n\nAda County Deputy Prosecutor Heather Reilly during Meade's sentencing presented text messages between Umphenour and Meade detailing plans for the escape, which included avenues to secure enough money, discussion about purchasing ammunition and information about the guards who would be carrying weapons. Police obtained the texts from the phone Umphenour tossed from the car during the escape, Reilly said.\n\nIn one text, Umphenour told Meade that he'd kill the officers if he needed to and that it \"depends on them.\" Meade responded by saying they would \"only do it if we have to.\"\n\nWhile Meade didn't pull the trigger, Baskin said he organized the events, even directing Umphenour on which correctional officer to go after first.\n\n\"You are just as liable as the person who actually fired the firearm,\" Baskin told Meade.\n\nReilly on Friday outlined Meade's extensive criminal record, which dates back to his adolescence. In 2010, Meade fled Tennessee before being convicted of grand theft the next year in Twin Falls, Reilly said. He spent five years in prison before being released in 2016 and was charged and convicted the next year for several charges, including assault on an officer.\n\nHad Meade not been convicted of his escape charges, he would have been eligible for parole in 2026.\n\n\"In as little as two years, the defendant was in the position of taking advantage of rehabilitative opportunities within Idaho Department of Correction and earning his way onto parole,\" Reilly said. \"Not only did he not take advantage of that opportunity, he did the exact opposite.\"\n\nMeade's attorneys didn't present any testimony or evidence during the sentencing.\n\n'This truly was an ambush'\n\nThe sentencing Friday also provided new details about the high-profile escape that led to a 36-hour statewide manhunt.\n\nReilly said Meade faked his medical injury so that he'd be escorted to the hospital. Meade claimed that he'd taken somebody else's medication, swallowed razor blades and injured himself on his hand, Reilly said. But once they arrived at the hospital, Meade refused treatment from the medical staff because he knew Umphenour was in the parking lot.\n\n\"All of it was fake, all of it was contrived,\" Reilly said.\n\nJust after 2 a.m. March 20, Meade was being escorted out of the hospital's emergency room department by the correction officers into the ambulance bay, where the prison van was located, according to prior testimony from law enforcement.\n\nTypically, two officers accompany a prisoner on medical visits, but because of Meade's security level, three officers accompanied him, the Idaho Department of Correction previously said. Meade was restrained on his legs, wrists and waist.\n\nAs officers were bringing Meade to the van, Umphenour shot at them from behind, Reilly said. Lopez was the only armed officer and didn't have a chance to pull his weapon out before Umphenour shot him from behind in the glute and clavicle area, according to the prosecutor. Lopez couldn't see where the rounds were coming from and was concerned about shooting an innocent bystander, since they were in the range of the emergency room doors, Reilly added. The other officer was shot in the abdomen.\n\n\"This truly was an ambush,\" Reilly said.\n\nBoise Officer Wayne Anderson accidentally injured a third correction officer in the eye with either a bullet or shrapnel. Reilly said the correction officer was holding Lopez's gun in the hospital when Anderson responded to an \"active shooting\" and him with the weapon.\n\nReilly blamed Umphenour and Meade for what happened, attributing it to the chaos they created.\n\n\"The defendant was willing to take the lives of at least three correction officers during his escape and anyone else who got in his way,\" Reilly said. \"It's frankly a miracle that he's not facing a triple homicide along with Umphenour in Ada County.\"\n\nMeade, Umphenour charged with murder\n\nMeade will now likely be moved to the Nez Perce County Jail to face his first-degree murder charge after a Nez Perce grand jury indicted him and Umphenour in the death of James Mauney, an 83-year-old man in Juliaetta, north of Lewiston.\n\nMeade and Umphenour encountered Mauney in North Idaho while he was walking his dogs, according to Idaho State Police. His body was later found in a desolate area.\n\nThat same day, deputies from neighboring Clearwater County found the body of Gerald \"Don\" Henderson, 72, in his cabin outside of Orofino. Police said shackles that belonged to Meade, along with Mauney's dogs, were found in the cabin.\n\n\"Nez Perce County isn't expecting any updates until the defendants are transported and appear in our court,\" Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman previously told the Statesman.\n\nPolice said Meade and Umphenour are also suspected of killing Henderson but have not been charged yet in that death.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_brizee@idahostatesman.com", "name": "Alex Brizee", "type": "author",

He even had to have an injection to relieve pain in his finger and foot. Despite this, he managed to win the Madrid Open on Sunday, beating Felix Auger-Aliassime 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 to claim his second title of the year despite battling illness.\n\nThe Russian world number eight said he was \"almost dead every day\". He could barely sleep during the week-long tournament in Spain. It was his second Masters 1000 victory.\n\nRublev came from a set down to defeat his Canadian opponent, having lost four matches in a row before arriving in the Spanish capital. The 26-year-old had won the Hong Kong Open in January,but had struggled since then. In Madrid, however, he overcame that to win by dropping just one set en route to a tense final.\n\n\"I think it was an incredible match. Felix deserved to win today as much as I did and we put up a great fight together. I think the most important thing was that the crowd enjoyed it,\" Rublev said on court. \"That's how we play, you can't have both of us winning.\"\n\nRublev, who takes the crown in Madrid from two-time champion Carlos Alcaraz, whom he beat in the quarter-finals. Rublev admitted that he played despite feeling unwell at times and praised his doctors for helping him. \"You wouldn't think I could win a title if you knew what I went through in the last nine days,\" he said. \"I was almost dead every day, I didn't sleep at night, the last three, four days I didn't sleep.\"\n\nAuger-Aliassime reached the final after his semi-final opponent Jiri Lehecka retired with an injury. His quarter-final opponent Jannik Sinner withdrew with a hip injury. Injuries have certainly been the story of the last few weeks. However, the 23-year-old Canadian, ranked 35th in the world, gave it his all in his first Masters 1000 final.\n\nThe match between Rublev and Auger-Aliassime was tense and close. Rublev broke back when Auger-Aliassime dropped a break and went 4-3 up. The Russian saved a set point to make it 5-4, but Auger-Aliassime broke at the second opportunity with a forehand down the line. In the second set, after Rublev had saved a break point, the Canadian held at 3-3 with a brilliant drop shot.\n\nThey stayed on serve until the twelfth game, when Rublev had two set points, the second of which he converted to take the match to a decisive third set. Auger-Aliassime produced huge serves to get himself out of trouble. He hit 14 aces in the match to Rublev's seven.\n\nHowever, Rublev dropped just three points on serve in the third set, while Auger-Aliassime trailed in every service game, but fought back until the decisive twelfth game. Auger-Aliassime double-faulted to give Rublev the title and the Russian fell to the floor in celebration.\n\nRublev is going to see the doctors to get a full analysis to try and find out what's causing the physical discomfort that's preventing him from feeling well. However, they haven't been able to slow him down.

consecutive matches before arriving in the Spanish capital but came from a set down to beat his Canadian opponent.\n\nThe 26-year-old triumphed at the Hong Kong Open in January but struggled since before turning around his form in Madrid, dropping just one set on the way to what proved a tense final.\n\nALSO READ: Real Madrid's Vinicius Jr. takes DIG at Barcelona defender after winning LaLiga title\n\n\"I think it was an incredible match, Felix deserved (in) the same way as me to win today and we showed a great battle together, I think the most important thing was that the people enjoyed it,\" said Rublev on court. \"Our sport is like this, we cannot have both winners.\"\n\nRublev, who takes the Madrid crown from double champion Carlos Alcaraz whom he beat in the quarter-finals, said he had played despite feeling ill at times this week and hailed his doctors for helping him through.\n\n\"If you knew what I had been through in the past nine days you would not imagine that I would be able to win a title,\" he added. \"I was almost dead every day, I was not sleeping at night -- the last three, four days I didn't sleep.\"\n\nAuger-Aliassime reached the final after his opponent Jiri Lehecka retired hurt in the semi-finals and quarter-final opponent Jannik Sinner withdrew with a hip injury, with the ATP draw at the clay-court tournament struck by misfortune.\n\nHowever the 23-year-old Canadian, ranked 35th in the world, gave everything he had in his first Masters 1000 final appearance.\n\nAuger-Aliassime started superbly by breaking to love in the first game and then again in the fifth game for a 4-1 lead.\n\nRublev recovered a break when Auger-Aliassime went long, and consolidated for a 4-3 deficit.\n\nThe Russian saved a set point to hold for 5-4 down but Auger-Aliassime clinched it at the second opportunity with a forehand down the line.\n\nIn the second set the Canadian held for 3-3 with a brilliant drop shot after Rublev spurned a break point.\n\nThey stayed on serve until the 12th game when Rublev brought up two set points, converting the second to take it to a deciding third set.\n\nRublev raced through his service games and put heavy pressure on his opponent's serve, forcing a break point in the second game and two more in the fourth, none of which he could take.\n\nAuger-Aliassime produced huge serves to fight his way out of tough spots, racking up 14 aces in the match to Rublev's seven.\n\nHowever Rublev dropped just three points on his serve in the third set, while Auger-Aliassime trailed in all of his service games but always battled back, until the decisive 12th game.\n\nAuger-Aliassime double-faulted to hand Rublev the title, with the Russian falling to the floor in delight.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com",

He has won four straight in Spain's capital, including against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Rublev said. \"It's the good thing about sports, about tennis. One week can change everything, you have to remember that ... because you can't perform always at 100%, so it is normal there will be ups and downs.\"\n\nRublev is seeking his 16th career title and his second of the season after winning Hong Kong in January. He has a 5-1 record against Auger-Aliassime, including a win in their sole matchup on clay.\n\nLehecka wept -- and smashed his racket on the ground -- when he called it quits due to an apparent back injury. Auger-Aliassime hugged him at the net to show his support for the 31st-ranked Czech, who knocked out Rafael Nadal on Wednesday.\n\nThis was the third time at the tournament that Auger-Aliassime moved on after his opponent had physical problems. His second-round opponent, Jakub Mensik, retired in their second set, and in the quarterfinals top-seeded Jannik Sinner said he couldn't play due to a hip injury and gave Auger-Aliassime a walkover. The 35th-ranked Canadian, who beat Casper Ruud in the round-of-16, will be seeking his sixth career title.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Auger-Aliassime said. \"It's kind of a weird situation to be in on my part. It's never happened to me in my career, a withdrawal or a walkover or retirement of this sort, and back-to-back like this.\n\n\"I have a lot of empathy for Jiri, and I can't do anything but try to prepare for Sunday.\"\n\nThe men's side has been hard hit by injuries and fitness concerns.\n\nNovak Djokovic withdrew before the tournament. In addition to Sinner, Mensik, and Lehecka, Daniil Medvedev retired in the quarterfinals; Alcaraz was hampered by a sore right arm before he fell to Rublev; and Nadal did what he could before bowing out of what was likely his last appearance in his home country.\n\nFritz, ranked 13th, entered the match with a 5-3 record against Rublev.\n\nAfter an evenly contested start, Rublev pounced by breaking Fritz from love on his last service game of the first set. He remained in control. Fritz hit seven aces -- to Rublev's five -- but landed only 55% of his first serves. Rublev landed 75% of his first serves and struck 20 winners to Fritz's 16.\n\n\"I could have played a lot better today,\" Fritz said. \"A lot of credit to Andrey. He served really well, made lots of first serves, in good spots, too. He pulled me off the court.\"\n\nOn Saturday, top-ranked Iga Swiatek will face No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in a repeat of last year's women's final won by Sabalenka.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.mb.com.ph/production/AP_24124537773717_0bea6896d3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 67, "textEnd": 72}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 358, "textEnd": 363}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

I don't know if it's ever happened to a player before, it's kind of a weird situation to be in on my part,\" said a stunned Auger-Aliassime, who is through to the first Masters final of his career by playing just three completed matches.\n\nLehecka felt something in his back as he attempted a serve early in the match and took an eight-minute off-court medical timeout before play resumed at 3-3.\n\nIt was all over three points later as Lehecka fell to the ground in pain, bringing the match to an abrupt end.\n\n\"I couldn't believe what was happening when I saw that his back blocked on him.

He has won four straight in Spain's capital, including against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Rublev said. \"It's the good thing about sports, about tennis. One week can change everything, you have to remember that ... because you can't perform always at 100%, so it is normal there will be ups and downs.\"\n\nRublev is seeking his 16th career title and his second of the season after winning Hong Kong in January. He has a 5-1 record against Auger-Aliassime, including a win in their sole matchup on clay.\n\nLehecka wept -- and smashed his racket on the ground -- when he called it quits due to an apparent back injury. Auger-Aliassime hugged him at the net to show his support for the 31st-ranked Czech, who knocked out Rafael Nadal on Wednesday.\n\nThis was the third time at the tournament that Auger-Aliassime moved on after his opponent had physical problems. His second-round opponent, Jakub Mensik, retired in their second set, and in the quarterfinals top-seeded Jannik Sinner said he couldn't play due to a hip injury and gave Auger-Aliassime a walkover. The 35th-ranked Canadian, who beat Casper Ruud in the round-of-16, will be seeking his sixth career title.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Auger-Aliassime said. \"It's kind of a weird situation to be in on my part. It's never happened to me in my career, a withdrawal or a walkover or retirement of this sort, and back-to-back like this.\n\n\"I have a lot of empathy for Jiri, and I can't do anything but try to prepare for Sunday.\"\n\nThe men's side has been hard hit by injuries and fitness concerns.\n\nNovak Djokovic withdrew before the tournament. In addition to Sinner, Mensik, and Lehecka, Daniil Medvedev retired in the quarterfinals; Alcaraz was hampered by a sore right arm before he fell to Rublev; and Nadal did what he could before bowing out of what was likely his last appearance in his home country.\n\nFritz, ranked 13th, entered the match with a 5-3 record against Rublev.\n\nAfter an evenly contested start, Rublev pounced by breaking Fritz from love on his last service game of the first set. He remained in control. Fritz hit seven aces -- to Rublev's five -- but landed only 55% of his first serves. Rublev landed 75% of his first serves and struck 20 winners to Fritz's 16.\n\n\"I could have played a lot better today,\" Fritz said. \"A lot of credit to Andrey. He served really well, made lots of first serves, in good spots, too. He pulled me off the court.\"\n\nOn Saturday, top-ranked Iga Swiatek will face No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in a repeat of last year's women's final won by Sabalenka.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/download-2024-05-04t091806.910_16:9-171479458421116_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

They were magical and did some tricky things that I was somehow able to play. I've never seen this in my life. I would say this is the proudest title of my career. I haven't slept well for the past three to four days.\n\nAuger-Aliassime had advanced to the final when three of his five opponents in Madrid gave him walkovers, including top seed Jannik Sinner, who withdrew before their quarter-final with an injury.\n\nQuestions about whether the unseeded Canadian deserved to be in the final were put to rest in the opening set when he clinically dismantled Rublev's serve. Rublev had the worst possible start as two double faults broke him in the first game of the match and the Russian soon found himself 4-1 down as Auger-Aliassime fired several winners.\n\nThe seventh seed fought back and managed to break Auger-Aliassime, but the Canadian was in good control by then and served well to make the most of his strong forehand before closing the opening set on serve with a resounding winner at the net . But Rublev, who had knocked out second seed and home favorite Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, was much more aggressive with his shots in the second set, which involved serving.\n\nThe Russian also found his range on his first serve, continually putting Auger-Aliassime in the background before grabbing the decisive break when leading 6-5 to force a decider.\n\nIt was also a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in the last set, which was accompanied by serving until Rublev broke again at 6-5. Auger-Aliassime was under pressure as he served to stay in the match, but he committed two double faults, the second handing the title to Rublev in an anticlimax at the end of the final.\n\nCongratulations Andrey, very deserved winner. Congratulations to you and your team. I tried to the end, said Auger-Aliassime.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1a5cf08be654003e8efed3dba8aa7eb5ed3e73d/0_173_5152_3092/master/5152.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5bf361bd4da3bd24c8d36340a9526fe0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

However, his run to the title contest was slightly easier as three of his opponent either withdrew before their match or retired mid-way through.\n\nAuger-Aliassime began his campaign against Yoshihito Nishioka and came back from a set down to better the Japanese player 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. The Canadian was much more in sync against his next opponent, No. 19 seed Adrian Mannarino, as he defeated the veteran Frenchman 6-0, 6-4.\n\nThis set up a third-round clash against Czech prodigy Jakub Mensik. Auger-Aliassime easily raced past Mensik in the first set. Unfortunately, the 18-year-old retired from the match one game into the second set. Reigning Barcelona Open champion Casper Ruud awaited the Canadian in the fourth round.\n\nIn his best performance at the tournament, Felix Auger-Aliassime dispatched the No. 5 seed Ruud, a pre-tournament favorite, 6-4, 7-5 to book his berth in the quarterfinals, where he was drawn against top seed Jannik Sinner. However, the match did not take place as the Italian withdrew from the tournament, citing a hip injury.\n\nThis allowed Auger-Aliassime to enter his third Masters-1000 semifinal, first on clay. His semifinal match against No. 30 seed Jiri Lehecka took place on April 3. After both men held their serve in the first six games of the first set, Lehecka grabbed his lower back in pain. While he returned to play the next game, the Czech threw in the towel after three points and handed Auger-Aliassime a ticket to the final.\n\nThis meant that the former US Open semifinalist played only three completed matches out of six en route to the title contest. In terms of ATP points, Auger-Aliassime received a total of 500 points (50 from his third-round match against Mensik, 200 from his quarterfinal match against Sinner, and 250 from the semifinal against Lehecka) as a result of his opponent's withdrawals/retirement.\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime faces Andrey Rublev in his first tour final of 2024\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime will now face Andrey Rublev in the 2024 Madrid Open final. This match is a big opportunity for both players vying to return to the winner's circle on the ATP Tour. Auger-Aliassime, currently ranked World No. 35, needed a big performance at a massive tournament like the Madrid Open to regain confidence after a middling start to the season.\n\nThe former World No. 6 did not make any significant mark on the 2024 ATP Tour, with his best performance before Madrid being a semifinal finish at the ATP 250 Montpellier Open in early February. A combination of steady performance and good luck has seen the 23-year-old progress to his first ATP Tour final since October 2023.\n\nHis final opponent in Caja Magica will be Andrey Rublev, another player who had been out of form coming into the tournament. The Russian lost four matches in straight sets before his campaign in Madrid and would be relieved to have found his form again.\n\nRublev is seeded seventh and ousted the likes of two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz to reach his fifth Masters-1000 final. The former Monte-Carlo Masters champion would be the firm favorite to take home his second title at this level.\n\nAuger-Aliassime is assured of a return to the top 20 of the ATP Rankings regardless of the result of the Madrid summit clash. If he manages to better Rublev, the Canadian will jump to World No. 17.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "naman_trivedi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Naman Trivedi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihito_Nishioka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshihito Nishioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mannarino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Mannarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_250", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 250"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_M\u00e1gica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caja M\u00e1gica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte-Carlo Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/2154c-17147699774936-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1301, "textEnd": 1308}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

An illness-ridden Andrey Rublev flaunted his magnificent powers of recovery as he battled back from a set down to beat Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final of the Madrid Open on Sunday.\n\nWith two hours and 48 minutes gone in a marathon three-setter, Rublev triumphed 4-6 7-5 7-5 to conquer Madrid for the first time and win just his second ATP 1000 crown, following up last year's Monte-Carlo success.\n\nThe Russian seventh seed had been plagued by a bug throughout his clay campaign in the Spanish capital but had earned impressive scalps over Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz to set up a date with Auger-Aliassime.\n\nRublev's Canadian foe only completed 50% of his matches - earning a walkover win over Jannik Sinner and also seeing Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka retire from previous matches - and he was evidently the fresher man in the opening exchanges.\n\nRublev served two double faults on his first two points as Auger-Aliassime broke at the first time of asking before repeating the trick for a 4-1 lead, and even though Rublev earned one break back, he could not find the coveted second.\n\nHowever, the seventh seed started swinging some venomous cross-court attempts as the match wore on and brought up two set points on the Auger-Aliassime serve in the next set, taking his second chance to take the final the distance.\n\nRublev triumphs in injury-hit tournament\n\nBy this point, Rublev had dusted off the cobwebs and was firmly on top against Auger-Aliassime, and the final appropriately ended how it started, with the Canadian double-faulting on Rublev's first match point before the 26-year-old collapsed onto the clay in euphoria.\n\nThe Russian spared a word for the medical staff and catering team during his victory speech, as well as thanking his coach for multiple trips to the pharmacy, as he emerged victorious in a tournament that will not be fondly remembered by the ATP's top dogs.\n\nAlready missing Novak Djokovic, the man who replaced the Serbian as top seed - Australian Open champion Sinner - pulled out of his quarter-final with Auger-Aliassime before it was scheduled to begin due to a hip injury, which will also force him to sit out the imminent Italian Open in his homeland.\n\nWhile Alcaraz did complete his quarter-final with Rublev, his vicious forehand was not 100% operational due to the forearm injury which has seen him relinquish his Rome dreams too, and third seed Daniil Medvedev had to retire from his quarter-final with Lehecka before the Czech suffered the same fate.\n\nTwo weeks on from the start of the tournament, all of the top three seeds are on the sidelines in a worrying turn of events before the French Open, but Rublev could now hardly be in a better place.\n\nThe Russian now prepares to enter the Italian Open as the fourth seed before turning his attention to Roland-Garros, where he will finally endeavour to end his Grand Slam quarter-final curse, having competed in 10 such matches without ever reaching the final four.\n\nID:542998:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4483:No Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/18/andrey-rublev_1.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The Canadian earned a second break to extend his lead to 4-1, only for Rublev to fight back and get one back. However, the 23-year-old remained solid to seal the set without further hiccups, taking it 6-4.\n\nThe second set was far closer, with the duo holding serve back-to-back until 6-5. However, when serving to stay in the set, Auger-Aliassime faltered, handing Rublev the set, 7-5. With all to play for in the decider, the Russian got the first opening, leading 40-15 on Auger-Aliassime's second service game.\n\nThe Canadian, though, served two big first serves to save both break points and held his serve with service winners to level things at 2-2. Quite concerningly, he then had to call the on-site physio for a short medical treatment during changeovers but held serve for 4-4.\n\nRublev held serve to push the physically struggling 23-year-old in to a corner, who responded with a dominant serving performance to make it 5-5. Forced to serve again to stay in the match, though, Aliassime faltered, losing the set 7-5 to hand the Russian his second Masters 1000 title. Previously, Rublev had won the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters, beating Holger Rune in the final.\n\nEn route the final, Auger-Aliassime beat the likes of Casper Ruud, Adrian Mannarino and Daniil Medvedev (retirement). The Canadian was set to face Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals, but the Italian withdrew ahead of the clash due to a hip injury.\n\nMeanwhile, Rublev battled past the likes of Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz to reach the championship round.\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime and Andrey Rublev in action next at Italian Open 2024\n\nFollowing their clash in the final of the 2024 Madrid Open, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Andrey Rublev are scheduled to be in action next at the Italian Open next week.\n\nThey are expected to be joined by the likes of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Holger Rune, while World No. 2 Jannik Sinner and World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz have announced their withdrawal due to injury.\n\nDaniil Medvedev is the defending champion in Rome, but it's not clear whether the Russian will participate, as he's also nursing an injury that made him retire in Madrid this week.\n\nIn the 2023 edition of the Italian Open, Felix Auger-Aliassime exited in the second round, losing to Alexei Popyrin. Rublev, meanwhile, progressed as far as the fourth round before falling to Yannick Hanfmann.\n\nFollowing the Italian Open, the duo, along with the rest of the tour, will move to Paris for the French Open. Rublev and Auger-Aliassime had poor results at the Grand Slam last year, with the former losing in the third round (losing to Lorenzo Sonego), while Auger-Aliassime bowed out in the first round (losing to Fabio Fognini).", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shyam_kamal@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Shyam Kamal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Monte-Carlo_Masters_\u2013_Singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 Monte-Carlo Masters \u2013 Singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mannarino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Mannarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yannick_Hanfmann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yannick Hanfmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Fognini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fabio Fognini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Sonego", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lorenzo Sonego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Popyrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexei Popyrin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/1d9a1-17149374892712-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He has won four straight in Spain's capital, including against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Rublev said. \"It's the good thing about sports, about tennis. One week can change everything, you have to remember that ... because you can't perform always at 100%, so it is normal there will be ups and downs.\"\n\nRublev is seeking his 16th career title and his second of the season after winning Hong Kong in January.\n\nLehecka wept -- - and smashed his racket on the ground -- when he called it quits due to an apparent injury.

He was also seeking his second title of the season, and eighth of his career. He won Delray Beach in February.\n\nAfter an evenly contested start, Rublev pounced by breaking Fritz from love on his last service game of the first set. He remained in control.

Before completing a win over Auger-Aliassime, Rublev endured a grueling battle as he spent two hours and 48 minutes on the court.\n\nTo beat Auger-Aliassime, Rublev needed to leave a lot both mentally and physically. But there wouldn't be anything particularly surprising in Rublev edging out Auger-Aliassime in a nearly three-hour battle if not for a stunning revelation made by the Russian.\n\nAfter his win, 26-year-old Rublev revealed that he battled multiple issues in Madrid and that he was close to withdrawing from the tournament. That's when Rublev called the doctors in Madrid \"magicians\" and credited them for putting him in a position to play.\n\n\"I was. There were a few issues I couldn't fix. I have to give full credit to the doctors. They're magicians. They were doing some tricky things.. Somehow I was able to at least play. I've never seen this in my life. They're the best so far out of all the ones I've had on tour,\" Rublev said.\n\nAt one point, one of Rublev's toes got so inflamed that it was almost impossible for him to put on his shoes. But the doctors figured out a solution as Rublev played the tournament with his foot anesthetized.\n\n\"They were doing kind of anaesthesia in my [toe] because my [toe] somehow get inflamed and start to be double bigger and all the pressure start to be on the bone, and the pressure on the bone, when you have pressure on the bone, you cannot even put your feet inside the shoe,\" Rublev revealed.\n\n\"The feeling is similar to when it's broken, I guess. So that's why they were putting anaesthesia for me to not feel it. Like I say, at least I was able to play without thinking.\"\n\nNot only that Rublev battled a foot issue in Madrid, but he was also dealing with a myserious illness. When revealing that, Rublev shared that his throat was \"blocked\" and that it was almost \"impossible to eat,\" which also led to nasty headaches.\n\n\"I'm still sick from everything. I'm still sick, and tomorrow I guess I will go to the hospital for full check. Don't know exactly what's going on, because I have been sick already for eight, nine days, and this is not normal. The same, like, not really improvements, which is strange, because normally all my life, if I was sick, it's two, three days, maximum. Still maybe fever but nothing special. This time, first time I feel that worst in my life,\" Rublev said.\n\n\"Tomorrow we will find out what exactly it is or if it's angina? I don't know if you know it, or if it's some virus, but the throat is completely blocked. My throat, for nine days, it's impossible to swallow, impossible to eat and headache full because of it.\"\n\nWhen the match started, Rublev wasn't looking great on the court as he quickly found himself down by two breaks. While Rublev managed to get one break back, Auger-Aliassime kept his second break and that was enough for the Canadian to seal the opener.\n\nAfter three breaks of serve in the first set, the first and lone break points of the second set came in the 12th game - the game in which Auger-Aliassime was serving to stay in the set. On his second break point - which was at the same time a set point - Rublev converted to send the match into a decider.\n\nIn the third set, Rublev was putting major pressure on Auger-Aliassime's serve but he just wasn't finding a way to break. After missing two break points in the second game and two more in the fourth game, Rublev missed another in the eighth game.\n\nBut just like in the second set, Rublev managed to break Auger-Aliassime while 6-5 up and complete his win.\n\nAfter the final, Rublev acknowledged Auger-Aliassime's performance and classily said the Canadian should also feel like a winner.\n\n\"I think it was an incredible match, Felix deserved (in) the same way as me to win today and we showed a great battle together, I think the most important thing was that the people enjoyed it. Our sport is like this, we cannot have both winners,\" Rublev said after beating Auger-Aliassime.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anesthesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinniped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148416.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

For 26-year-old Rublev, delivering an on-court meldown and outburst wasn't anything new but this time it was by far the most stunning he had.\n\nAfter the incident and drawing very negative attention to himself, Rublev appeared to be mentally impacted by everything that happened and lost four of his next five matches before coming to Madrid. But in Madrid over the last 10 days, Rublev has been looking much better and that was evident again in the semifinal, when he took on Taylor Fritz and beat the 13th-ranked American 6-4 6-3.\n\nAgainst Fritz, Rublev dropped his serve in the very first game of the match. But he didn't panic and quickly bounced back.\n\n\"I started really tight. I missed a couple of returns, a couple of easy shots, but it is part of sport and part of tennis. When he broke me, I thought, 'OK, it is only the beginning, we have a long set and we will see. Maybe he will also not start well on his serve,'\" Rublev said of beating Fritz.\n\n\"In the end, I think in the first three points he didn't hit a first serve, so I was able to win and it was 0/30. On one break point I played well, and somehow it was 1-1. Then the match was equal until the end of the set.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, for years world No. 8 Rublev has been known as someone who can lost it at times on the court and deliver an outburst. But in the past, Rublev would always take out his frustration on himself or on his racket - never on someone else. That's why his Dubai outburst was something different.\n\nThe Dubai situation wasn't something that Rublev would be proud of but now it seems that it was a wake-up call that the 26-year-old Russian needed.\n\n\"I had many, many, how you say, warnings in life already that show me that I need to be more calm. It was not only with Dubai but was in general many times that I was close to doing something not good, and I was lucky that everything went well,\" Rublev said after reaching the Madrid final.\n\n\"I had a lot of warnings already to be more calm, so I don't know. I would like to think that it's more that I'm improving, and not only because of the 'warnings.' I would like to believe that it's me who is the one who is improving. Doesn't matter the situations that I had.\"\n\nWhile Rublev progressed into the Madrid final with a win over Fritz, Auger-Aliassime sealed a final ticket at Caja Magica after Jiri Lehecka was forced to retire from their semifinal match just a couple of games into it due to an injury.\n\nWhen Rublev and 23-year-old Auger-Aliassime meet in the Madrid final, they will be taking on each other for the sixth time in their careers. So far, Rublev has had much more success in their meetings, beating Auger-Aliassime four times and losing just once.\n\nHowever, it is not that Rublev has been dominant against Auger-Aliassime as literally all of his wins against the Canadian were tight contests. After sealing a 6-4 6-7 (4) 6-3 win over Auger-Aliassime in their first meeting in 2018 Umag, Rublev also won their second in 2020 Adelaide with a 7-6 (5) 6-7 (7) 6-4 scoreline.\n\nIn their third meeting, Auger-Aliassime finally clinched his first win over Rublev after beating the Russian 6-7 (5) 6-4 6-2 in 2022 Rotterdam.\n\nThat same year, Rublev edged out Auger-Aliassime 7-5 7-6 (4) in Marseille before also beating the Canadian 3-6 7-6 (6) 7-5 in Rotterdam earlier this year.\n\nHeading into their Madrid final, Rublev expects another tough day at the office against Auger-Aliassime.\n\n\"All our matches that we played was always drama, always three-sets matches.

It all started in the third round, when Auger-Aliassime up by a set and a break on Jakub Mensik when the Czech retired. Then in the quarterfinal and semifinal, Auger-Aliassime was given a walkover by Jannik Sinner and saw Jiri Lehecka retire just six games into their semifinal match.\n\nNot everyday you see a player reaching a final in such a way and that led to some comments about Auger-Aliassime's run that probably weren't the best to hear or read. But after falling just short in the Madrid final to Andrey Rublev, Auger-Aliassime revealed that he also wasn't at his best and he was actually close to giving a walkover to Mensik before their third-round match.\n\nAlso after the Madrid final, Auger-Aliassime shared that he heard \"a lot of players\" complaining about some kind of a virus that around.\n\n\"It was a weird week. Yeah, I was also struggling with my stomach mid-tournament. Wasn't even sure if one day I could play. And Mensik pulled out that day,\" Auger-Aliassime said after losing the Madrid final to Rublev.\n\nAfter winning the first set versus Rublev, Auger-Aliassime lost the next two sets in tight ways as the seventh-seeded Russian went on to claim a 4-6 7-5 7-5 win.\n\nUp by a set, Auger-Aliassime routinely held on to his second-set service games until the 12th game - when he got broken by Rublev and saw the final go into a decider.\n\nAfter losing his serve in the critical moments of the second set, Auger-Aliassime started to struggle on his serve as he was constantly facing pressure from Rublev. While Auger-Aliassime managed to save a total of five breaks points that he faced in the second, fourth and eighth games, he couldn't do the same in the 12th game when serving to stay in the match.\n\nLater, Auger-Aliassime revealed that he was battling cramps and he was just fighting to survive in the third set and at least try to give himself some chance of winning.\n\n\"From the start of the third set, as soon as it started, I started, yeah, feeling some cramps, both my legs. Then it was, like, just trying to hold serves and, I don't know, had many, many thoughts,\" Auger-Aliassime revealed.\n\nWhen reflecting on his Madrid final win, Rublev made a revelation that left the tennis community. During the entire tournament, Rublev apparently battled a myserious illness and he also had to anesthetize his foot after suffering from a swollen toe.\n\nAsked about Rublev's revelation, Auger-Aliassime gave credit to the Russian for fighting through and that's when the Canadian revealed that there were more players experiencing some kind of health issues in Madrid.\n\n\"It's, like, weird, I don't know. And then I think that, just dealing through - I mean, credit to him, as well, and like he said, the medical staff, in his speech, because I think a lot of players, there was kind of a virus maybe in Madrid, I heard, were dealing with things,\" Auger-Aliassime said.\n\n\"And I think all that, even though I was lucky that I didn't really play the quarters and semis, all that added up, came out today with the cramps, I think it was physically... I haven't cramped much in my career, so yeah, I think it was just the body being tired of, you know, fighting a virus during the week, yeah.\"\n\nAfter not having much success in 2023, Auger-Aliassime also didn't enjoy a great season before coming to Madrid. But at Caja Magica, 23-year-old Auger-Aliassime managed to reach his first Masters final but also find some game and momentum.\n\nAnd now even though he didn't win Madrid, Auger-Aliassime is leaving to the Rome Masters with his confidence increased.\n\n\"Even with the circumstances, there were some good moments where I showed a good leve. Obviously it was a weird week with all the walkovers, but I'm going to head into next week with the same confidence I came in this week actually, this tournament, I felt like I could play well,\" Auger-Aliassime said.\n\nWhen Rome starts this week, Auger-Aliassime - who improved to No. 20 in the rankings on Monday - will be making his sixth appearance at the tournament. In the past, Auger-Aliassime's best result at Foro Italico came in 2022 when he made the quarterfinal before losing to Novak Djokovic.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_M\u00e1gica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caja M\u00e1gica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148422.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

By Andy West\n\nAndrey Rublev and Felix Auger-Aliassime entered the Mutua Madrid Open each seeking a spark to reignite their 2024 seasons. Making it to the final in the Spanish capital has more than done the job.\n\nOn Sunday, the pair will clash in the title match at the ATP Masters 1000 event, where both could be considered surprise finalists, although perhaps for different reasons (Watch live from 12:30 p.m EDT/6:30 p.m. CEST).\n\nThe No. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Rublev arrived in Madrid off the back of four straight tour-level defeats. Yet he has roared back to his big-hitting best at the Caja Magica, where he has dropped just one set across five matches so far and is now one win away from his second Masters 1000 crown.\n\n\"It's normal to have up-and-downs,\" said Rublev on Friday, when he was asked if his sudden upturn in form had surprised him. \"The good thing when you have too many downs in one moment, is that you should go up. You cannot always lose in the first round... The next week you have more chances to win a couple of matches. In the end, I guess, this was the week.\"\n\nAside from his barren run prior to Madrid, Rublev has enjoyed a typically consistent season. He won 14 of his first 17 tour-level matches of the year and lifted a trophy in Hong Kong in January. Should he win in Sunday's final, Rublev will rise to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin as he chases a fifth consecutive appearance at the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.\n\nIn contrast, Auger-Aliassime arrived in Spain with a modest 11-10 record, but the Canadian nonetheless feels he has turned a corner after a 2023 season blighted by injury and a loss of form.\n\n\"Last year I had my tough moments on the tennis court, being injured,\" said the 23-year-old, who beat Casper Ruud in the fourth round in Madrid for his first Top 10 win of the year. \"Now, start of the year, I played some good matches, but I felt like I was practising better and better, playing well, and it was good. I got the best win of my season so far with Casper.\"\n\nAuger-Aliassime's progress through the draw this fortnight has been unique. In the third round and semi-finals, respectively, Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka were forced to retire while playing the Canadian due to injury. In between, he advanced by walkover through the quarter-finals after Jannik Sinner withdrew with a hip injury, but his path to the final will not impact his ambitions against Rublev.\n\n\"I still think I showed throughout the tournament, throughout the weeks, that I'm practising better, playing better and better,\" said Auger-Aliassime. \"There is this tournament and then obviously, as the season goes on, hopefully more good results come my way.\"\n\nBoth Rublev and Auger-Aliassime possess big serves and huge forehands. With the high altitude of Madrid contributing to conditions that are relatively fast for a clay-court event, they will each will hope to find their range with their two biggest weapons early in the title match.\n\nWhen it comes to experience in a Masters 1000 final, however, Rublev holds a clear advantage over the World No. 35 Auger-Aliassime. It will be a fifth championship match appearance at that level for the 26-year-old, who triumphed at the 2023 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, while it is a first for his opponent.\n\n\"Obviously it's a great opportunity,\" said Auger-Aliassime, who is chasing his 200th tour-level win on Sunday. \"It's a first final of a Masters for me, a new position to be in. These don't happen often, like every week. We play a lot of matches, we train a lot, but when you get a chance like this, obviously you're very motivated. I'm going to prepare for this match very seriously, but also not change my routine and try to prepare well for the match.\"\n\nPossessing one of the ATP Tour's most intense on-court personalities, Rublev has partly attributed his success in Madrid to his ability to keep his emotions in check in difficult situations. That was at its most clearest during his victory against Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"I think the key was I was completely calm the whole match,\" reflected Rublev after his three-set win against the defending champion. \"I did not say one word, even if I was losing.\"\n\nThe seventh-seeded Rublev can also look to his past record against Auger-Aliassime for a mental boost. He leads the Canadian 4-1 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series after saving three match points for victory in their most recent meeting earlier this season in Rotterdam. All but one of the pair's five previous meetings have gone to three sets.\n\n\"I guess when we play it's always tight matches, three-setters,\" said Auger-Aliassime. \"Let's see. Obviously, he's been at the top of our game for a few years. He deserves everything that is happening to him with how consistent he's been, how good he's been over the years.\n\n\"But Sunday is one match. Let's see what happens.

He has a 5-1 record against Auger-Aliassime, including a win in their sole matchup on clay.\n\nLehecka wept -- and smashed his racket on the ground -- when he called it quits due to an apparent back injury. Auger-Aliassime hugged him at the net to show his support for the 31st-ranked Czech, who knocked out Rafael Nadal on Wednesday.\n\nThis was the third time at the tournament that Auger-Aliassime moved on after his opponent had physical problems. His second-round opponent, Jakub Mensik, retired in their second set, and in the quarterfinals top-seeded Jannik Sinner said he couldn't play due to a hip injury and gave Auger-Aliassime a walkover. The 35th-ranked Canadian, who beat Casper Ruud in the round-of-16, will be seeking his sixth career title.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" Auger-Aliassime said. \"It's kind of a weird situation to be in on my part.

In addition to Sinner, Mensik, and Lehecka, Daniil Medvedev retired in the quarterfinals; Alcaraz was hampered by a sore right arm before he fell to Rublev; and Nadal did what he could before bowing out of what was likely his last appearance in his home country. Fritz, ranked 13th, entered the match with a 5-3 record against Rublev.\n\nAfter an evenly contested start, Rublev pounced by breaking Fritz from love on his last service game of the first set. He remained in control. Fritz hit seven aces -- to Rublev's five -- but landed only 55% of his first serves. Rublev landed 75% of his first serves and struck 20 winners to Fritz's 16.\n\n\"I could have played a lot better today,\" Fritz said. \"A lot of credit to Andrey.

Within 73 minutes in Manolo Santana Stadium, Rublev's rich mix of serve and forehand proved too much for Fritz as he completed an astonishing triumph.\n\n\"Mentally I was feeling much better and I was able to perform. Putting emotions in the right direction. For sure it has helped me to reach the final. Without this, I would not be in the final,\" Rublev said as quoted by ATP.\n\nRublev had lost four straight tour-level matches prior to arriving in Madrid, but the victory extended his incredible comeback to form. In Sunday's final, he will compete against either Felix Auger-Aliassime or Jiri Lehecka in an attempt to win his second ATP Tour title of the year.\n\n\"I started really tight. I missed a couple of returns, a couple of easy shots, but it is part of sport and part of tennis. When he broke me, I thought, 'OK, it is only the beginning, we have a long set and we will see. Maybe he will also not start well on his serve,'\" Rublev said.\n\n\"In the end, I think in the first three points he didn't hit a first serve, so I was able to win and it was 0/30. On one break point I played well, and somehow it was 1-1. Then the match was equal until the end of the set,\" the seventh seed added.\n\nRublev's semifinal victory turned out very differently than it had started. In the first game, Fritz broke the eighth-ranked player in the PIF ATP Rankings, converting his first break point to set up a flawless start to his second clay-court Masters 1000 semifinal. But before the American could capitalize, Rublev quickly recovered the break by focusing on his opponent's second serves.\n\nRublev was under pressure on service in the first game of the second set, but he sealed the first set by breaking to love in the tenth game. But this time, he held for 1-0 by saving both break points he faced. In the sixth game, he then decisively broke Fritz to complete his victory.

One week can change everything, you have to remember that... because you can't perform always at 100 per cent, so it is normal there will be ups and downs.\"\n\nRublev is seeking his 16th career title, his first Masters 1000 title since Monte-Carlo last year, and his second of the season after winning Hong Kong in January.\n\nAuger-Aliassime was handed an easy passage through to the final after an emotional Jiri Lehecka was forced\n\nto retire in the first set of their semi-final.\n\nIt was the third match of the fortnight that Auger-Aliassime has not had to complete, with Jakub Mensik also retiring and top seed Jannik Sinner withdrawing through injury ahead of their scheduled quarter-final.\n\nThe 35th-ranked Canadian, who beat Casper Ruud this week, will be seeking his sixth career title and first since winning in Basel in October.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" said Canadian Auger-Aliassime, who had been having a difficult season. \"I don't know if it's ever happened to a player before.\n\n\"It's kind of a weird situation to be in on my part. It's never happened to me in my career so far, a withdrawal or a walkover or retirement of this sort, and back-to-back like this. I couldn't believe what was happening when I saw his back blocked on him.\n\n\"I feel really bad for him. I've had injuries myself, and we can all imagine how it feels to come out on a night like this, hoping to win to go through, having a battle with your opponent, and not being able to play.\n\n\"I have a lot of empathy for Jiri, and I can't do anything but try to prepare for Sunday.\"\n\nThe men's singles in Madrid has been hard hit by injuries and fitness concerns.\n\nWorld No 1 Novak Djokovic withdrew before the tournament and in addition to Sinner and Lehecka, Daniil Medvedev retired from his quarter-final while Alcaraz was hampered by a sore right arm before he fell to Rublev.\n\nMeanwhile, Rafael Nadal did what he could before bowing out of what was likely his last appearance in his home country.\n\nIn the run-up to the second Grand Slam of 2024 - the French Open at Roland Garros from May 26 - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the clay-court season.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Rublev overcame a gritty Auger-Aliassime and his own emotion to become the first Russian man since Hall of Famer Marat Safin in 2004 -- when it was still a hard-court event -- to win Madrid.\n\nThe seventh-seeded Rublev double faulted twice in succession to start the match, gifted two breaks almost immediately, was a point away from going down 1-5, yet never completely let his sometime raging temper consume him.\n\nInstead, Rublev channeled frustration into action closing a two hour, 48-minute battle when Auger-Aliassime coughed up his fourth double fault.\n\n\"For sure, the best mental performance [of my career] when I won the title,\" Rublev told Tennis Channel's Prakash Amritraj afterward.\n\nA match that started and ended with doubles had a whole lot of dynamic shotmaking for the duration.\n\nAfterward, Rublev, who knocked off four seeds -- -Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Tallon Griekspoor, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz -- en route to the final, paid tribute to Auger-Aliassime as a class character.\n\n\"I would like to say thanks a lot to Felix,\" Rublev said. \"Very disappointed to lose a match like this. I'm sorry I know the feeling.\n\n\"I say this many times and I will not be tired to say it again: You are a true inspiration for me as a player, for the spectators, for the kids, how professional you are, how humble you are, how nice person you are. I just want to wish you all the best. You always have great people around you...hope you will have together many more success.\"\n\nWorld No. 35 Auger-Aliassime, who took a couple of medical timeouts for apparent muscle spasms in his legs, was denied his 200th career victory. Still, Auger-Aliassime will rise to No. 20 with this inspired run to his maiden Masters 1000 final.\n\n\"Congrats to Andrey, [you're a] very deserving winner congrats to you and your team,\" Auger-Aliassime said afterward. \"I tried until the end. I'm sorry I made you maybe think, overthink, I was struggling. You're a great player, we always have a great time on the tour, very deserving. Well done.\"\n\nThough 2023 Monte-Carlo champion Rublev has been criticized for failing to surpass a Grand Slam quarterfinal in 22 major appearances, consider what he has achieved. In addition to six Slam quarterfinals in his last seven appearances, Rublev now owns two Masters 1000 titles.\n\nThe 26-year-old Russian is just the fifth active man with multiple clay-court Masters 1000 titles at different events joining Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Alexander Zverev and Andy Murray in that class.

Felix Auger-Aliassime vs. Andrey Rublev - prediction, head-to-head, tournament so far", "body": "Felix Auger-Aliassime and Andrey Rublev will lock horns for the sixth time in their respective careers on Sunday, with the 2024 Madrid Open trophy up for grabs in the Spanish capital.\n\nAliassime reached the final after Jiri Lehecka was forced to retire from their semi-final due to a back problem, while Rublev navigated his way past Taylor Fritz in the final four.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nAuger-Aliassime's progression to the Madrid Open final has been interesting, as he has been involved in two retirements and a walkover, with the 23-year-old benefitting from injury issues for his opponents.\n\nThe world number 35 did see his first and second-round contests go the distance, overcoming Yoshihito Nishioka and Adrian Mannarino respectively to progress to round three.\n\nJakub Mensik was forced to retire early in the second set, though, due to injury, before Auger-Aliassime put in an excellent performance in the round of 16, beating Casper Ruud 6-4 7-5.\n\nSince the last-16 contest, Auger-Aliassime has played just six games, as he was given a walkover in the quarter-finals due to a troublesome hip problem for Jannik Sinner, before Lehecka was unable to shake off a back problem when the two were level at 3-3 in their semi-final.\n\nThe Canadian, who has won five singles titles on the ATP tour, will enter this match as the underdog, having struggled against Rublev in the past, but he produced a standout performance against Ruud in the round of 16 and will certainly be confident of causing his opponent issues on Sunday.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nRublev, meanwhile, has had to complete all five of his matches at the tournament to progress to the final, with his journey starting in the second round, having received a bye in the first round.\n\nFacundo Bagnis and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina were beaten in the second round and third round respectively, before the Russian overcame Tallon Griekspoor in the round of 16 courtesy of a 6-2 6-3 success.\n\nThe world number eight then produced an excellent performance against Carlos Alcaraz, recording a 4-6 6-3 6-2 victory to progress to the semi-finals, where he beat Fritz 6-4 6-3.\n\nRublev, who has won 15 ATP Tour singles titles, has reached the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open but is yet to progress further than the final eight in a Grand Slam.\n\nThe Russian's serve and forehand have been particularly impressive in Madrid, and there will be pressure on him to triumph this weekend against his Canadian opponent.\n\nTournament so far\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime:\n\nFirst round: vs. Yoshihito Nishioka 4-6 6-1 6-4\n\nSecond round: vs. Adrian Mannarino 6-0 6-4\n\nThird round: vs. Jakub Mensik 6-1 1-0r\n\nRound of 16: vs. Casper Ruud 6-4 7-5\n\nQuarter-final: vs. Jannik Sinner (walkover)\n\nSemi-final: vs. Jiri Lehecka 3-3r\n\nAndrey Rublev:\n\nSecond round: vs. Facundo Bagnis 6-1 6-4\n\nThird round: vs. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7[12]-6[10] 6-4\n\nRound of 16: vs. Tallon Griekspoor 6-2 6-4\n\nQuarter-final: vs. Carlos Alcaraz 4-6 6-3 6-2\n\nSemi-final: vs. Taylor Fritz 6-4 6-3\n\nHead To Head\n\nUmag (2018) - Round of 16: Rublev wins 6-4 6[4]-7 6-3\n\nAdelaide (2020) - Semi-final: Rublev wins 7-6[5] 6-7[7] 6-4\n\nRotterdam (2022) - Semi-final: Auger-Aliassime wins 6[5]-7 6-4 6-2\n\nMarseille (2022) - Final: Rublev wins 7-5 7-6[4]\n\nRotterdam (2024) - Round of 16: Rublev wins 3-6 7-6[6] 7-5\n\nRublev has certainly enjoyed the better of the previous meetings between the two, boasting a 4-1 lead in the overall head-to-head record.\n\nAuger-Aliassime's only success over Rublev came in Rotterdam in 2022, but he has lost his last two match-ups with Sunday's opponent, including when they locked horns in Rotterdam again earlier this year.\n\nIndeed, Rublev triumphed in the last-16 stage of the competition, but all five of their previous meetings have been competitive affairs, with four of them going to three sets.\n\nRublev's most famous win over Auger-Aliassime came in 2022 in Marseille, when he recorded a 7-5 7-6[4] victory to win the 2022 Open 13 Provence.\n\nWe say: Rublev to win in three sets\n\nRublev is the favourite for Sunday's final, but he has played a lot more tennis in the tournament than Auger-Aliassime, and it remains to be seen whether that has an impact in this encounter.\n\nAuger-Aliassime should be good enough to claim a set on Sunday, but we are expecting Rublev to have too much for his opponent, backing the world number eight to secure the trophy in three sets.\n\nID:542918:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7595:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports

They were doing some tricky things and I was able to at least be able to play.\"\n\nRublev, who defeated second seed Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals before he battled past Taylor Fritz to reach the final, had the worst possible start when he was broken to love in the first game of the match with two double faults and the Russian quickly found himself 4-1 down as Auger-Aliassime fired several winners.\n\nThe seventh seed fought back and managed to break Auger-Aliassime but the Canadian was well in control by then, serving well to make optimal use of his strong forehand before sealing the opening set on serve with a resounding winner at the net.\n\nBut Rublev, who had eliminated second seed and home favourite Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, was far more aggressive with his shot-making in the second set which went with serve.\n\nThe Russian also found his range on his first serve and constantly put Auger-Aliassime on the backfoot before clinching the decisive break when he was up 6-5 to force a decider.\n\nIt was a case of deja vu in the final set too which went with serve until Rublev broke again at 6-5.\n\nAuger-Aliassime was under pressure as he served to stay in the contest but he made two double faults, the second handing the title to Rublev in an anti-climactic end to the final.\n\n\"I would say this is the most proud title of my career,\" Rublev said. \"I was almost dead every day. I was not sleeping at night. The last three, four days I didn't sleep.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the second Grand Slam of 2024 - the French Open at Roland Garros from May 26 - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the clay-court season.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

The Canadian had luck on his side in his run to the final of the prestigious claycourt tournament in the Spanish capital. After defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Adrian Mannarino, Jakub Mensik, and Casper Ruud, he set up a clash against top seed Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals.\n\nHowever, Sinner withdrew from the tournament ahead of his match against the Canadian, citing a hip injury. As a result, Auger-Aliassime made his way to the semifinals, where he faced Jiri Lehecka, who retired mid-match with a back injury, allowing Auger-Aliassime to breeze into the final.\n\nAuger-Aliassime started the final on the front foot to win the first set 6-4 against Rublev. However, the resilient Russian roared back into the contest in the second set, winning it 7-5, and forcing a decider. Rublev went on to clinch the deciding set by the same margin to deny the Canadian what would have been his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title.\n\n\"It was a weird week with all the walkovers\" - Felix Auger-Aliassime\n\nDuring a press conference after his Madrid Open final loss, Felix Auger-Aliassime reflected on his run to the last hurdle in the Spanish capital. The Canadian said the second week of the tournament was \"weird\" for him amid Sinner's withdrawal and Lehecka's mid-match retirement.\n\n\"Obviously, it was a weird week with all the walkovers, but I'm going to head into next week with the same confidence I came in this week actually, this tournament, I felt like I could play well,\" Auger-Aliassime told the press (via ATP Tour).\n\nHowever, despite the defeat, the 23-year-old expressed optimism for the Italian Open, which is the last big claycourt event before the 2024 French Open.\n\n\"I feel like it's a tournament where I have had good memories, as well, in the past. I'm going to try to just keep going, keep doing the things I'm doing well, not put too much pressure, expectations that I need to be perfect, and enjoy. Enjoy the days and learn from the downs, stay cool and take it easy,\" Felix Auger-Aliassime added.\n\nThe Canadian's best finish at the Italian Open came in 2022 when he reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Novak Djokovic.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sudipto_pati@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sudipto Pati", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihito_Nishioka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshihito Nishioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mannarino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Mannarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/6c566-17149617668375-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 295, "textEnd": 300}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He steadied the ship with a solid win against Facundo Bagnis in the second round and then outfoxed the likes of Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Tallon Griekspoor en route to the quarterfinals.\n\nThe seventh seed then faced a tough task against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the last eight.

At one point, Auger-Aliassime was on a five-match losing streak between May and August but he did make his 2023 season look a bit better even winning Basel in late October.\n\nWhile Auger-Aliassime didn't make a great start to this season either, he started to rediscover his game and form at the ongoing Madrid Masters, where he has made the final.\n\n\"I have carried out a very interesting process since I turned professional because I felt that every year I was progressing, I was a better player. Then 2023 arrived, which was a terrible year in my career and in my life, and we forgot everything that I did before. I think that, in sport, everything changes quickly and we tend to forget,\" Auger-Aliassime said, via Punto de Break.\n\nWhen Auger-Aliassime takes on Andrey Rublev in the Madrid final on Sunday, he will be aiming for his first Masters title and the biggest title of his career. And all of this is happening for Auger-Aliassime after the most challenging and difficult period of his career.\n\nAuger-Aliassime, now ranked at No 35 in the world, is also guaranteed to return to the top-20 on Monday.\n\n\"What I am most proud of is that I have maintained my passion for tennis during difficult times, I have known how to deal with frustration and continue wanting with all my might to be a great tennis player. It is great to see myself in this situation; life and tennis smile at me again,\" Auger-Aliassime said.\n\n\"Some of the best matches of my career have been on this surface and I have always felt that I have the potential to do well on clay.\"\n\nIn Madrid, Auger-Aliassime came back from a set down to beat Yoshihito Nishioka in his opener before sealing a two-set win against Adriano Mannarino in his next match. In the third round, Auger-Aliassime was up by a set on Jakub Mensik and also up by an early break in the second set when the Czech tennis player retired from the match due to injury.\n\nThen, Auger-Aliassime defeated three-time Grand Slam finalist Casper Ruud in the round-of-16 before top-seeded Jannik Sinner gave him a walkover in the quarterfinal due to a hip injury. On Friday, Auger-Aliassime was tied to three games apiece with Jiri Lehecka in the semifinal when the Czech was forced to quit the match due to a back injury.\n\n\"Obviously I feel bad for those who have had to retire playing against me. I have never experienced anything similar. I have had several injuries and I know what it feels like when they deprive you of doing what you love most in the world. I know that I am facing a great opportunity in my career. I think I had been training well for weeks, having good feelings and against Ruud I got a victory that gave me a lot of confidence,\" Auger-Aliassime said.\n\nOn Sunday, Auger-Aliassime will be taking on Rublev for the sixth time in his career and searching just for just his second win over the Russian tennis star. While Auger-Aliassime has just one win over Rublev, three of his four losses came in three sets while one came in two very tight sets.\n\nWith that being said, Auger-Aliassime will enter the Madrid final confident that he can play well and beat Rublev despite having just one win in their previous five meetings.\n\n\"Every time we have played they have been close matches, with very crazy situations. I want to concentrate on playing my best tennis because this will give me the opportunity to beat a great player, who deserves everything good that happens to him due to the enormous consistency that has been going on for years. proving, remaining in the elite,\" Auger-Aliassime said of facing Rublev.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Auger-Aliassime can beat Rublev for his first title of the year and also his first Masters title.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihito_Nishioka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshihito Nishioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walkover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148375.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Rublev had been on a four-match losing streak heading into Madrid, securing just a single win in his last six matches. Auger-Aliassime had been saddled with a modest 11-10 record for his 2024 campaign and had won multiple matches in only one of his previous seven tournaments.\n\nSurprising for both guys this fortnight has resulted in Rublev's fifth Masters 1000 final and Auger-Aliassime's first. Rublev triumphed at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters and was a point away from doing the same last fall in Shanghai.\n\nIt's safe to say that Auger-Aliassime has gotten a lot of help en route to his first title match at this level. In fact, the 23-year-old Canadian has completed only three matches in Madrid. In addition to wins over Yoshihito Nishioka, Adrian Mannarino, and Casper Ruud, he got a walkover from Jannik Sinner and retirements from Jakub Mensik and Jiri Lehecka.\n\nRublev has been tested against healthy opponents from start to finish, but he was largely untroubled on the way to Sunday's final. The world No. 8 dropped a set to Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals to go along with straight-set victories at the expense of Facundo Bagnis, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Tallon Griekspoor, and Taylor Fritz.", "source": {"uri": "10sballs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "10sBalls.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricky_dimon@10sballs.com", "name": "Ricky Dimon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umag", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umag"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Umag"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Lehe\u010dka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Lehe\u010dka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Davidovich_Fokina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Davidovich Fokina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihito_Nishioka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshihito Nishioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallon_Griekspoor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tallon Griekspoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facundo_Bagnis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facundo Bagnis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Mannarino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Mannarino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Arm_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Arm Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.10sballs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/RublevSlideEPA.jpg?fit=920%2C618&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Both have played some excellent tennis to reach the title match and both will no doubt be desperate to get their hands on the trophy. But will it be Andrey Rublev or Felix Auger-Aliassime who comes out on top?\n\nRublev arrived at the ATP Madrid Open after a disappointing start to the clay-court season that he had seen him lose early in Monte Carlo, where he was defending champion, and in Barcelona. But he has looked rejuvenated in Madrid. He opened his campaign with a 6-1 6-4 win over Facundo Bagnis which he backed up by getting the Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in a tight two-set battle to reach the fourth round. There he beat Tallon Griekspoor 6-2 6-4.\n\nIn the quarterfinals he recorded his best win in recent memory, beating second seed and home hope Carlos Alcaraz in a three-set thriller, 4-6 6-3 6-2. Rublev then dispatched 12 seed Taylor Fritz in short order, 6-4 6-3, to reach the final at the ATP Madrid Open. He will surely feel confident when he steps out on court to take on Auger-Aliassime.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Canadian has played some fine tennis himself this last week, not least in beating fifth seed Casper Ruud in the round of 16. But he has also benefitted from walkovers or retirements against Jakub Mensik in the second round, top seed Jannik Sinner in the quarterfinals and Jir Lehecka in the last four. He has also lost four of his five meetings with Rublev - his sole win coming on an indoor hard court in Rotterdam two years ago.\n\nThe conditions in Madrid are rather different, and Rublev has also since avenged that lone defeat by beating Auger-Aliassime in Rotterdam earlier this year. His consistent power and accuracy proved to be the difference that day and should ensure he emerges victorious once again. At his very best, Auger-Aliassime could win this match, but he has not shown that yet in Madrid, and Rublev is playing well enough to punish the Canadian's weaknesses.", "source": {"uri": "lastwordonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Last Word on Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caja_M\u00e1gica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caja M\u00e1gica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Davidovich_Fokina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Davidovich Fokina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallon_Griekspoor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tallon Griekspoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facundo_Bagnis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facundo Bagnis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://lastwordonsports.com/tennis/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2023/04/Rublev.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

In a battle for a place in the final, Felix faced the first-time Masters 1000 semi-finalist Jiri Lehecka and moved over the top after six and a half games.\n\nThe young Czech retired due to a lower back injury, ending his campaign in tears and sending the Canadian through. Auger-Aliassime needed six triumphs to advance into the final. He defeated three rivals and received a walkover from Jannik Sinner and two retirements, setting the title clash versus Andrey Rublev.\n\nFelix produced three fine holds and wasted a break chance in game three.

Struggling with his movement, the Czech sprayed a backhand error in the third game and offered the Canadian a break chance.\n\nHe denied it with a powerful serve and held after Felix's loose backhand to open a 2-1 gap.

In the fourth round, Lehecka met the king of clay Rafael Nadal and scored a 7-5, 6-4 victory in two hours and one minute.\n\nThe Czech played well, facing only one break point and stealing the Spaniard's serve at the end of the opener and beginning of the second set.

The Russian had lost four straight matches that had seen him exit several prestigious tournaments on the ATP Tour earlier than he would have liked.\n\nAt the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Rublev lost in the third round to Jiri Lehecka. Tomas Machac ousted him from the Miami Open in the second round. Next, at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was the defending champion, Rublev suffered another second-round loss at the hands of Alexei Popyrin. Yet another second-round defeat against Brandon Nakashima saw him exit the Barcelona Open.\n\nThe back-to-back early exits also impacted Rublev's ATP Tour ranking, as he dropped to World No. 8. However, in Madrid, the Russian looked back to his best, despite playing with fever and illness. The 26-year-old reached the final after battling past Facundo Bagnis, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Tallon Griekspoor, Carlos Alcaraz, and Taylor Fritz.\n\nIn the final, he looked down and out as opponent Felix Auger-Aliassime won the first set 6-4. However, Rublev displayed miraculous powers of recovery to win the next two sets 7-5, 7-5, to win his first-ever Madrid Open title. The win also marked his second ATP Masters 1000 title.\n\nSpeaking with Sky Sports after tasting glory in the Spanish capital, Rublev opened up on the health issues that plagued him during the \"fairytale week\". The Russian revealed that apart from his fever, he also had to deal with an inflammation in his feet.\n\n\"Doctors were doing some injections (for the fever) that were.. at least I was able to go on court and then I got inflammation in my finger, on my feet, and I could not put my feet inside my shoes. So, there were doing also, anesthesia, so it was a fairytale week,\" Rublev told Sky Sports.\n\nThe 26-year-old also proceeded to express his pride following his Madrid Open triumph.\n\n\"I think I feel I'm so negative about myself always but it's the first time I feel so proud of myself,\" Rublev added.\n\nMadrid Open triumph marks Andrey Rublev's second title this season\n\nRublev won the Hong Kong Open in January 2024, a tournament that took place in the build-up to the Australian Open. In Hong Kong, the Russian got the better of Liam Broady, Arthur Fils, and Shang Juncheng before making short work of Emil Ruusuvuori in the final.\n\nThe Madrid Open title, Rublev's second this season, takes his career title tally to 16. Next up for the Russian is the Italian Open in Rome, before he sets his sights on the 2024 French Open.\n\nRublev will be hoping to recover from his health issues before starting his Italian Open campaign. With Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner having withdrawn from the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome, the Russian is among the favorites to triumph in the Italian capital.", "source": {"uri":

However, Rublev, despite grappling with a fever throughout the tournament, mounted a fierce comeback to secure victory in just under three hours.\n\nThe 26-year-old Russian, who had entered the Madrid Open in a slump, having lost his previous four matches on the tour, showcased his resilience by dropping only two sets on his path to claiming the title.\n\nRublev's triumph marks a remarkable turnaround in form, highlighting his determination and tenacity on the court.\n\n\"No words, if you knew what I've been through in the last nine days, you wouldn't imagine that I would be able to win a title... Last six weeks I was losing in the first rounds,\" Rublev said.\n\n\"I was (close to pulling out) because there were a few issues I couldn't fix, but I have to give full credit to the doctors. They were magical and did some tricky things... Somehow I was able to play. I've never seen this in my life.\n\n\"I would say this is the most proud title of my career. I didn't sleep well the last three-four days.\"\n\nAuger-Aliassime's path to the final of the Madrid Open may have been aided by walkovers from three of his opponents, including top seed Jannik Sinner. However, any doubts about his merit were dispelled in the opening set of the final, where he displayed clinical prowess by dismantling Andrey Rublev's serve.\n\nRublev's shaky start, marked by two double faults and an early break, allowed Auger-Aliassime to swiftly establish a commanding 4-1 lead with an array of winners.\n\nDespite Rublev's efforts to stage a comeback and secure a break, Auger-Aliassime maintained control, utilizing his strong serve and forehand to clinch the set convincingly.\n\nIn the second set, Rublev showcased a more aggressive approach, matching Auger-Aliassime shot for shot. With his first serve finding its mark and relentless pressure on his opponent, Rublev managed to secure the crucial break to force a decider.\n\nThe final set mirrored the previous two, with both players holding serve until Rublev capitalized on a critical moment, breaking Auger-Aliassime at 6-5.\n\nDespite Auger-Aliassime's efforts to stay in the contest, two untimely double faults ultimately handed the title to Rublev in an anti-climactic conclusion to the final.\n\n\"Congrats to Andrey, very deserving winner. Congrats to you and your team. I tried till the end,\" Auger-Aliassime said.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

It was a pulsating title clash against the big-hitting Canadian that saw the 26-year-old Russian prevail in the end.\n\nIt was his second Masters 1000 title after his triumph at the Monte-Carlo Masters in 2023. Rublev's performance saw him climb two spots up to sixth in the ATP rankings.\n\nIt was not an easy title triumph for Andrey Rublev\n\nAndrey Rublev had to endure a few tough matches en route to his triumph in Madrid, most notably against Carlos Alcaraz and against Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final.\n\nAgainst Alcaraz, the Russian was set down but managed to bounce back to win the match. Rublev's forehand is one of the most powerful ones in the business and his ability to play the angles well with it makes him a formidable proposition on clay. His cross-court forehand is one of his most effective shots. He managed to pummel Alcaraz repeatedly with his strong forehand.\n\nMoreover, he also handled Auger-Aliassime's lethal serve reasonably well by returning deep. He also used his inside-out forehand repeatedly to pound the Canadian's backhand, as the latter played the shot long repeatedly.\n\nRublev also prevailed against Taylor Fritz of the United States in the semifinal, thereby handling another big server quite commendably. His return of serve has improved in the recent past, thereby making him a well-rounded player.\n\nThe Russian endured a difficult phase prior to the tournament\n\nRublev got defaulted at the Dubai Open last February for using obscene language at a line judge in his mother-tongue. Then, he lost four consecutive matches starting in the second round of the Indian Wells Open against Jiri Lehecka of Czech Republic.\n\nHe also failed to defend his crown at Monte-Carlo in the process. All of that caused his rank to drop. Hence, he was not touted to do well in Madrid by most people.

But the 23-year-old also showed form reminiscent of his time in the world's Top 10, defeating red-hot Barcelona champion Casper Ruud in straight sets.\n\nIn the final against Rublev, Auger-Aliassime battled well and saved eight of the 11 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. His 14 aces helped keep the match tight until the end of the third set. But ultimately, Rublev prevailed in two hours and 49 minutes.\n\n\"It's a long match, three sets, many games.

But yeah, wasn't meant to be.\"\n\nAuger-Aliassime, who said he struggled in the middle of the tournament with his stomach, suffered from cramp in the deciding set. Felix saved five of the six break points he faced in the third set, but was never able to put an abundance of pressure on his opponent, which proved his downfall.\n\n\"From the start of the third set, as soon as it started, I started feeling some cramps, both my legs. Then it was just trying to hold serve and, I don't know, I had many, many thoughts.

Within 73 minutes in Manolo Santana Stadium, Rublev's rich mix of serve and forehand proved too much for Fritz as he completed an astonishing triumph.\n\nAlso Read | MI vs KKR IPL 2024 Stat Highlights: Resilient Kolkata Knight Riders Re-Writes Records After Victory Against Mumbai Indians at Wankhede Stadium After Twelve Years.\n\n\"Mentally I was feeling much better and I was able to perform. Putting emotions in the right direction. For sure it has helped me to reach the final. Without this, I would not be in the final,\" Rublev said as quoted by ATP.\n\nRublev had lost four straight tour-level matches prior to arriving in Madrid, but the victory extended his incredible comeback to form. In Sunday's final, he will compete against either Felix Auger-Aliassime or Jiri Lehecka in an attempt to win his second ATP Tour title of the year.\n\nAlso Read | IPL 2024 Points Table Updated With Net Run Rate: Kolkata Knight Riders Consolidate at Second Position With 24-Run Victory Over Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals Remain On Top.\n\n\"I started really tight. I missed a couple of returns, a couple of easy shots, but it is part of sport and part of tennis. When he broke me, I thought, 'OK, it is only the beginning, we have a long set and we will see. Maybe he will also not start well on his serve,'\" Rublev said.\n\n\"In the end, I think in the first three points he didn't hit a first serve, so I was able to win and it was 0/30. On one break point I played well, and somehow it was 1-1. Then the match was equal until the end of the set,\" the seventh seed added.\n\nRublev's semifinal victory turned out very differently than it had started. In the first game, Fritz broke the eighth-ranked player in the PIF ATP Rankings, converting his first break point to set up a flawless start to his second clay-court Masters 1000 semifinal. But before the American could capitalize, Rublev quickly recovered the break by focusing on his opponent's second serves.\n\nRublev was under pressure on service in the first game of the second set, but he sealed the first set by breaking to love in the tenth game. But this time, he held for 1-0 by saving both break points he faced. In the sixth game, he then decisively broke Fritz to complete his victory.

Can it make him someone who can truly push to win Grand Slams? We don't know.\n\nBut, whatever he has been doing off-court - be it meditation, or something similar - has been working.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samadhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Auger-Aliassime", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Tennis_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai Tennis Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Fritz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Fritz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meditation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2024/05/06175941/Andrey-Rublev-Samadhi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The holiday is celebrated differently by Orthodox and non-Orthodox Christians based on differing calendars. Orthodox Christians follow the Julian calendar, which is based on the solar cycle, and observe Easter later than non-orthodox Christians.\n\nThis year, the Orthodox Easter Sunday fell on May 5, the exact same day that Andrey Rublev, an orthodox Christian himself, won the 2024 Madrid Open. Rublev came back a set down to defeat Felix Auger-Aliassime 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 to win his second Masters-1000 tournament.\n\nThe Russian was on a poor run before Madrid, losing four consecutive matches in straight sets. However, he turned around his form in the most spectacular fashion by defeating Facundo Bagnis, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Tallon Griekspoor, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, and Auger-Aliassime en route to his second title in 2024.\n\nRublev's victory in Madrid is his third ATP Tour-level triumph that coincided with Orthodox Easter Sunday in three successive years. In 2023, the festival was celebrated on April 16, the day on which Rublev emerged as champion at the Monte-Carlo Masters. The 26-year-old bettered the likes of Karen Khachanov, Taylor Fritz, and Holger Rune to win his maiden title at the Masters 1000 level.\n\nIn 2022, Andrey Rublev lifted his 11th tour-level title at the Serbia Open. The title contest in Belgrade took place on April 24, 2022, the day of Orthodox Easter Sunday. Even more interestingly, the Russian defeated home hero Novak Djokovic, in the final of the ATP 250 tournament.\n\nRublev was the No. 2 seed at the 2022 Serbia Open and defeated Jiri Lehecka, Taro Daniel, and Fabio Fognini before downing Djokovic in the final.\n\nAndrey Rublev is the first man to win singles and doubles titles at Madrid Open\n\nAndrey Rublev has become the first man to win both singles and doubles titles at the Madrid Open after his win in the former category this year. The Russian won the doubles title in the Spanish capital last year, along with compatriot Karen Khachanov.\n\nThe unseeded pair defeated Alex de Minaur-Grigor Dimitrov, No. 5 seeds mate Pavic-Nikola Mektic, Jamie Murray-Michael Venus, No. 4 seeds Jean-Julien Rojer- Marcelo Arevalo, and No. 7 seeds Rohan Bopanna-Matthew Ebden to win first Masters-1000 title as a pair in 2023.\n\nDominic Thiem was the only player who got the closest to winning the Madrid Open in singles and doubles. The former US Open champion reached the singles final at La Caja Magica in 2017 and 2018 but lost the title to Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev, respectively.\n\nIn 2019, he again reached the final in Madrid, but this time in the doubles. He linked up with Argentine star Diego Schwartzman, and they navigated their way to a maiden Masters 1000 doubles final before losing to Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau.", "source": {"uri":

By ATP Staff\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime's run to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 final at the Mutua Madrid Open has propelled the Canadian back into the Top 20 of the PIF ATP Rankings, while Andrey Rublev has also moved upwards after lifting the trophy on the clay of the Spanish capital.\n\nATPTour.com looks at the movers in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday, 6 May.\n\nNo. 20 Felix Auger-Aliassime, +15\n\nThe 23-year-old Auger-Aliassime enjoyed a run to the biggest final of his career in Madrid, where he dropped just one set en route to the championship match. He earned his first Top 10 win of the season in the fourth round by defeating the in-form Casper Ruud and, despite losing out to Rublev in the title match, the Canadian returns to the Top 20 of the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since last October.\n\nNo. 6 Andrey Rublev, +2\n\nRublev arrived in Madrid on a four-match losing streak and battled illness for much of the second half of the tournament in the Spanish capital. Yet those factors did not stop him surging to his second Masters 1000 crown and he has risen two spots to World No. 6 as a result. Rublev downed defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals, before rallying past Auger-Aliassime in a tense final for the 16th ATP Tour trophy of his career.\n\nNo. 23 Jiri Lehecka, +8 (Joint Career High)\n\nJiri Lehecka has returned to his career high of No. 23 by jumping eight spots thanks to a semi-final run in Madrid. The Czech reeled off three straight-sets victories, most notably ending record five-time champion Rafael Nadal's Madrid career in the fourth round, en route to his first Masters 1000 semi-final. Lehecka was ultimately forced to retire from his last-four clash against Auger-Aliassime due to a lower back injury.\n\nNo. 31 Mariano Navone, +10 (Career High)\n\nMariano Navone clinched the biggest title of his career with victory at the ATP Challenger Tour 175 event in Cagliari. The Argentine beat home favourite Lorenzo Musetti in the championship match to continue his rapid rise up the PIF ATP Rankings. Outside the Top 100 as recently as February, Navone is now at a career-high No. 31.\n\nNo. 32 Alejandro Tabilo, +6 (Career High)\n\nChilean Alejandro Tabilo was the other champion across a Challenger 175 clay-court doubleheader in Europe. Having also lifted a tour-level title in January in Auckland, his triumph last week in Aix-en-Provence made him the first player to a title on both the ATP Tour and ATP Challenger Tour this season.

Tomorrow we got to the hospital to check,\" Rublev told Sky Sports Tennis\n\n\"Half of my throat is blocked completely. And the first days I couldn't eat because it was burning so I had to eat baby food. It was a disaster.\n\n\"Then when I start to feel a bit better, my throat became even more inflamed. Nothing helped, so doctors were doing some injections that allowed me to go on court.\n\n\"Then I started to get inflammation on my feet that started to affect the bones. I couldn't put my feet inside the shoes.\n\n\"So this is a fairy tale week. I am so negative about myself always, but I feel so proud now.\n\n\"There are no thoughts. The last couple of nights, I'm waking up in pain, but it doesn't matter now. I can sit for the week in the hospital.\"\n\n\"In the end, I think it helped me,\" he added. \"I start to focus on everything because I need to save energy. I start to focus on the game. I couldn't even say 'come on' because I had no voice.\n\n\"The first matches, since the beginning of the tournament, I have felt like I played well, but then the virus came.

The seventh seed flipped the script in style in the Spanish capital, where he bounced back from a difficult few months by lifting his second ATP Masters 1000 trophy on Sunday.\n\nReflecting on his recent form, Rublev believes highs and lows are part of the sport but is delighted to be back in the winners' circle in Madrid.\n\n\"I think it's normal to have ups and downs because this season I started really well and I was playing amazing,\" Rublev said in his post-match press conference. \"Then somehow I started to do a bit worse and then a couple of weeks I could not win a match. I think this is normal to have up-and-downs and everyone go through this, so I guess my focus was not to feel if when I will go back to normal or what is normal.\n\n\"For me, it was just to keep working, to keep trying to improve, because in one moment the season is long and we have too many opportunities. In one moment I will have a chance and then as soon as I will have a chance, I will need to use it, because this week will change everything. In the end, it happened here. Now looks like clay season has been so good to me, even if the past two clay tournaments I lost first round.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old's victory is even more impressive when he revealed that he has battled with illness all week.\n\n\"I'm still sick and tomorrow I will go to the hospital for a full check,\" Rublev said. \"I don't know exactly what's going on, because I have been sick already for eight, nine days and this is not normal. The same, not really improvements, which is strange, because normally all my life, if I was sick, it's two, three days, maximum. Still maybe fever but nothing special.\"\n\nRublev is up to fifth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin and will next head to the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome full of confidence.\n\n\"I'm really happy. I'm really happy that I was able to perform well [in] all the matches,\" Rublev said. \"I think I showed a great level of tennis since the first match. In the end, I was able to win a title. And it now looks like everything, the last couple of weeks, couple of tournaments never happened.

I have to give full credit to the doctors. They were doing some tricky things and I was at least able to play.\n\n\"I would say this is the most proud title of my career. I was almost dead every day. I was not sleeping at night. The last three, four days I didn't sleep.\"\n\nRublev arrived in the Spanish capital on a run of four straight defeats, but the seventh seed found a rich vein of form and his run to the title included one of the biggest wins of his career over Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"No words. If you knew what I have been through the last nine days, you would not imagine that I would be able to win a title.

I've never seen this in my life, they're the best on tour.\n\n\"I would say this is the most proud title of my career.\"\n\nRublev expanded on his medical issue in an extraordinary interview with Sky Sports Tennis, as he revealed he was forced to eat baby food as his throat seized up, while he was also suffering with a foot problem.\n\n\"In the beginning of this week, starting at the weekend, I had a virus. Tomorrow we got to the hospital to check,\" he said.\n\n\"Half of my throat is blocked completely. And the first days I couldn't eat because it was burning so I had to eat baby food. It was a disaster.\n\n\"Then when I start to feel a bit better, my throat became even more inflamed. Nothing helped, so doctors were doing some injections that allowed me to go on court.\n\n\"Then I started to get inflammation on my feet that started to affect the bones. I couldn't put my feet inside the shoes.\n\n\"So this is a fairy tale week. I am so negative about myself always, but I feel so proud now.\n\n\"There are no thoughts. The last couple of nights, I'm waking up in pain, but it doesn't matter now. I can sit for the week in the hospital.\"\n\nRublev has battled with anger issues on court over the course of his career, but he suggested his illness may have helped him focus on something other than his own frustrations.\n\n\"In the end, I think it helped me,\" he added. \"I start to focus on everything because I need to save energy. I start to focus on the game. I couldn't even say 'come on' because I had no voice.\n\n\"The first matches, since the beginning of the tournament, I have felt like I played well, but then the virus came. I stay in my room every day, room service.

Asked whether he was also close to pulling out, Rublev replied: \"I mean I was because there was few issues that I couldn't fix but I don't know.\"", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yasmin_syed@express.co.uk", "name": "Yasmin Syed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seashell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seashell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/72/1200x630/5357331.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537903", "eventUri": "eng-9537903", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

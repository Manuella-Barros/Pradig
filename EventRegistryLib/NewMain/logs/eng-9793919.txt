The general practice doctor from Newcastle in New South Wales had been traveling on a camping vacation through Queensland with his wife Jane and their three sons aged 2, 5 and 7 years. Cooktown is more than 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Newcastle by road.\n\nWildlife rangers on Monday euthanized a 4.9-meter (16-foot) crocodile in a creek 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from where Hogbin disappeared. The crocodile had scars on its snout like those witnesses described seeing on a reptile in the vicinity of the disappearance, officials said.\n\nThe human remains found inside the crocodile during an examination in Cooktown were believed to be Hogbin, a police statement said. Further testing would be conducted to positively identify the remains.\n\nThe family statement corrected police reports that Hogbin had been fishing at the time he fell. He had been walking along a riverbank path five meters (16 feet) above the river when part of the bank gave way, according to his family.\n\n\"It caused Dave to fall down into the river below, and despite being tall, strong and fit, the conditions of the terrain meant Dave was unable to get himself out of the water,\" the statement said. His wife heard the splash when he fell and went to his aid, but \"due to the steepness and slipperiness of the bank, she was able to grab his arm, but soon began slipping into the river herself.\"\n\n\"Dave's final, decisive act was to let go of Jane's arm when he realised she was falling in, despite knowing she was his only lifeline. Within moments, he was taken,\" the statement added.\n\nHogbin fell at a location known as Crocodile Bend, which is popular among tourists who come to see large crocodiles.\n\nPolice Acting Chief Superintendent Shane Holmes told the media on Monday he believed Hogbin fell by accident.\n\nThe tragedy came after a 12-year-old girl was snatched on July 2 while swimming with her family in a creek in the neighboring Northern Territory. Her remains were found days later and wildlife rangers shot dead a 4.2-meter (14-foot) crocodile.\n\nThere have been three fatal crocodile attacks in Australia this year, close to the worst annual death toll on record of four in 2014. A 16-year-old boy was killed while swimming off a Queensland island on April 18.\n\nThe crocodile population has exploded across Australia's tropical north since the predators became a protected species in the early 1970s.

said her husband was \"doing everything right\" when everything changed in seconds.\n\n\"He saved me -- his last act was to not pull me in with him,\" she told News Corp.\n\nHogbin's decision to let

involved, not just the boys,\" Jane said.\n\n\"I have a lot of comfort in knowing there's nothing that I'm frustrated or angry about -- he was just walking around a corner on a well-worn path.\"\n\nWard said it was a \"small consolation\" Hogbin's three young sons did not directly see him being taken by the crocodile.\n\nNow, Jane is focused on helping them through the tragedy and keeping memories of their father alive.\n\n\"I want them to know how dedicated he was as a father -- he always jokingly offered to be a stay-at-home dad and never work again, because they were his number one priority,\" she said.\n\n\"David touched so many people's lives that everyone deserves to know who he was and how it all ended for him.\n\n\"I want to put a face to this tragedy -- someone didn't just get killed by a crocodile, we have lost a wonderful husband, father, son, brother, friend and doctor.\"\n\nHogbin's heartbroken parents and siblings told the publication they were proud of Hogbin for his \"selfless\" final moment.\n\n\"We want people to know how brave he was -- he was a hero, and the boys will always know that,\" the family said.\n\n\"It brings us some comfort to know that in the last years of Dave's life, he had never been happier.\"\n\nThe incident on Saturday sparked an extensive search, before a crocodile reportedly measuring 4.9m was captured and killed on Monday afternoon.\n\nHuman remains, believed to be Hogbin pending official confirmation, were found in the crocodile.\n\nAccording to a biography on a former employer's website, Hogbin trained in medicine at John Hunter Hospital before becoming a GP in 2018.\n\nIt said he had professional interests in paediatrics, dermatology and acute care, and enjoyed four-wheel-driving and camping with his

The general practice doctor from Newcastle in New South Wales had been traveling on a camping vacation through Queensland with his wife Jane and their three sons aged 2, 5 and 7 years. Cooktown is more than 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Newcastle by road.\n\nWildlife rangers on Monday euthanized a 4.9-meter (16-foot) crocodile in a creek 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from where Hogbin disappeared. The crocodile had scars on its snout like those witnesses described seeing on a reptile in the vicinity of the disappearance, officials said.\n\nThe human remains found inside the crocodile during an examination in Cooktown were believed to be Hogbin, a police statement said. Further testing would be conducted to positively identify the remains.\n\nThe family statement corrected police reports that Hogbin had been fishing at the time he fell. He had been walking along a riverbank path five meters (16 feet) above the river when part of the bank gave way, according to his family.\n\n\"It caused Dave to fall down into the river below, and despite being tall, strong and fit, the conditions of the terrain meant Dave was unable to get himself out of the water,\" the statement said. His wife heard the splash when he fell and went to his aid, but \"due to the steepness and slipperiness of the bank, she was able to grab his arm, but soon began slipping into the river herself.\"\n\n\"Dave's final, decisive act was to let go of Jane's arm when he realised she was falling in, despite knowing she was his only lifeline. Within moments, he was taken,\" the statement added.\n\nHogbin fell at a location known as Crocodile Bend, which is popular among tourists who come to see large crocodiles.\n\nPolice Acting Chief Superintendent Shane Holmes told the media on Monday he believed Hogbin fell by accident.\n\nThe tragedy came after a 12-year-old girl was snatched on July 2 while swimming with her family in a creek in the neighboring Northern Territory.

He wasn't doing anything wrong - in fact, he was doing everything right, and this still happened...\n\n\"He saved me - his last act was to not pull me in with him.\"\n\nPaying tribute to her husband, she described him as a dedicated father and \"fiercely loyal and protective\".\n\nA GoFundMe page set up to help support the family has raised more than A$56,600 (\u00a328,880).\n\nQueensland Police said the remains found in the crocodile would be tested further to aid identification.\n\nA report for the coroner is being prepared and the search has been suspended.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News.com.au", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "News.com.au"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queensland Police Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/135f/live/2fc00cb0-53eb-11ef-8f0f-0577398c3339.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793919", "eventUri": "eng-9793919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

But nothing can prepare you for the moment one of those tragedies hits your own family.\n\nOn Saturday, my brother-in-law Dave Hogbin was taken by a crocodile in a horrific, freak accident during a dream holiday with his young family in Far North Queensland. After an agonising two-day ordeal, his remains were finally found on Monday night.\n\nDave's final, selfless act was to save the life of Jane, his wife of 10 years, and to ensure their three beautiful boys still had their mum.\n\nToday, Jane and the family are bravely speaking out for three reasons - to clear up some misinformation that has unfortunately spread in the wake of Dave's death, to raise awareness of the dangers of the area and hopefully spare another family from this nightmare, and to make sure Australia, but most importantly, Dave's children, know exactly how amazing a man he really was.\n\nThis is what they want you to know.\n\nDave, a 40-year-old doctor from Newcastle, had been on an incredible trip with Jane, their three young sons - aged seven, five and two - and Jane's family on a 4WD and camping holiday when he was taken by a 4.9m crocodile in the Annan River near Cooktown on Saturday afternoon.\n\nHe had a passion for camping and 4WD, and exploring Australia. He had travelled extensively throughout the region - in fact, he had been in the exact same spot less than a year earlier, was cautious by nature, and was acutely aware of the dangers posed by crocodiles.\n\nContrary to initial reports, he was not fishing at the time. While walking along an established path on a 15-metre high riverbank - well out of a crocodile's striking range - it is believed a portion of the bank suddenly gave way, perhaps due to recent heavy rainfall in the area. It caused Dave to fall down into the river below, and despite being tall, strong and fit, the conditions of the terrain meant Dave was unable to get himself out of the water.\n\nBut Jane was nearby, and after hearing the splash, she slid down to desperately try and pull Dave out. Due to the steepness and slipperiness of the bank, she was able to grab his arm, but soon began slipping into the river herself.\n\nDave's final, decisive act was to let go of Jane's arm when he realised she was falling in, despite knowing she was his only lifeline. Within moments, he was taken.\n\nDave's brave decision in that terrifying moment very likely saved his wife's life, ensuring she was able to return to their boys.\n\nA small piece of consolation for the shattered family is the knowledge that, while the children were nearby, they did not witness their dad's final moments.\n\n\"David touched so many people's lives that everyone deserves to know who he was and how it all ended for him,\" Jane said.\n\n\"I want to put a face to this tragedy - someone didn't just get killed by a crocodile, we have lost a wonderful husband, father, son, brother, friend and doctor.\n\n\"We were just enjoying a standard day of our holiday and everything just changed within 30 seconds. He wasn't doing anything wrong - in fact, he was doing everything right, and this still happened. Things can change so quickly in an instant despite doing everything right.\n\n\"He saved me - his last act was to not pull me in with him. I'm glad I'm still here, because it could have been a millionfold worse for everyone involved, not just the boys.\n\n\"I have a lot of comfort in knowing there's nothing that I'm frustrated or angry about - he was just walking around a corner on a well-worn path. There's no regrets about it, because it's one of those random accidents that happen and nothing could have been done to prevent.\"\n\nFor now, Jane is focused on helping her boys and ensuring their dad's memory lives on.\n\n\"I want them to know how dedicated he was as a father - he always jokingly offered to be a stay-at-home dad and never work again, because they were his number one priority,\" she said.\n\n\"Dave was just the most calming, grounding person to have around in a crisis, and he was so loving, thoughtful, handsome, fiercely loyal and protective, and intelligent.\"\n\nJane, Dave's devastated parents Kym and Peter and siblings Chris, Mike and Bec want to thank the emergency services teams for their efforts in the search and rescue operation, and for their incredible support since Saturday.\n\nThey also have a simple message for the Australian public.\n\n\"We want people to know how brave he was - he was a hero, and the boys will always know that,\" the family said.\n\n\"He was being selfless in his final moment and we're really proud of that, even though it was putting him in danger.\n\n\"We're going to miss him, he can't be replaced, and we're super proud of him. It brings us some comfort to know that in the last years of Dave's life, he had never been happier.\n\n\"We'd now ask for some privacy as we navigate this unthinkable tragedy.\"\n\nOne of Dave's mates has set up a GoFundMe to help Jane and their three boys in the aftermath as they adjust to life without their husband and father, and to try and ease some of the immediate financial burden associated with the logistics of such a tragic event.\n\n\"Needless to say, Dave's family and friends are completely broken at the moment. But we are so incredibly lucky to have had Dave in our lives,\" the GoFundMe reads.\n\n\"Dave had achieved something that we will all strive to emulate - he realised before it was too late that he had everything he needed in life in his family, friends and the time they were able to enjoy together.\n\n\"This page has been set up, with the permission of Dave's immediate family, to ... support them while they try and navigate life without Dave. Any small amount, or simply a message of support, will be incredibly valued.\n\n\"We all miss him so much but are also immensely grateful for the love and support that we have been inundated with.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Four-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annan_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annan River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far North Queensland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooktown,_Queensland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cooktown, Queensland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cooktown, Queensland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle,_New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle, New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle, New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoFundMe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GoFundMe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Kitesailing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Kitesailing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/ac05c2e57291623711331cc7521d03f3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793919", "eventUri": "eng-9793919", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

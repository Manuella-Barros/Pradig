{"id": 231966652, "title": "Kingussie come from behind to win the MacTavish Cup for the third time in a row", "text": "Kingussie claimed a third successive cottages.com MacTavish Cup final success, dedicating the win in memory of young teammate Calum Mackintosh, after they eventually saw off a spirited Fort William side 3-1 at a rainy Eilan. Despite Kingussie\u2019s bright opening, they failed to deal with Lewis Clark\u2019s ball forward on seven minutes and Victor Smith finished from close range. Fort William\u2019s regret will be only holding onto their lead for 30 seconds as Lee Bain\u2019s surge forward from the restart picked out Savio Genini whose ball from the left fell for Liam Borthwick in front of goal and he swept the ball home. The Fort finished the first half on the attack but, the second half belonged to Kingussie, now with the wind advantage, and it took an incredible diving save from man of the match Paul MacKay to deny Liam Borthwick a second goal. Savio Genini was the match-winner, twice using both body and guile to lose his marker before scoring in his own inimitable style. Kingussie manager Iain Borthwick said: \u201cWe were all over the place at times in the first half and just couldn\u2019t get going. \u201cAt half-time, we told the boys they needed to do better and want it more and we played a lot better in second half.\u201d Kings skipper Calum Grant, who missed the game with a calf injury, raised the trophy with a symbolic otter in the cup as a poignant recall to teammate Calum Mackintosh, nicknamed \u201cThe Otter\u201d, who died of suspected heart failure at the age of 20 last year. Grant said: \u201cI was disappointed not to play but winning the trophy was the most important thing. The otter in the cup was to remember Calum Mackintosh. Calum will always be with us.\u201d In the MacTavish Juvenile Cup final, man of the match Joe Coyle bagged a brace as Newtonmore beat Skye 2-1. Ali Stewart\u2019s counter wasn\u2019t enough and More skipper Archie MacKenzie was presented with the trophy by Camanachd Association chieftain John MacKenzie. Oban Camanachd won 3-1 in their Artemis Macaulay Cup quarter-final tie against a strengthened Kyles Athletic side. After a goalless first half, substitute Ross Macmillan slipped the ball by Kyles stand-in keeper Jack Whyte, who played well in the game. Daniel MacVicar\u2019s brace came before Conor Kennedy countered at the death. Oban boss Gareth Evans said: \u201cWe were a bit passive in the first half. \u201cThe Macaulay is an important cup to us and maybe we felt the pressure a bit. The first goal was key, and Ross Macmillan delivered again.\u201d Oban Camanachd will meet Glasgow Mid Argyll in the semis as Craig Anderson scored twice in a 6-0 triumph over Bute. Calum McLay, John Sweeney, Calum Morrison and Ruairidh Ralston were also on target. Matheson hits a hat-trick Lovat are second in the Mowi Premiership after winning 4-2 against Lochaber. Greg Matheson grabbed a hat-trick and Lewis Tawse the other with Fin MacDonald and Ben Delaney replying. Lovat manager Jamie Matheson said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great performance but we\u2019re happy to get the points. \u201cWe were lucky to be level at half-time as Lochaber played really well and we were poor, but the boys did well after the restart. \u201cGreg started on the bench again. We planned to give him some minutes near the end for match sharpness, but we needed him to play longer, and he looked like he hadn\u2019t missed the last five weeks. We\u2019ll keep an eye on him and only use him when needed as we have big games coming up.\u201d Four-goal Craig Morrison helped Caberfeidh win 6-0 at Glenurquhart. Kevin Bartlett got the opener with substitute Kyle Grant completing the scoring. Inveraray raced into a 3-0 lead in their Mowi National Division match against Col Glen. Scott MacVicar and Sam Bulloch countered, but it remained 3-2. WCA National Division leaders Badenoch won 4-0 at Glenurquhart. Zoe Reid scored twice and Jeanette McGregor and Megan Ralph the others.", "summary": "Kings dedicate victory to Calum Mackintosh who died last year.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/shinty/6496909/kingussie-come-from-behind-to-win-the-mactavish-cup/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MAC_0624_0589-mlwz41sy-e1717936740408.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:52:06", "author": "Reporter", "authors": ["Reporter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.032}

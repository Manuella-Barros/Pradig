Stateside, Hampton Roads has its own budding filmmaker receiving his fair share of awards. Hunter Nickless, 15, is a student at Hickory High School in Chesapeake who studies moviemaking at the Governor\u2019s School for the Arts in Norfolk. In the past year, he\u2019s made three independent short films that have netted 41 official film festival selections. Not too shabby for a rising sophomore who prefers Hollister over Dior, non? He started asking his parents if he could model and be on TV when he was 5, but mother Dawn Nickless made him wait until he was 8. His first gig was modeling in Virginia Beach for Sunsations. The next year, he landed his first commercial. His first day on set, he loved it. He wanted more. After turning 10, Hunter booked his first co-star role for \u201cA Haunting,\u201d which was filmed in Suffolk. And while he never stopped acting \u2014 he was in two local Dominion Energy commercials this year \u2014 the teenager discovered his foremost passion three years ago. At 12, Hunter wrote and directed \u201cHaunted for Life\u201d about a boy\u2019s belief in a legend that flashing lights on Halloween are omens of evil. The film originated as a seventh grade English assignment and, with a little parental help, it was uploaded onto filmfreeway.com. The website advertises itself as the world\u2019s No. 1 way to enter film festivals and screenwriting competitions \u2014 big and small \u2014 with a single click. \u201cHaunted for Life\u201d garnered Best Young Actor and Best Young Filmmaker awards. Hunter believes he\u2019s only gotten better since studying at GSA. His most recent short films are \u201cBeyond the Gate,\u201d which centers on a group of friends who explore an abandoned school; \u201cHaunted for Life: Encounter,\u201d a sequel to his first film; and \u201cGone\u201d about a teenage boy navigating new surroundings. It premiered in April at the Indie Vegas Film Festival, where it won the Best Student Film award. Hunter aspires to make feature films, commercials and music videos. He spends his free time thinking about directing, plots and the potential of what\u2019s next. His friend, Jess, has her driver\u2019s license. Sometimes she gives him a ride in the afternoon from Chesapeake to GSA. Just last week, Jess was at the wheel as he looked out the window. His mind wondered: A driving scene? He\u2019d never filmed one of those, he thought. All new characters, in a car, flooded his mind.

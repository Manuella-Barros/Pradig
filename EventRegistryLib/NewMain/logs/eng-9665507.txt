The DMW has yet to receive details on the new search operation.\n\nThe DMW secretary and Overseas Workers Welfare Administration chief Arnell Ignacio met with the missing seafarer's family - three children, two of whom are still in school - \"just about the whole day\" on Wednesday.

On Thursday, June 20, the DMW's stance stayed the same despite the news of the MV Tutor sinking, as the seafarer's body had yet to be located.\n\nAccording to Cacdac, the MV Tutor was last seen on Monday, with its last location being near the coast of Eritrea in the southern Red Sea. Salvaging operations were supposed to commence on Tuesday, June 18, but the ship was no longer there when salvaging actors came.\n\nThere was also an oil slick reportedly spotted at around the same projected location of the ship, said Cacdac.\n\nAccording to Foreign Undersecretary for Migration Affairs Eduardo de Vega, as of Thursday afternoon, the Philippines had yet to speak with the US about White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby confirming the seafarer's death, despite this not aligning with the Philippines' belief over the status of its national.\n\n\"We will fix this,\" De Vega said in a message to Rappler.\n\nHouthis struck the Tutor with an unmanned surface vessel that damaged the engine and caused severe flooding. All but one of the 22-member Filipino crew was able to stay put in the boat's accommodations until they were rescued and repatriated to Manila on Monday.\n\nFilipino seafarers working on commercial ships have the right to refuse sailing when they are informed that their vessels will be passing through high-risk and warlike zones like the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. Cacdac said that as of Thursday, at least 78 seafarers had manifested that right.\n\nSeafarers who consent to passing through these zones are entitled to double compensation and other benefits in the event of injury or death. Cacdac said that majority of ships have diverted, but the department was assessing the operations of the ships that do not.\n\nTwo Filipinos were earlier confirmed killed in the Houthi attack on the MV True Confidence in March. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_abad@rappler.com", "name": "Michelle Abad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Migrant_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Migrant Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulk carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overseas_Workers_Welfare_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overseas Workers Welfare Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnell_Ignacio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnell Ignacio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil spill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eritrea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Eritrea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipinos", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filipinos"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rappler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources/Homework_Help", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources/Homework Help", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death_and_Funeral_Customs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Death and Funeral Customs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.rappler.com/tachyon/2024/06/2024-06-20T072058Z_1081358499_RC2VE8AJIG54_RTRMADP_3_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-YEMEN-SHIPPING-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665507", "eventUri": "eng-9665507", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 84, "textEnd": 91}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 515, "textEnd": 522, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 1066, "textEnd": 1073}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1535}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

They have received assistance from the government and have since rejoined their respective families.\n\nCacdac said authorities are conducting an investigation whether the concerned shipping company or the licensed manning agency committed any violations and will act accordingly based on their findings.\n\nThe DMW earlier directed licensed manning agencies and their accredited principals or employers to consider avoiding the passage through the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, and nearby territories.\n\nSeafarers should also be given ample time, opportunity, and means to signify their intent to either continue with the voyage or refuse to join the ship in its scheduled passage in these areas, according to the DMW. -- RF, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giselle_ombay@gmanetwork.com", "name": "Giselle Ombay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMW_Motorcycles", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DMW Motorcycles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Migrant_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department of Migrant Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bulk carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eritrea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Eritrea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_spill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oil spill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMA_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GMA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources/Homework_Help", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources/Homework Help", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://images.gmanews.tv/webpics/2024/06/Untitled5_2024_06_14_23_29_22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665507", "eventUri": "eng-9665507", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 297, "textEnd": 304}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 392, "textEnd": 399}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

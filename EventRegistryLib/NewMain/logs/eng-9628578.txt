The proposal still requires approval from state lawmakers.\n\nThe Boston City Council voted Wednesday in favor of Mayor Michelle Wu's plan to temporarily give the city the power to increase the commercial property tax rate beyond what state law allows.\n\nThe measure, which has drawn vocal opposition from the business community, was approved by an 8-4 vote. Councilors John FitzGerald, Ed Flynn, Erin Murphy, and Brian Worrell all voted against it. Councilor Julia Mejia voted present.\n\nCouncilors also approved a series of changes to Wu's proposed budget during Wednesday's meeting.\n\nWhen she introduced the property tax proposal in April, Wu argued that giving the city this power is necessary to offset the impacts of Boston's declining commercial property values.\n\n\"Boston's housing crisis means that residents are already struggling to afford to stay in our neighborhoods, and we cannot increase the burden on homeowners and renters due to an automatic shift caused by the short-term challenges in certain parts of the commercial office sector.\" Wu wrote in a letter to the City Council in April.\n\nMost of the city's services are funded through property taxes, and state law outlines the specific parameters of commercial and residential tax rates. Despite the council's vote, legislative approval is still needed, and Wu's home rule petition faces an uncertain future in the State House.\n\nThe plan would follow a five-year schedule, allowing for an increase of the commercial tax property rate by up to 200% in the first year followed by gradual decreases before returning to the current parameters. Wu said she mirrored the home rule petition on language from a precedent set by former Mayor Thomas Menino's administration in 2004. It was a success in preventing a \"shock\" to residential taxpayers at the time, she said.\n\nCouncilor Gabriela Coletta Zapata, chair of the City Council's Government Operations Committee, oversaw two hearings and one working session on the topic. In these meetings members of the Wu administration acknowledged that, even if the changes go into effect, residential property owners would still see tax increases. The goal is to give them a soft landing, and administration officials advocated for moving proactively.\n\nColetta Zapata praised the strategy, saying that the main beneficiaries would be those who own property, people that are \"house rich but cash poor.\"\n\n\"This allows us the ability, generally, and the flexibility within specific guardrails to move swiftly should we need to, to protect Bostonians. Otherwise, we're going to be back here, having the same discussion, but on an even more expedited timeline. And next time, with potentially hundreds of calls from residents wondering why the council did not act to keep their property tax bills as low as possible,\" she said.\n\nFlynn said he was opposed to any measure that would raise commercial property taxes. Boston's already-struggling downtown office market would be further hamstrung as it fights to rebound from the pandemic, he said. These office buildings could be assessed at lower values, providing the city with less tax revenue. Flynn warned about the potential for an \"urban doom loop,\" where cuts to city services would decrease Boston's desirability and further drive down property values.\n\nGreg Vasil, CEO of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, echoed these worries.\n\n\"Increasing taxes on commercial properties, an industry that has long fueled Boston's budget, and an industry facing existential challenges, is incredibly misguided, fiscally short-sighted, and ultimately will be proven to be economically problematic,\" he said in a statement. \"Instead of increasing the commercial property tax rate, city and state leaders must focus on boosting the region's competitiveness and attracting businesses. We urge officials on Beacon Hill to reject this deeply flawed policy and focus on reforms that do not punish any one industry.\"\n\nMurphy urged officials to hear from more constituents and said that the plan from the Wu administration was \"politically expedient.\" She linked this debate to other controversial actions taken by Wu, such as the failed plan to move the O'Bryant School to West Roxbury and work to overhaul White Stadium in Franklin Park.\n\nThese are \"governance problems,\" Murphy said, while drawing attention to long-simmering tensions between Wu and the city's business leaders.\n\n\"I understand the politics of it, that it plays great to the base to snub and insult the business community,\" she said. \"But we're one city, and the employers are an important part of that broader community.\"\n\nMultiple members of the City Council on the other side of the debate stressed the need to add another \"tool\" to their \"toolbox\" that can be used if necessary.\n\nCouncilor Sharon Durkan read an email she received from a resident in early January who saw their property taxes increase by more than 13% over the previous year. That resident was doubtful that they could remain in Boston amid these financial headwinds, and Durkan said she has received many similar emails.\n\n\"I hope you can hear the anger in my voice, that people aren't willing to consider this, and people aren't willing to consider a shift here,\" she said. \"This is incredibly important ... Because if we don't [pass it], we are going to get a lot more emails like that and we're going to have a lot more people that cannot afford to live in the city, cannot afford to stay in their homes.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_cristantiello@boston.com", "name": "Ross Cristantiello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Wu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Wu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Worrell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brian Worrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Flynn_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ed Flynn (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Mejia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Mejia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriela_Coletta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriela Coletta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_landing_(aeronautics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft landing (aeronautics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_State_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts State House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Menino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Menino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Park_(Boston)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin Park (Boston)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill,_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beacon Hill, Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Roxbury", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Roxbury"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Roxbury"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Property_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Property Management", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_greenhouse06BudgetTaxes2-6661ebf479b19-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628578", "eventUri": "eng-9628578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Average consumer spending in 2023 was about 96 percent of 2019 levels, but represented a small decrease from 2022. Though foot traffic overall in 2023 reached 94 percent of what was seen in 2019, specific neighborhoods, including the downtown area, the South Boston Waterfront, and the Back Bay, remain about 15 percent below 2019 levels.\n\nOfficials at Monday's briefing emphasized tourism as a key driver of the city's economic recovery, citing rising passenger numbers at Logan Airport and increasing hotel occupancy rates.\n\nThe report also acknowledged the impact of the pandemic-influenced transition to remote work and its impact on downtown.\n\nBoston's office vacancy rate hit 12 percent at the end of 2023, up from 5.3 percent during that time period in 2019, the BPDA report states, citing data from real estate analytics firm CoStar. Some local brokerages put that figure even higher: Colliers research cited a 17 percent vacancy rate for Boston offices in the fourth quarter of last year, while Newmark reported a 20.1 percent vacancy for offices in the central business district during that time.\n\nStill, officials emphasized that high commercial building vacancy rates are a nationwide problem. Downtown Boston's first-quarter office vacancy rate of 16.6 percent -- as reported by global brokerage firm CBRE -- is fourth-lowest on a list of 26 major US cities, including San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Houston, the officials said.\n\nSegun Idowu, the city's chief of Economic Opportunity and Inclusion, pointed to the city's efforts to mitigate the problem. They include a pilot program to encourage developers to convert commercial buildings into housing, launching a city office to promote the nightlife economy, and creating the SPACE grant program to help small-business owners set up shop in vacant storefronts.\n\n\"While it is a very urgent matter for the city to address, we know that we are better positioned to help address the problem than some of our partners and cities across the country,\" Idowu said.\n\nWhether those efforts are sufficient to slow or reverse the trend remains to be seen. Business, real estate, and development groups have been sounding the alarm for months about a possible continued decline in commercial property values, as some downtown office buildings have recently sold for far less than they were worth pre-pandemic.\n\nProperty taxes make up about three-quarters of the city's annual budget. Because Massachusetts communities are legally required to have a balanced budget, a significant decrease in commercial property values could mean a corresponding tax increase for residential properties to make up the difference.\n\nThe city already uses a split tax rate to reduce the tax burden on homeowners, and it taxes commercial properties the maximum rate allowed by law. But Wu is seeking City Council and the State House's approval to temporarily increase that ceiling on commercial real estate in order to ease the transition to higher residential property taxes over five years, if commercial values continue to drop.\n\nBusiness and real estate groups have rallied in opposition to the measure, which they argue will exacerbate the problem of sinking commercial property values. But Wu, Idowu, and other city leaders again defended the measure Monday as necessary to temporarily keep housing costs relatively stable for renters and homeowners, which they said would benefit businesses, as well.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc",

Wu has admitted that residential property taxes will likely still increase, even with the measure in place, but it would create a \"softer landing\" for homeowners.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic and the shift to remote work, fiscal watchdogs and business groups have raised the alarm about declining commercial property values in Boston as office vacancy rates climb. In recent months, several commercial buildings were sold for a fraction of their purchase price.\n\nProperty taxes fund about three-quarters of the city's annual budget, and because Massachusetts communities are legally required to have a balanced budget, a significant decrease in commercial property values could mean a corresponding tax hike for residential properties to make up the difference.\n\nBoston already uses a split tax rate to reduce the tax burden on homeowners, and taxes commercial property at a rate about two-and-a-half times higher than residential, the maximum allowed by law. Wu's proposal would allow the city to temporarily increase that ceiling on commercial real estate.\n\nWu has said in an ideal scenario, commercial property values remain stable and she would not need to deploy the measure. The proposal would give her the option to raise commercial property tax rates for three years.\n\nIf she does implement it, the policy would phase out over five years, which she said will help ease the transition to higher residential property taxes should commercial property values continue to decline.\n\nReal estate and development groups have mounted a fierce campaign to fight the policy, saying it would further harm an already struggling industry as well as small businesses, and accelerate a downward economic spiral in the downtown area.\n\nThe City Council is also expected to vote on the mayor's proposed budget for the next fiscal year during Wednesday's meeting.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commercial property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balanced budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Development", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Property_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Property Management", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/uQpU70fQ5OpDTrhHGosfWzNYKBo=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/2PPCZMQWQKKZCNBT342EVMUNW4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628578", "eventUri": "eng-9628578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Residential taxes would still increase and commercial taxes would still decrease, though not by as much on either front, the mayor has said.\n\nStill, opponents from the business sector argued that raising taxes on commercial properties would not only impact large corporate landlords, but has the potential to price out their small business tenants, by passing on the tax increase as higher rental costs to those restaurants and mom and pop shops. The higher shift would also exacerbate the decline in downtown commercial property values, critics said.\n\nOpposing councilors, Ed Flynn, Erin Murphy and John FitzGerald, also spoke of the need to help a struggling commercial sector, rather than implement a change that would drive businesses away, thereby impacting a city economy that is making strides, but has not fully recovered, from pandemic-era challenges.\n\n\"When did we become a city where it's businesses or residents?\" Murphy asked, speaking to the \"us versus them\" dynamic the plan arguably created. \"Aren't we better than that? Raising taxes on businesses is a really efficient way to get businesses to leave town.\"\n\nFitzGerald said the Council should instead focus on tightening up the city's budgetary spending, making use of its sizable rainy day fund, or look to create new sources of revenue, rather than rely so heavily on property taxes, which make up nearly three-fourths of annual budgetary revenue -- one-third of which comes from a commercial sector that owns far less property.\n\nCouncil Vice President Brian Worrell also voted 'no,' and although he didn't speak on the matter Wednesday, he had expressed concerns in prior committee hearings about how the plan would impact small businesses.\n\nCouncilor Gabriela Coletta Zapata, who chaired government operations committee hearings on the mayor's home rule petition, said she put forward a separate ordinance that sought to \"protect 'mom and pop' small businesses from similar commercial property tax increases by providing a larger exemption.\"\n\nColetta Zapata said, however, that the Wu administration has \"noted the lack of oversight in ensuring the exemption would successfully be passed on to the small business tenant by their landlord and expressed the need for more data.\"\n\nThe Council vote quickly drew rebukes from the MassGOP and Boston Policy Institute, but councilors who voted in favor, Liz Breadon and Sharon Durkan noted that approval of the legislation doesn't mean it has to be used, or that the city needs to shift to that full 200% option in the first year -- it would simply be a new tool.\n\nAlso voting in favor were Councilors Coletta Zapata, Tania Fernandes Anderson, Enrique Pep\u00e9n, Henry Santana, Benjamin Weber and Council President Ruthzee Louijeune.\n\nCouncilor Julia Mejia voted 'present,' thereby abstaining from taking a position.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gayla_cawley@bostonherald.com",

Although the downtown rate is lower at 90%, Idowu said that is still a \"really strong and positive indicator\" of strides that have been made with travel, tourism and foot traffic.\n\nFoot traffic is about 94% of 2019 levels citywide, and about 80% in the \"greater downtown area,\" for example, Idowu said.\n\nWhile business travel is not so hot at Logan International Airport, and may never fully recover, international travel is nearing 2019 levels, representing a substantial source of tourism revenue, Hilina Ajakaiye, executive vice president of Meet Boston, formerly the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau, added.\n\n\"It reflects the fact that our downtown is rebounding in a positive direction and that, overall, our small businesses are benefiting from residents supporting them throughout the year,\" Idowu said.\n\nWhile optimistic about the city's economic recovery, Wu and her team couldn't avoid acknowledging the dark cloud hanging over the discussion -- the declining commercial real estate values and office vacancies that have her administration pushing for a plan that would allow the city to tax businesses beyond the state limit for the next few years to avoid what the mayor says would otherwise be a \"shock\" in increased residential property taxes.\n\nWhile the proposal, which needs approval from the City Council and state Legislature, has been panned by business leaders who warn against the dreaded \"urban doom loop\" it could create by taxing a struggling commercial sector at a higher rate, Wu maintains that it will help residents, businesses and the overall economy.\n\n\"If residential taxes were to see a significant jump all of a sudden rather than a more cushioned balanced shift if that is necessary,\" Wu said, \"that would directly impact our ability to be spending at local businesses and participating in the economy or traveling and doing the things that we know are feeding right back into our economic stability.\"\n\nOn the business side, she added, employers are often telling her about how the city's high housing costs are impacting their ability to recruit and retain employees.\n\n\"So anything that would cause an immediate shock to that,\" Wu said, \"would only worsen the situation.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here's a look at the report's findings on some economic indicators:\n\nBoston gained 10,000 jobs in 2023, which pushed employment levels back to where they were in 2019, according to the report. Some sectors did better than others, however. Retail continues to lose jobs and ended 2023 with 2,391 fewer jobs than 2019, the report found. Accommodation and food services added 3,774 more jobs, but still remains below pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, health care and social assistance continues to grow and ended 2023 with 7,775 more jobs than in 2019.\n\nThe city's average unemployment rate was 3.2% in 2023 and below the national average, according to the report. That number fell to 3.1% by March of this year, the report noted.\n\nOverall average consumer spending in 2023 was 96% of what it was in 2019, according to the report. (It's worth noting, though, that when adjusted for inflation, consumer spending in 2023 actually fell compared to 2022). Consumers are spending their money on apparel and groceries, with those sectors largely recovering to 2019 levels. But, the report found, consumers are not spending at restaurants like they did before the pandemic.\n\nSome neighborhoods are also seeing more consumer activity than others. Residential neighborhoods like Jamaica Plain, Roxbury, Hyde Park, Mission Hill and West Roxbury all have higher consumer spending levels in 2023 than in 2019. Meanwhile, commercial neighborhoods like Back Bay, Fenway, Downtown and Longwood have yet to fully recover when it comes to spending. That's likely because their \"economies are more dependent on mobile populations\" whose habits have changed because of the pandemic, the report said.\n\nOf note, according to the report, is the Seaport, where consumer spending has made significant gains almost to the point of a full recovery. That may be due to increased convention activity, the report said. \"Group meetings, conventions -- we're booked up until 2037,\" Meet Boston executive vice president Hilina Ajakaiye said Monday. \"So that's back for us.\"\n\nInternational travel through Boston is now higher than it was before the pandemic, according to the report. The number of international travelers coming through Logan Airport now exceeds 2019 levels. And the report found domestic travel is back to where it was pre-pandemic.\n\nTourism has been driving the city's economic recovery, according to Segun Idowu, Boston's chief of economic opportunity and inclusion.\n\n\"\u200aThese are folks that are supporting our downtown businesses, our Seaport businesses,\" Idowu said at Monday's briefing. \"We're seeing all of this spending go not just to the commercial hubs of the city, but to our neighborhoods as well.\"\n\nBoston's hotel occupancy rates continued to improve in 2023, but are still shy of 2019 rates.\n\nOverall foot traffic across Boston reached 94% of what it was in 2019, according to the report. But foot traffic in the city's commercial hubs remains lower than that, as remote and hybrid work have altered people's commutes.\n\nDowntown Boston's foot traffic is about 84% of what is was pre-pandemic, according to the report. The city been trying to lure more people downtown through events, public art and a grant program to help small businesses fill vacant storefronts. That program has so far helped 61 entrepreneurs, mostly women and people of color, open businesses and create around 300 jobs, according to Idowu. The city is also trying to spur nightlife activity, especially downtown, to \"draw more foot traffic, more consumer spending\" and \"keep Boston open 24 hours,\" Idowu said.\n\nThe Fenway/Longwood area does stand out among the city's commercial areas. It's the only one to full recover -- and exceed -- pre-pandemic foot traffic levels. The city's healthcare hub, where jobs are more likely to be done in-person, reached 11% higher foot traffic in 2023 compared to 2019, the report found.\n\nOn the residential side, Bostonians continue to face high rents and home prices as demand for housing continues to be strong. Meanwhile, inflation and interest rates have impacted the pace of new housing production, the report found. The BPDA is working to approve more multifamily units and has a zoning initiative it hopes will bring more affordable housing across the city, according to Idowu.\n\nOn the commercials side, retail vacancy rates are among the lowest in the country at 2.15%, according to the city. But empty office spaces continue to be a challenge and have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. By the end of 2023, office vacancy rates hit 12% in Boston, according to the report. The office vacancy rate is higher downtown at 14.4%, the report found.\n\nEmpty offices are a big problem for the city. A report projected the city could lose $1.4 billion in tax revenue over the next five years due to these empty offices. Wu is now seeking a commercial property tax rate increase to prevent an increase in residential taxes -- an effort some business leaders and commercial property owners don't like. Wu said Monday that her residential tax relief effort is a \"short-term\" solution that would allow the city to \"maintain stability among the tax base that the city has.\"", "source": {"uri":

This Home Rule Petition was sponsored by Mayor Michelle Wu and is a temporary tool seeking to protect residents from property tax increases to mitigate potential revenue shortfalls from declining commercial valuations.\n\nThe proposal comes following recent reports highlighting a potential nationwide decline in commercial property valuations due to slow economic growth following the pandemic and shifting dynamics in downtown cores. The legislation would go into effect for five years and ensure that homeowners and residential property owner's taxes would not increase by upwards of 30 to 40% in one fiscal quarter.\n\nDuring the hearing, councilors once again shared concerns about the success of the proposal, potential unintended consequences and asked for additional information and data on the tax assessment for Boston.\n\n\"I foresee the main beneficiaries of this proposal being individuals that own properties that are house rich, cash poor like many of our seniors and tenants renting small properties in Boston,\" said Councilor Coletta Zapata. \"However, I'm still concerned that increases in commercial property taxes, particularly on smaller commercial property owners and small businesses, will unintentionally stifle unnecessary economic growth in Boston and hurt our small businesses. We must consider the long term impacts of our changing economy and impacts the pandemic has had on workplace vacancies and tenancies. Boston must prioritize additional sources of revenue as part of a suite of solutions for a long term plan.\"\n\nIn an effort to protect small businesses against any unintended consequences due to this proposal, Councilor Coletta Zapata has filed an ordinance to adopt the small commercial tax exemption as a local option in the City of Boston. This ordinance would provide financial relief for small businesses, valued under a million dollars or with 10 employees or less, that cannot afford the increased costs of operating in Boston.\n\nThe hearing began with public testimony from Boston residents. Councilors also heard from representatives of labor unions, Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, Urban Edge and representatives of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau, Chamber of Commerce, Ryan, LLC, Back Bay Association, and Eastern Bank.\n\nMembers of the administration present included:\n\n* Ashley Groffenberger, CFO of the City of Boston\n\n* Nicholas Ariniello, Commissioner of the City of Boston Assessing Department\n\nCouncilors in attendance included Councilors At-Large Ruthzee Louijeune, Erin Murphy, Henry Santana, Julia Mejia and District Councilors Ben Weber (District 6), John Fitzgerald (District 3), Brian Worrell (District 4), Ed Flynn (District 2), Liz Breadon (District 9), Enrique Pepen (District 5) and Tania Fernandes Anderson (District 7).\n\nA recording of the hearing can be found here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBwBaJ8UyP4\n\nThe home rule petition first needs approval from the Boston City Council then it would be sent to the State Legislature who also needs to approve it before it can take effect. A working session has been scheduled for Tuesday, June 4 at 2pm. More information can be found at www.boston.gov/public-notices/16170741.\n\nFor additional information, please contact the Office of Councilor Gabriela Coletta by phone at (617) 635-3200 or by email

His think tank rocked City Hall back in February with a report forecasting huge problems looming ahead for Boston's finances due to the pandemic-era collapse of downtown office building values as the working-from-home fad took off and stuck.\n\nThe pandemic might be over, but the implosion of this key revenue-generator is not.\n\n\"This is a tool in our toolbox to protect residents,\" said City Councilor Sharon Durkan at today's debate, where she and others argued for raising commercial tax rates rather than risk political backlash from tax-weary homeowners. \"'I'm not sure if I can afford to live here anymore, this is truly crazy.' I got this email probably times 20 in one day in the course of an hour of people being updated of their new tax bills,\" said Durkan.\n\nWhy not push wealthy but tax-exempt institutions to pay more, several councilors suggested. \"Why is it OK for Harvard not to pay property taxes on the huge amounts of land they own in Boston when our constituents in Roxbury and Charlestown and Hyde Park have to?\" asked Councilor Erin Murphy.\n\nBut a development industry spokesperson warns against killing Boston's longtime golden goose. \"In essence we're really kicking large property owners and commercial taxpayers while they're down, at a time when we really want to be drawing in tenants and businesses to our downtown to ensure we have a thriving and vibrant economy,\" says Tamara Small of NAIOP Massachusetts, the Commercial Real Estate Development Association.\n\nThe commercial tax hike option now heads to Beacon Hill for legislative approval. But in a key test for Mayor Wu, the researcher who triggered the uproar says the moment calls for maximum political creativity.\n\n\"This problem was created in a lab to hurt Boston's budget,\" says Maynard. \"Boston is just so uniquely vulnerable to this particular kind of downturn. And so that means that the response needs to be equally unique.\"\n\nThe last time this happened a decade ago with the end of the dot-com boom, then-Mayor Tom Menino did the same thing, getting Beacon Hill to ok commercial tax hikes. But Menino did something Wu is so far refusing to do, making serious cuts in the city budget and giving the green light to Seaport development that triggered a boom in city revenues.\n\nBut that boom is over for now, new development downtown has come to a halt, and the fear of some is that Wu's plan could drive investors away from Boston in search of friendlier places.", "source": {"uri":

Maura Healey before it can take effect.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz, who represents Boston's North End, has avoided taking a stance on the topic.\n\nThe home rule petition could still emerge after the July 31 end of formal sessions, but the route could be more tricky in August and beyond. Once the Legislature shifts into informal-sessions-only mode, any single lawmaker's objection can stall any item's progress.\n\nOpponents, who include the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, argue that allowing the city to increase the share of property taxes owed by commercial owners for a few years will add unnecessary burden as businesses struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"It sends the completely wrong message to businesses, especially at a time when we want to be competitive and we want to be able to provide all the necessary services property taxes provide us,\" Murphy said. \"In fact, if we were Worcester or Providence or even Charlotte, North Carolina, I'd be absolutely thrilled with this proposal.

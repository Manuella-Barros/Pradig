Knecht is coming off his final college season during which he averaged 21.7 points with the Volunteers, earned All-America honors and received shout-outs from none other than his idol, Kevin Durant.\n\nThat determination has Knecht (pronounced \"connect\") on the precipice of becoming a lottery pick in the upcoming NBA draft. The most recent Associated Press mock draft projects him as going to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 9.\n\n\"I feel like I\u00b4ve been underrated my entire life,\" Knecht said in a recent interview with the AP. \"I feel like people counted me out. Proving people wrong was my biggest thing, and always stepping on the court knowing that I\u00b4m the best player and just going out and proving it. Making sure that when the game\u00b4s over, they say Dalton was the best player.\"\n\nFriendly words of advice from his coaches travel with him, too.\n\nFrom Eddie Trenkle at Northeastern Junior College: Work harder when no one\u00b4s watching.\n\nFILE - Tennessee guard Dalton Knecht (3) reacts after a three-point basket during the second half of an Elite Eight college basketball game against Purdue in the NCAA Tournament, Sunday, March 31, 2024, in Detroit. Knecht has always carried a chip on his shoulder with him throughout his cross-country, multi-school basketball journey. he most recent Associated Press mock draft projects him going to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 9. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nFrom Steve Smiley at Northern Colorado: Be consistent every day.\n\nFrom Rick Barnes at Tennessee: Focus on the little things.\n\nFrom mom and dad, his biggest fans: Dream big.\n\nHe's melded all that together.\n\nFor being here, in this position, he credits a growth spurt that took him from 5-foot-8 in high school to 6-6 now. He also gives an assist to the lockdown defense of Zoe, the family's dog, whenever he dribbled around the house.\n\nAnd that chip.\n\nComing out of Prairie View High School in Henderson, Colorado, he didn't receive a ton of offers because, \"I didn\u00b4t have a name for myself,\" he explained.\n\nThat would change.\n\nKnecht spent two seasons at the junior college in Sterling, Colorado, earning NJCAA All-America honors his sophomore year after averaging 23.9 points.\n\nTo this day, a piece of advice from Trenkle stays with him.\n\n\"He was like, 'When people are sleeping, get yourself in the gym and work,\u00b4\" Knecht recalled.\n\nTrenkle remembered how after home games, and long after the fans filed out, Knecht would take the court again to hone an aspect of his game. For instance, a mid-range jumper.\n\n\"When you say gym rat, he\u00b4s the epitome,\" Trenkle said. \"He's fought his way to the top wherever he\u00b4s been.\"\n\nTrenkle is convinced Knecht would've landed at a Power Five school after his time in Sterling had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic. He sang the praises of Knecht to coaches any chance he got.\n\n\"I'm sure there are some people like, 'Man, I probably should\u00b4ve taken that call from Coach Trenkle,\" joked Trenkle, who's been the head coach of the Plainsmen since 2006.\n\nThat opened the door for Northern Colorado, a program which resides in the Big Sky Conference and is about an hour from where his family lived. Knecht spent two years with the Bears, winning the league's scoring title his senior season by averaging 20.2 points.\n\nHe took from Greeley the advice of Smiley.\n\n\"He told me, 'Be consistent every single day and keep growing on top of that,\u00b4\" said Knecht, who\u00b4s been invited to the draft.\n\nWith one season of eligibility left, Knecht threw his name into the transfer portal. He was sold on Tennessee after attending the spring football game on his recruiting trip.\n\n\"I wanted to go to a place where I could make a fun run in March,\" Knecht said.\n\nPlus, he wanted to play for Barnes, who coached his favorite NBA player, Durant, when the coach and player were at Texas.\n\n\"Coach Barnes is just that guy who will push everybody to their best,\" said Knecht, who's been traversing the country for predraft workouts. \"I told him when I came on my visit that I want to be pushed super-hard.\"\n\nThat demeanor pushed Knecht to new heights as he was named to the AP men\u00b4s college basketball All-America team, in addition to earning SEC player of the year accolades.\n\n\"No one could\u00b4ve projected what he\u00b4s done,\" Barnes said during the NCAA Tournament as the Volunteers advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Purdue in a game where Knecht had 37 points.\n\nHis big game against the Boilermakers and big man Zach Edey got him on the radar of LeBron James, who mentioned Knecht in an interview.\n\n\"LeBron saying my name? That\u00b4s crazy,\" Knecht recalled. \"It was a cool moment.\"\n\nSo was Durant praising Knecht after one of his numerous high-scoring contests (Knecht had eight games with 30 or more points, including 40 against Kentucky).\n\nFrom Knoxville, he will take the words of wisdom from Barnes.\n\n\"He's like, take care of the little details,\" Knecht said. \"I've just believed in myself and stayed confident. Great friends and family members have helped me as well as coaches and teammates. ... I\u00b4m ready.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\n\nFILE -Tennessee guard Dalton Knecht (3) shoots over Alabama forward Grant Nelson (2) during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game Saturday, Jan. 20, 2024, in Knoxville, Tenn.

He also gives an assist to the lockdown defense of Zoe, the family's dog, whenever he dribbled around the house.\n\nAnd that chip.\n\nComing out of Prairie View High School in Henderson, Colorado, he didn't receive a ton of offers because, \"I didn't have a name for myself,\" he explained.\n\nThat would change.\n\nKnecht spent two seasons at the junior college in Sterling, Colorado, earning NJCAA All-America honors his sophomore year after averaging 23.9 points.\n\nTo this day, a piece of advice from Trenkle stays with him.\n\n\"He was like, 'When people are sleeping, get yourself in the gym and work,'\" Knecht recalled.\n\nTrenkle remembered how after home games, and long after the fans filed out, Knecht would take the court again to hone an aspect of his game.

He sang the praises of Knecht to coaches any chance he got.\n\n\"I'm sure there are some people like, 'Man, I probably should've taken that call from Coach Trenkle,\" joked Trenkle, who's been the head coach of the Plainsmen since 2006.\n\nThat opened the door for Northern Colorado, a program which resides in the Big Sky Conference and is about an hour from where his family lived. Knecht spent two years with the Bears, winning the league's scoring title his senior season by averaging 20.2 points.\n\nHe took from Greeley the advice of Smiley.\n\n\"He told me, 'Be consistent every single day and keep growing on top of that,'\" said Knecht, who's been invited to the draft.\n\nWith one season of eligibility left, Knecht threw his name into the transfer portal. He was sold on Tennessee after attending the spring football game on his recruiting trip.\n\n\"I wanted to go to a place where I could make a fun run in March,\" Knecht said.\n\nPlus, he wanted to play for Barnes, who coached his favorite NBA player, Durant, when the coach and player were at Texas.\n\n\"Coach Barnes is just that guy who will push everybody to their best,\" said Knecht, who's been traversing the country for pre-draft workouts. \"I told him when I came on my visit that I want to be pushed super-hard.\"\n\nThat demeanor pushed Knecht to new heights as he was named to the AP men's college basketball All-America team, in addition to earning SEC player of the year accolades.\n\n\"No one could've projected what he's done,\" Barnes said during the NCAA Tournament as the Volunteers advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Purdue in a game where Knecht had 37 points.\n\nHis big game against the Boilermakers and big man Zach Edey got him on the radar of LeBron James, who mentioned Knecht in an interview.\n\n\"LeBron saying my name?

Knecht is coming off his final college season where he averaged 21.7 points with the Volunteers, earned All-America honors and received shout-outs from none other than his idol, Kevin Durant. The most recent Associated Press mock draft projects him going to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 9.\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Dalton Knecht has always packed one thing with him throughout his cross-country, multi-school basketball journey -- a chip on his shoulder.\n\nFeeling overlooked has powered the guard from Colorado along his stops at Northeastern Junior College (Colorado), Northern Colorado and Tennessee. Knecht is coming off his final college season during which he averaged 21.7 points with the Volunteers, earned All-America honors and received shout-outs from none other than his idol, Kevin Durant.\n\nThat determination has Knecht (pronounced \"connect\") on the precipice of becoming a lottery pick in the upcoming NBA draft. The most recent Associated Press mock draft projects him as going to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 9.\n\n\"I feel like I've been underrated my entire life,\" Knecht said in a recent interview with the AP. \"I feel like people counted me out. Proving people wrong was my biggest thing, and always stepping on the court knowing that I'm the best player and just going out and proving it. Making sure that when the game's over, they say Dalton was the best player.\"\n\nFriendly words of advice from his coaches travel with him, too.\n\nFrom Eddie Trenkle at Northeastern Junior College: Work harder when no one's watching.\n\nFrom Steve Smiley at Northern Colorado: Be consistent every day.\n\nFrom Rick Barnes at Tennessee: Focus on the little things.\n\nFrom mom and dad, his biggest fans: Dream big.\n\nHe's melded all that together.\n\nFor being here, in this position, he credits a growth spurt that took him from 5-foot-8 in high school to 6-6 now. He also gives an assist to the lockdown defense of Zoe, the family's dog, whenever he dribbled around the house.\n\nAnd that chip.\n\nComing out of Prairie View High School in Henderson, Colorado, he didn't receive a ton of offers because, \"I didn't have a name for myself,\" he explained.\n\nThat would change.\n\nKnecht spent two seasons at the junior college in Sterling, Colorado, earning NJCAA All-America honors his sophomore year after averaging 23.9 points.\n\nTo this day, a piece of advice from Trenkle stays with him.\n\n\"He was like, 'When people are sleeping, get yourself in the gym and work,'\" Knecht recalled.\n\nTrenkle remembered how after home games, and long after the fans filed out, Knecht would take the court again to hone an aspect of his game. For instance, a mid-range jumper.\n\n\"When you say gym rat, he's the epitome,\" Trenkle said. \"He's fought his way to the top wherever he's been.\"\n\nTrenkle is convinced Knecht would've landed at a Power Five school after his time in Sterling had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic. He sang the praises of Knecht to coaches any chance he got.\n\n\"I'm sure there are some people like, 'Man, I probably should've taken that call from Coach Trenkle,\" joked Trenkle, who's been the head coach of the Plainsmen since 2006.\n\nThat opened the door for Northern Colorado, a program which resides in the Big Sky Conference and is about an hour from where his family lived. Knecht spent two years with the Bears, winning the league's scoring title his senior season by averaging 20.2 points.\n\nHe took from Greeley the advice of Smiley.\n\n\"He told me, 'Be consistent every single day and keep growing on top of that,'\" said Knecht, who's been invited to the draft.\n\nWith one season of eligibility left, Knecht threw his name into the transfer portal. He was sold on Tennessee after attending the spring football game on his recruiting trip.\n\n\"I wanted to go to a place where I could make a fun run in March,\" Knecht said.\n\nPlus, he wanted to play for Barnes, who coached his favorite NBA player, Durant, when the coach and player were at Texas.\n\n\"Coach Barnes is just that guy who will push everybody to their best,\" said Knecht, who's been traversing the country for predraft workouts. \"I told him when I came on my visit that I want to be pushed super-hard.\"\n\nThat demeanor pushed Knecht to new heights as he was named to the AP men's college basketball All-America team, in addition to earning SEC player of the year accolades.\n\n\"No one could've projected what he's done,\" Barnes said during the NCAA Tournament as the Volunteers advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Purdue in a game where Knecht had 37 points.\n\nHis big game against the Boilermakers and big man Zach Edey got him on the radar of LeBron James, who mentioned Knecht in an interview.\n\n\"LeBron saying my name? That's crazy,\" Knecht recalled. \"It was a cool moment.\"\n\nSo was Durant praising Knecht after one of his numerous high-scoring contests (Knecht had eight games with 30 or more points, including 40 against Kentucky).\n\nFrom Knoxville, he will take the words of wisdom from Barnes.\n\n\"He's like, take care of the little details,\" Knecht said. \"I've just believed in myself and stayed confident. Great friends and family members have helped me as well as coaches and teammates. ... I'm ready.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@register-herald.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dalton, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dalton, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_Junior_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern Junior College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Northern_Colorado", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Northern Colorado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Grizzlies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Grizzlies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

He sang the praises of Knecht to coaches any chance he got.\n\n\"I'm sure there are some people like, 'Man, I probably should've taken that call from Coach Trenkle,\" joked Trenkle, who's been the head coach of the Plainsmen since 2006.\n\nThat opened the door for Northern Colorado, a program which resides in the Big Sky Conference and is about an hour from where his family lived. Knecht spent two years with the Bears, winning the league's scoring title his senior season by averaging 20.2 points.\n\nHe took from Greeley the advice of Smiley.\n\n\"He told me, 'Be consistent every single day and keep growing on top of that,'\" said Knecht, who's been invited to the draft.\n\nWith one season of eligibility left, Knecht threw his name into the transfer portal. He was sold on Tennessee after attending the spring football game on his recruiting trip.\n\n\"I wanted to go to a place where I could make a fun run in March,\" Knecht said.\n\nPlus, he wanted to play for Barnes, who coached his favorite NBA player, Durant, when the coach and player were at Texas.\n\n\"Coach Barnes is just that guy who will push everybody to their best,\" said Knecht, who's been traversing the country for pre-draft workouts. \"I told him when I came on my visit that I want to be pushed super-hard.\"\n\nThat demeanor pushed Knecht to new heights as he was named to the AP men's college basketball All-America team, in addition to earning SEC player of the year accolades.\n\n\"No one could've projected what he's done,\" Barnes said during the NCAA Tournament as the Volunteers advanced to the Elite Eight before losing to Purdue in a game where Knecht had 37 points.\n\nHis big game against the Boilermakers and big man Zach Edey got him on the radar of LeBron James, who mentioned Knecht in an interview.\n\n\"LeBron saying my name? That's crazy,\" Knecht recalled. \"It was a cool moment.\"\n\nSo was Durant praising Knecht after one of his numerous high-scoring contests (Knecht had eight games with 30 or more points, including 40 against Kentucky).\n\nFrom Knoxville, he will take the words of wisdom from Barnes.\n\n\"He's like, take care of the little details,\" Knecht said. \"I've just believed in myself and stayed confident. Great friends and family members have helped me as well as coaches and teammates. ... I'm ready.\"\n\nSports Week in Pictures: US Open golf, international soccer and more!

Charlotte has worked out Knecht, and his fit alongside LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller appears to be strong with the perimeter shooting and all-around scoring prowess he offers. If Knecht isn't picked at No. 6, it might be because a player such as Sheppard or Castle (both of whom Charlotte has worked out) became available. Buzelis worked out with Charlotte as well, along with Ja'Kobe Walter.\"\n\nKnecht took the hard path to the NBA, starting his collegiate career at Northeastern Junior College. After two years there, he transferred to Northern Colorado where he blossomed into one of the nation's premier scorers. He averaged 20.2 points in 2022-23 and instantly became the most coveted player in the transfer portal.

Knecht is coming off his final college season during which he averaged 21.7 points with the Volunteers, earned All-America honors and received shout-outs from none other than his idol, Kevin Durant.\n\nThat determination has Knecht (pronounced \"connect\") on the precipice of becoming a lottery pick in the upcoming NBA draft. The most recent Associated Press mock draft projects him as going to the Memphis Grizzlies at No. 9.\n\n\"I feel like I've been underrated my entire life,\" Knecht said in a recent interview with the AP. \"I feel like people counted me out. Proving people wrong was my biggest thing, and always stepping on the court knowing that I'm the best player and just going out and proving it. Making sure that when the game's over, they say Dalton was the best player.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He also gives an assist to the lockdown defense of Zoe, the family's dog, whenever he dribbled around the house.\n\nAnd that chip.\n\nComing out of Prairie View High School in Henderson, Colorado, he didn't receive a ton of offers because, \"I didn't have a name for myself,\" he explained.\n\nThat would change.\n\nKnecht spent two seasons at the junior college in Sterling, Colorado, earning NJCAA All-America honors his sophomore year after averaging 23.9 points.\n\nTo this day, a piece of advice from Trenkle stays with him.\n\n\"He was like, 'When people are sleeping, get yourself in the gym and work,'\" Knecht recalled.\n\nTrenkle remembered how after home games, and long after the fans filed out, Knecht would take the court again to hone an aspect of his game. For instance, a mid-range jumper.\n\n\"When you say gym rat, he's the epitome,\" Trenkle said. \"He's fought his way to the top wherever he's been.\"\n\nTrenkle is convinced Knecht would've landed at a Power Five school after his time in Sterling had it not been for the coronavirus pandemic.

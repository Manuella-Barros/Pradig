These women are fighting for change\n\nShe has been called the \"godmother of stuntwomen\" and \"the grand matron of Hollywood stuntwomen,\" working well past retirement age. At age 74, she performed stunts in the 2015 comedy \"Hot Pursuit,\" starring Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\"She certainly qualifies to be one of the greatest stunt coordinators,\" said director Steven Spielberg, who worked with Epper on \"Catch Me if You Can\" and \"Minority Report.\"\n\nShe was born Jean Luann Epper in 1941 to John and Frances Epper, both professional stunt performers. In the 1920s, Epper's father immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and established a riding academy in Los Angeles where he later became a stuntman for movies, specializing in horseback stunts and doubling for actors including Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper.\n\nJeannie Epper grew up in North Hollywood with five brothers and sisters -- all of whom worked as stunt people. Her three children and grandchildren also went into the family business.\n\nEpper was a skilled rider, and at age 9, she broke into stunt work, riding a horse bareback down a mountain for a 1950s TV show, becoming one of the first professional child stunt doubles.\n\nRead more: Legends of the Fall\n\n\"My father said it could be dangerous, but he knew I was an excellent rider,\" she told The Times in 1999. \"He kept telling me to keep my head up, but that's about all. I think he didn't want to over-concern me. There's a fine line between being concerned and destroying someone's confidence.\"\n\nThe series marked the start of Epper's game-changing career in the male-dominated industry.\n\nAlthough Epper came from a family of stunt people, it was typical when she began working for men to wear wigs while doing stunts for female actors. But thanks to persistence and shifts in attitudes and fashion, Epper changed the business.\n\n\"Actresses began saying, 'I don't want a hairy-legged guy doing this for me,'\" she told The Times in 1999. \"And women were wearing less and less clothes in front of the camera, and it was so obvious it was a man.\"\n\nLater, as a stunt coordinator, Epper recalled dealing with men who resented taking orders from a woman.\n\nWhile working on the 1980s police series \"Cagney & Lacey,\" she described a guest actor who not only couldn't throw a convincing punch but also refused to be instructed by a woman, allowing only other stuntmen on set to show him what to do.\n\nRead more: A Wonder Woman and warrior princess rise -- and fall\n\n\"He threw the punch well enough to shoot the scene,\" she said. \"But he still couldn't throw it like a man.\"\n\nIn 2019, on the occasion of being honored at the Artemis Women in Action Film Festival, Melanie Wise -- a producer, actor, stuntwoman and founder of the organization -- said of Epper, \"Jeannie inspired a wave of women to get into stunts. They are in awe of her.\"\n\nEpper was a founding member of the Stuntwomen's Assn. of Motion Pictures and an honorary member of the Stuntmen's Assn. of Motion Pictures.\n\nShe is survived by husband Tim Kimack, daughter Eurlyne Epper, son Richard Epper, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

She was 83.\n\nEpper died Sunday night of natural causes surrounded by family at her home in Simi Valley, a spokesperson confirmed Monday.\n\nIn a long career spent bursting through doors, kicking down walls and falling off roofs, Epper changed the course for women in the industry when she became Lynda Carter's stunt double on the 1970s TV series \"Wonder Woman.\" It was Epper, standing in for Kathleen Turner, who was swept down a mudslide in \"Romancing the Stone\" -- for which she received a 1985 Stuntman Award for most spectacular stunt in a feature film.\n\nIn a blond wig, Epper took the blows for Linda Evans in those iconic catfights with Joan Collins on the nighttime soap \"Dynasty.\" It's Epper's stunt-driving that audiences see when Shirley MacLaine throws Jack Nicholson from her Corvette in the movie \"Terms of Endearment.\"\n\nEpper's prolific credits include stunt work in \"The Bionic Woman,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"Robocop,\" \"The Italian Job\" and \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2.\" Epper was profiled alongside fellow stuntwoman Z\u00f6e Bell in the 2004 documentary \"Double Dare.\"\n\nShe has been called the \"godmother of stuntwomen\" and \"the grand matron of Hollywood stuntwomen,\" working well past retirement age. At age 74, she performed stunts in the 2015 comedy \"Hot Pursuit,\" starring Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\"She certainly qualifies to be one of the greatest stunt coordinators,\" said director Steven Spielberg, who worked with Epper on \"Catch Me if You Can\" and \"Minority Report.\"\n\nShe was born Jean Luann Epper in 1941 to John and Frances Epper, both professional stunt performers. In the 1920s, Epper's father immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and established a riding academy in Los Angeles where he later became a stuntman for movies, specializing in horseback stunts and doubling for actors including Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper.\n\nJeannie Epper grew up in North Hollywood with five brothers and sisters -- all of whom worked as stunt people. Her three children and grandchildren also went into the family business.\n\nEpper was a skilled rider, and at age 9, she broke into stunt work, riding a horse bareback down a mountain for a 1950s TV show, becoming one of the first professional child stunt doubles.\n\n\"My father said it could be dangerous, but he knew I was an excellent rider,\" she told The Times in 1999. \"He kept telling me to keep my head up, but that's about all. I think he didn't want to over-concern me. There's a fine line between being concerned and destroying someone's confidence.\"\n\nThe series marked the start of Epper's game-changing career in the male-dominated industry.\n\nAlthough Epper came from a family of stunt people, it was typical when she began working for men to wear wigs while doing stunts for actresses. But thanks to persistence and shifts in attitudes and fashion, Epper changed the business.\n\n\"Actresses began saying, 'I don't want a hairy-legged guy doing this for me,'\" she told The Times in 1999. \"And women were wearing less and less clothes in front of the camera, and it was so obvious it was a man.\"\n\nLater, as a stunt coordinator, Epper recalled dealing with men who resented taking orders from a woman.\n\nWhile working on the 1980s police series \"Cagney & Lacey,\" she described a guest actor who not only couldn't throw a convincing punch but also refused to be instructed by a woman, allowing only other stuntmen on set to show him what to do.\n\n\"He threw the punch well enough to shoot the scene,\" she said. \"But he still couldn't throw it like a man.\"\n\nIn 2019, on the occasion of being honored at the Artemis Women in Action Film Festival, Melanie Wise -- a producer, actor, stuntwoman and founder of the organization -- said of Epper, \"Jeannie inspired a wave of women to get into stunts. They are in awe of her.\"\n\nEpper was a founding member of the Stuntwomen's Assn. of Motion Pictures and an honorary member of the Stuntmen's Assn. of Motion Pictures.", "source": {"uri":

She was 83.\n\nEpper is perhaps most known for her time working with Lynda Carter on Wonder Woman throughout the 1970s. She served as Carter's main stunt double on the ABC and CBS series, which aired from 1975-1979, per THR.\n\nAmong her other notable work includes 1984's Romancing the Stone, which saw her star in one of her most iconic film scenes. She stood in for Kathleen Turner during a rainforest mudslide scene in the film, and she swung across a 350-foot gorge to do it, she told Entertainment Weekly in 2007.\n\nSpeaking about her line of work -- at the time, she was 66 -- she told the outlet, \"Some guys don't like to put me in a really dangerous position anymore. It hurts your pride to acknowledge that you're getting older. I've had to go through that the past few years. But I'm not emotionally ready to stop yet. My neighbors think I'm nuts.\"\n\nRelated: Wonder Woman Over the Years: See All the Stars Who've Played the Action Icon\n\nEpper came from a family of stunt performers. Her father, John Epper, starred as stand-ins for Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn and boasted over 200 film credits. Like Jeannie, her siblings all went into the stunt business, and all three of her children -- Eurlyne, Richard and Kurtis -- followed in her footsteps, too.\n\nShe did her first professional stunt when she was 9, per EW, riding a horse bareback down a cliff, and was once trapped in a burning cabin for a 1960s Western TV show called Lancer, resulting in all her hair being \"burned off.\"\n\nIn 2007, she became the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Taurus World Stunt Awards, the field's most prestigious award, and her final stunt credit came in 2021 at the age of 80.\n\nAlong with her 161 stunt credits, she was a member of the group of stunt performers who Steven Spielberg nicknamed the \"Flying Wallendas of Film,\" and in the 2004 documentary Double Dare, which told her story as a stunt woman, along with others in the industry, Spielberg recalled working with her in the '70s on 1941.\n\n\"In the bar fight in 1941, there were Eppers flying all over the place,\" he said in the documentary, per THR. \"There were Eppers coming in from screen left, Eppers coming in from screen right, they were everywhere.\"\n\nRelated: Paying Tribute to the Celebrities

I had blond hair, the blood was running down, they kept the camera right on me,\" she told Dan Rather for a CBS Sunday Morning segment in 1979.\n\nIn 2000, she donated a kidney, possibly saving the life of good friend Ken Howard. \"It's very humbling when someone gives you a part of themselves to keep you alive,\" the actor said three years later. \"Thankful doesn't seem to quite make it.\"\n\nEpper served as Carter's main stunt double on Wonder Woman, which aired on ABC and CBS from 1975-79 (Debbie Evans and Kitty O'Neil were among those who also suited up for the star). She learned how to mimic Carter's running gait and did most of the superhero's fighting and signature jumping on the show.\n\nEpper spent about 11 weeks in a remote Mexican rainforest on Romancing the Stone (1984), starring Turner and Michael Douglas. She rehearsed the mudslide scene with Douglas' stunt double, Vince Deadrick Jr., two or three times a day for a couple of weeks.\n\nWhen Deadrick once landed with his head between her open legs in a pool of mud at the bottom of the slide, director Robert Zemeckis decided to carry that over to the movie, and it made for one of the film's funniest moments.\n\nFor her trip across the gorge, stunt coordinator Terry Leonard rigged the cable used in the stunt to a tree, he explained to Entertainment Weekly in 2007.\n\n\"And when we did a test, the tree pulled right out of the ground because it had rained so much in Mexico. It went crashing down into the canyon,\" he recalled. \"Something like that will take away your confidence pretty quickly. But Jeannie, she just stepped up and did it when it was time.\"\n\nOne of six children -- three girls and three boys -- Jean Luann Epper was born in Glendale on Jan. 27, 1941, and raised in North Hollywood. Will Rogers' horse, Trigger, was stabled down the street from the family home on Longridge Avenue.\n\nHer charismatic father was a former officer with the Swiss Cavalry who doubled for the likes of Gary Cooper (The Westerner), Errol Flynn (The Charge of the Light Brigade), Randolph Scott (Western Union) and Ronald Reagan (Santa Fe Trail) in more than 200 movies. Her mother, Frances, was a homemaker.\n\nWhen she was 9, Jeannie performed her first stunt, riding a horse bareback down a cliff, and appeared in her first film, Elopement (1951), starring Clifton Webb and Anne Francis. At 13, she left for Switzerland for 2 1/2 years at finishing school.\n\nShe returned home and received her first credit on Cheyenne Autumn (1964), directed by John Ford. And during the four-season run of The Big Valley, she was on the set almost every day, also stepping in occasionally for Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nThis was a time in Hollywood when men would double for women.\n\n\"It wasn't until sexy ladies like Linda Evans and Lynda Carter said we didn't want hairy-legged boys doubling for us anymore,\" Epper said in a 2014 conversation for the TV Academy Foundation website The Interviews. They said, 'These girls are just as good as the guys, only they have shaved legs and don't have hairy armpits.'\"\n\nOn Lancer, starring Wayne Maunder, Epper stood in for an actress whose character was clutching a doll while trapped in a burning cabin. Before the scene, the director told Jeannie, \"'Whatever you do, don't let go of the doll,'\" she told EW. Before she knew it, beams on fire were crashing all around her.\n\n\"When I woke up in the hospital, all my hair was burned off,\" she said, \"but I still had that little doll in my hands. You should have seen that doll, too. It was all fried up. We both were.\"\n\nAll in all, however, she managed to avoid serious injury during her career.\n\nIn The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972), Epper and her two sisters, Margo and Stephanie, played slimy hookers who grab at and then beat up Paul Newman. Later in the movie, she is seen in a red wig jumping on a horse and getting the heck out of town.\n\nWhen she was 69, she jumped a car through fire and landed it safely for a 2010 commercial and was 80 when she received her final stunt credit.\n\nEpper was a founding member of the Stuntwomen's Association of Motion Pictures, launched in 1968, and served as its president in 1999. And in 2004, she and fellow stunt performer Zo\u00eb Bell were featured in Amanda Micheli's documentary Double Dare, which screened at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nSurvivors include her fourth husband, Tim; her children, Eurlyne and Richard, both in the stunt business (another son and stuntman, Kurtis, predeceased her); five grandchildren, including Christopher, a stuntman; and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHer siblings, Tony, Margo -- she was in the window as Mrs. Norma Bates in Psycho and appeared in the film's iconic shower scene oh-so briefly -- Gary, Andy and Stephanie all worked in stunts and died before her.\n\n\"In the bar fight in 1941,\" Spielberg says in Double Dare, \"there were Eppers flying all over the place. There were Eppers coming in from screen left, Eppers coming in from screen right, they were everywhere.\"\n\nIn Scott McGee's 2022 book Danger on the Silver Screen, Epper is quoted as saying that stunt work \"empowers me, it gives me a sense of great accomplishment and control ... as a woman, when you pull off something that only men do, it raises respect for all women. It opens the door for women to do all kinds of things.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A graduate of Northwestern University, she has been working at PEOPLE since 2022.\n\nJeannie Epper, one of the world's best-known stuntwomen, has died.\n\nEpper's family confirmed the death to The Hollywood Reporter, sharing that she died of natural causes at her home in Simi Valley, California on May 5. She was 83.\n\nEpper is perhaps most known for her time working with Lynda Carter on Wonder Woman throughout the 1970s. She served as Carter's main stunt double on the ABC and CBS series, which aired from 1975-1979, per THR.\n\nAmong her other notable work includes 1984's Romancing the Stone, which saw her star in one of her most iconic film scenes. She stood in for Kathleen Turner during a rainforest mudslide scene in the film, and she swung across a 350-foot gorge to do it, she told Entertainment Weekly in 2007.\n\nSpeaking about her line of work -- at the time, she was 66 -- she told the outlet, \"Some guys don't like to put me in a really dangerous position anymore. It hurts your pride to acknowledge that you're getting older. I've had to go through that the past few years. But I'm not emotionally ready to stop yet. My neighbors think I'm nuts.\"\n\nEpper came from a family of stunt performers. Her father, John Epper, starred as stand-ins for Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn and boasted over 200 film credits. Like Jeannie, her siblings all went into the stunt business, and all three of her children -- Eurlyne, Richard and Kurtis -- followed in her footsteps, too.\n\nShe did her first professional stunt when she was 9, per EW, riding a horse bareback down a cliff, and was once trapped in a burning cabin for a 1960s Western TV show called Lancer, resulting in all her hair being \"burned off.\"\n\nIn 2007, she became the first woman to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Taurus World Stunt Awards, the field's most prestigious award, and her final stunt credit came in 2021 at the age of 80.\n\nAlong with her 161 stunt credits, she was a member of the group of stunt performers who Steven Spielberg nicknamed the \"Flying Wallendas of Film,\" and in the 2004 documentary Double Dare, which told her story as a stunt woman, along with others in the industry, Spielberg recalled working with her in the '70s on 1941.\n\n\"In the bar fight in 1941, there were Eppers flying all over the place,\" he said in the documentary, per THR. \"There were Eppers coming in from screen left, Eppers coming in from screen right, they were everywhere.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's

She was 83 years old. During her long career, Epper doubled Lynda Carter on Wonder Woman, Kathleen Turner in Romancing the Stone, and more than 100 other movies and TV shows. According to The Hollywood Reporter, who first reported her death, Epper passed away at her home in California due to natural causes. She represents the second generation (of four) of Epper to act as stunt performers on film, beginning with her father, John Epper. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg has called the Eppers \"the flying Wallendas of film,\" a reference to a family of circus daredevils and acrobats.\n\nEpper, whose career spanned nearly 70 years, was the first woman ever to receive a lifetime achievement honor from the World Taurus Awards, a yearly award that celebrates stunt performers in film. Epper worked consistently until 2015, with her final film credit being Hot Pursuit. In 2021, at age 80, she got her final credit, doing stunts for the video game Ground Zero Texas: Nuclear Edition.\n\nEpper is one of the best-known women to work as a stunt performer and, by her own recollection, rose to prominence in part because Hollywood finally stopped using men to double women for stunts in the 1970s.\n\n\"It wasn't until sexy ladies like Linda Evans and Lynda Carter said we didn't want hairy-legged boys doubling for us anymore,\" Epper is quoted as saying in the THR piece. \"They said, 'These girls are just as good as the guys, only they have shaved legs and don't have hairy armpits.'\"\n\nDuring the course of her long career, Epper appeared in some of the biggest hits in Hollywood. She also cultivated relationships that gave her opportunities to work with the same people again and again, from Spielberg -- she worked for him on Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), 1941 (1979), Poltergeist (1982), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Minority Report (2002), and others -- and Linda Evans. Epper doubled Evans in both The Big Valley, which ran on ABC in the 1960s, and Dynasty in the 1980s.\n\nOther notable roles include Romancing the Stone, in which she famously leapt across a gorge while holding onto a vine; Earthquake (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), Smokey and the Bandit II (1980), The Cannonball Run (1981), Blade Runner (1982), Road House (1989), Total Recall (1990), The Fugitive (1993), Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995), Con Air (1997), Rush Hour 2 (2001), The Italian Job (2003), Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012).\n\nOur condolences go out to Epper's family, friends, colleagues, and fans.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [],

She was 83.\n\nEpper died Sunday night of natural causes surrounded by family at her home in Simi Valley, a spokesperson confirmed Monday.\n\nIn a long career spent bursting through doors, kicking down walls and falling off roofs, Epper changed the course for women in the industry when she became Lynda Carter's stunt double on the 1970s TV series \"Wonder Woman.\" It was Epper, standing in for Kathleen Turner, who was swept down a mudslide in \"Romancing the Stone\" -- for which she received a 1985 Stuntman Award for most spectacular stunt in a feature film.\n\nIn a blond wig, Epper took the blows for Linda Evans in those iconic catfights with Joan Collins on the nighttime soap \"Dynasty.\" It's Epper's stunt-driving that audiences see when Shirley MacLaine throws Jack Nicholson from her Corvette in the movie \"Terms of Endearment.\"\n\nEpper's prolific career includes stuntwork in \"The Bionic Woman,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"Robocop,\" \"The Italian Job\" and \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2.\" Epper was profiled alongside fellow stuntwoman Z\u00f6e Bell in the 2004 documentary \"Double Dare.\"\n\nEpper has been called the \"godmother of stuntwomen\" and \"the grand matron of Hollywood stuntwomen,\" working well past retirement age. At age 74, she performed stunts in the 2015 comedy \"Hot Pursuit,\" starring Sofia Vergara and Reese Witherspoon.\n\n\"She certainly qualifies to be one of the greatest stunt coordinators,\" said director Steven Spielberg, who worked with Epper on \"Catch Me If You Can\" and \"Minority Report.\"\n\nShe was born Jean Luann Epper in 1941 to John and Frances Epper, both professional stunt performers. In the 1920s, Epper's father immigrated to the United States from Switzerland and established a riding academy in Los Angeles, where he later became a stuntman for movies, specializing in horseback stunts and doubling for actors including Ronald Reagan and Gary Cooper.\n\nJeannie Epper grew up in North Hollywood with five brothers and sisters -- all of whom worked as stuntpeople. Her three children and grandchildren also went into the family business.\n\nEpper was a skilled rider, and at age 9, she broke into stuntwork, riding a horse bareback down a mountain for a 1950s TV show, becoming one of the first professional child stunt doubles.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

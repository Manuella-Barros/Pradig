Tinubu's motorcade arrived at the National Assembly at about 11:57am and he's yet to enter the chamber. Shortly after the president\u2019s arrival, the Speaker of the House, Abbas Tajudeen, alongside the Senate President, Godswill Akpabio, entered the chamber. Mr Akpabio announced that the President would not address the chamber but only listen to the Old National Anthem. He urged the lawmakers to download the new anthem. However, the President, thereafter, made a brief speech to the lawmakers. This is coming amid confusion from the Presidency over conflicting statements of Tinubu addressing a joint session of the National Assembly. On Monday, the National Assembly had announced that it would hold a special joint session on Wednesday to mark the 25th anniversary of democracy in Nigeria.", "summary": "<img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tinubu-4-1200x900-1-1.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tinubu-4-1200x900-1-1.jpg 1200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tinubu-4-1200x900-1-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tinubu-4-1200x900-1-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><p>President Bola Tinubu has arrived at the National Assembly Complex as part of his itinerary to commemorate the 25 years of unbroken democracy in Nigeria.

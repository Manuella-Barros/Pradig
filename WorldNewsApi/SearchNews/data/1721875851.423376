Tech giants, having nearly exhausted publicly available English data sources, are now turning to personal electronic devices and social media to train AI models. This shift has sparked public discomfort, with fears of privacy invasion gaining traction. In a recent example of the trend, Apple unveiled significant advancements in AI, particularly with regard to its digital assistant, Siri. At the conference, Apple announced that it has also partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT directly into Siri, leveraging GPT-4 as the underlying AI engine. In the conference\u2019s keynote address, Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, stressed the importance of data privacy in the context of AI. Traditionally, Apple has protected that privacy with on-device data processing, which keeps data on the device rather than transmitting it to external servers. Mr. Musk\u2019s critique extended to the transparency of data handling between Apple and OpenAI. He dismissed the notion that Apple could monitor how OpenAI uses the data once transferred. OpenAI had allegedly approached Ms. Johansson seeking to use her voice for the AI, an offer she declined. Months later, Ms. Johansson and others noticed the resemblance, which she claimed shocked and angered her, leading her to seek legal counsel. OpenAI has since paused the use of the Sky voice and denied that it was intended to mimic the actress\u2019s voice, citing privacy reasons for not disclosing the actual voice actor\u2019s identity. The incident sparked discussions about ethical standards in AI voice replication. Users would be able to opt out of having their data used to train Llama, Meta stated. In an email to Facebook and Instagram users, the company said: \u201cYou have the right to object to how your information is used for these purposes. If your objection is honoured, it will be applied from then on.\u201d Concerns about these practices prompted NOYB, a European digital rights advocacy group, to file complaints with 11 national privacy watchdogs about Meta\u2019s AI training plans, according to a June 6 announcement from the nonprofit organization. As a result of the complaints, the Irish Data Protection Commission, Meta\u2019s lead regulator, asked the tech company to pause the scheme to train Llama on social media content. In an update on June 14, Meta expressed disappointment and called the pause \u201ca step backwards for European innovation.\u201d Satoru Ogino, a Japanese electronics engineer, said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) uses \u201cAI to generate misinformation and shape public opinion.\u201d The clandestine operations spanned several countries, including Russia, China, and Iran, and even involved a private Israeli company. They leveraged the capabilities of OpenAI\u2019s advanced language models for a variety of purposes: from generating fake reviews and articles to creating social media profiles and from assisting in programming and debugging robotics to translating and proofreading texts. The report specifically highlighted China\u2019s Spamouflage campaign, which employed AI to monitor public social media activities. This operation generated counterfeit messages in multiple languages, including Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean, spreading them across platforms such as X, Medium, and Blogspot. Their activities extended to managing databases and manipulating website codes, exemplified by their use of the obscure domain revescum[.]com. Russia\u2019s Bad Grammar group and Doppelganger operations, along with the International Union of Virtual Media from Iran, were also named for their misuse of AI to disseminate false news and extremist content in various languages. Their propaganda efforts spanned several digital platforms, including Telegram, X, and Facebook. The comprehensive study outlined how the CCP\u2019s propaganda machine uses privately owned Chinese companies in sectors such as mobile gaming, AI, virtual reality, and overseas online retail platforms. These entities collect extensive data on individuals both within China and globally. That data is then used to tailor and propagate CCP-aligned narratives.", "summary": "Commentary As the digital era advances, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with consumer technology is raising significant ethical concerns.

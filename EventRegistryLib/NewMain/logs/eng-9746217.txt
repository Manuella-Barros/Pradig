Speaking at a Financial Express event, Das highlighted the risks of conflicts of interest and related-party transactions that such permissions could entail.\n\n\"There is no consideration at this point to allow business houses to promote banks,\" Das confirmed in response to a query. Historically, the RBI has disqualified numerous conglomerates from starting banks, notably during the last round of licensing nearly a decade ago.\n\nThe topic resurfaced in 2020 when an RBI working group suggested that corporate involvement could bring in much-needed capital to support India's growth objectives. However, Das highlighted the unique nature of banking compared to other businesses, pointing to global experiences of conflict and regulation challenges when business houses are involved in banking.\n\nReflecting on India's history, Das mentioned the pre-nationalisation era of the late 1960s, when business houses were involved in banking, leading to significant regulatory difficulties.\n\n\"Global experience shows that monitoring and regulating related-party transactions is extremely challenging, with high associated risks,\" Das remarked. He stressed that while economic growth requires resources, increasing the number of banks is not the solution. Instead, India needs \"sound, healthy, and well-governed banks\" capable of leveraging technology to mobilise savings and meet credit demands.\n\nDas also noted that the RBI has made the licensing process for universal banks an ongoing one, encouraging applications. He highlighted the rapid growth of the private credit space as an attractive investment for those with a high-risk appetite but warned of the potential financial stability concerns due to vulnerabilities and interconnectedness in these markets.\n\n\"Currently, risks seem contained, but it's crucial to be mindful of the potential for amplified negative shocks,\" Das added.\n\nDas said the RBI's relations with the government have been \"smooth\" during his nearly six-year term, and credited the close coordination between the two for the quick revival of the economy after the pandemic. \"I am saying from my experience.

June\n\nThe Indian central bank's target is to bring down inflation to 4% and though it looks at the real and neutral rates in the economy, those cannot be determinants of monetary policy, Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.\n\n\"Neutral rate and all are theoretical, abstract concepts that cannot determine policy in the real world,\" Das said at an event organised by the Financial Express newspaper.\n\nOn Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India said the economy's neutral or natural rate of interest has increased since the pandemic and will rise further, driven by the growth of potential output.\n\nThe RBI in its monthly bulletin estimated the neutral rate was 1.4-1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023-24, higher than 0.8-1.0% estimated in the third quarter of 2021-22.\n\n\"So even if you were to argue that real rates are high, that is not so,\" Das said, referring to the latest study.\n\nThe RBI chief reiterated the bank's commitment to bringing down inflation to its 4% target while keeping in mind the objective of growth.\n\n\"Growth is holding steady, so now we have to focus clearly and unambiguously on inflation,\" he said, adding that growth momentum has been robust even in the current quarter.\n\nDas said urban consumption has been doing well in recent quarters while rural consumption has also picked up in recent months and is expected to improve amid good monsoon and agricultural prospects.\n\nHe added that inflation was on a downward trajectory despite the recent uptick to 5.1% in June on the back of a spike in seasonal vegetable prices, which would need to be monitored.\n\nSeparately, Das asked banks and non-banks to use their regulatory freedom \"responsibly\" to maintain fair and transparent pricing of small-value loans.\n\nUnfair practices on microfinance loans would \"compel us to have a re-look at the revised regulatory framework for microfinance loans, which were issued in March 2020,\" he added.\n\nPrivate credit as a preferred alternative mode of capital mobilisation is growing rapidly and is emerging as an attractive investment avenue for investors with high-risk appetite, Das said.\n\n\"While risks appear to be contained

It can be noted that the RBI has been steadfastly maintaining the status quo on interest rates, and there is increasing dissent among some members of the rate-setting panel who are in favour of rate cuts to promote economic growth lately. Replying to those who flag the impact on growth because of the elevated interest rates, Das said that the growth has been robust even with the current interest rates and added that RBI is optimistic that its 7.2 per cent real GDP expansion estimate for FY25 is being achieved.\n\nMoreover, the nowcast team is pointing towards a 7.4 per cent growth in the June quarter as against the monetary policy committee's expectation of 7.3 per cent, he said, adding that the momentum will continue into the Q2 as well.\n\nIn the last three years, the average growth of India has been 8.3 per cent, he said.\n\n\"Growth is remaining steady. Now, we have to focus clearly and unambiguously on inflation,\" he said, speaking at an event organised by the Financial Express here.\n\nDrawing from his favourite analogy of the elephant in the forest, wherein he compares the animal to inflation, Das said the elephant is \"grudgingly\" moving towards the forest, which is the 4 per cent inflation target.\n\nThe movement down to the target is unidirectional, but there are pauses taken by the distracted 'elephant' who is moving slowly towards the 'forest', Das said.\n\nDas said the RBI is looking specifically on the food inflation front, and also if there is a spillover of - Wholesale Price Inflation (WPI), which moved up to a 16-month high for June into consumer price inflation.\n\n\"It is the food inflation which is drawing our greatest attention because that is actually giving the push to the headline numbers because core and fuel inflation are quite low.

The risks involved are very high,\" Das said.\n\nHe said, while the economy needs the resources to grow, we do not necessarily require more banks to achieve the aspirations.\n\n\"What India needs is not proliferation in the number of banks, India needs sound banks, healthy banks, well governed banks which we feel will be able to mobilize savings throughout the country through technology and meet the credit requirements,\" he said.\n\nDas said that licensing of universal banks has been made on tap and added that applications are welcome.\n\nDas said that the private credit space is growing rapidly and emerging as an attractive investment avenue for those with high risk appetite at present, and added the RBI is monitoring developments there.\n\n\"While risks appear to be contained at present, it is important to bear in mind that vulnerabilities and interconnectedness in these markets can amplify negative shocks and pose financial stability concerns,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "money.rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktikanta_Das", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaktikanta Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Financial_Express_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Financial Express (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/money/2023/may/24das.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746217", "eventUri": "eng-9746217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 274, "textEnd": 280}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He advised prudence to such banks and added that they should avoid exuberance.", "source": {"uri": "newsonair.gov.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "newsonair.gov.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "site_admin@newsonair.gov.in", "name": "Site Admin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktikanta_Das", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaktikanta Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-bank financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payment system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746217", "eventUri": "eng-9746217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

neutral rates in the economy, those cannot be determinants of monetary policy, Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.\n\n\"Neutral rate and all are theoretical, abstract concepts that cannot determine policy in the real world,\" Das said at an event organised by the Financial Express newspaper.\n\nOn Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India said the economy's neutral or natural rate of interest has increased since the pandemic and will rise further, driven by the growth of potential output.\n\nThe central bank in its monthly bulletin estimated the neutral rate was 1.4-1.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023-24, higher than 0.8-1.0% estimated in the third quarter of 2021-22.\n\n\"So even if you were to argue that real rates are high, that is not so,\" Das said, referring to the latest study.\n\nThe RBI chief reiterated the bank's commitment to bringing down inflation to its 4% target while keeping in mind the objective of growth.\n\n\"Growth is holding steady, so now we have to focus clearly and unambiguously on inflation,\" he said, adding that growth momentum has been robust even in the current quarter.\n\nDas said urban consumption has been doing well in recent quarters while rural consumption has also picked up in recent months and is expected to improve amid good monsoon and agricultural prospects.\n\nHe added that inflation was on a downward trajectory despite the recent uptick to 5.1% in June on the back of a spike in seasonal vegetable prices, which would need to be monitored.\n\nSeparately, Das asked banks and non-banks to use their regulatory freedom \"responsibly\" to maintain fair and transparent pricing of small-value loans.\n\nUnfair practices on microfinance loans would \"compel us to have a re-look at the revised regulatory framework for microfinance loans, which were issued in March 2020,\" he added.\n\nPrivate credit as a preferred alternative mode of capital mobilisation is growing rapidly and is emerging as an attractive investment avenue for investors with high-risk appetite, Das said.\n\n\"While risks appear to be contained at present, it is important to bear in mind that vulnerabilities and interconnectedness in

As on June 28, 2024, bank credit growth was at 13.9% year-on-year while deposit growth was at 10.6% over the same period, latest RBI data showed. The data exclude the impact of the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank.\n\nSpeaking in the context of banking collapses in the US and Switzerland last year following an abrupt increase in global interest rates, Das said that the incidents had triggered debates about the design of the Basel liquidity standards which had been created after the global financial crisis of 2007-08.\n\nReferring to an ongoing review of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) for banks, the RBI governor exhorted banks to put in place prudent liquidity management practices.\n\n\"It has to be borne in mind that incorrect valuation of liquid assets can give a fall sense of short-term liquidity resiliency, which is not desirable,\" he said, adding that such issues were applicable to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) too.\n\nLCR refers to a stock of high-quality liquid assets - primarily government securities - that banks must maintain in order to tide over a hypothetical 30-day stress scenario in which outflows occur. ET had reported last month that the RBI had recently carried out a special audit for banks' LCR maintenance.\n\nIn response to a question about inflation and interest rates, Das reiterated that the RBI's aim was to ensure that headline retail inflation durably goes to the central bank's 4% target. He emphasised the role that declining inflation would play in freeing up consumption in rural areas and contribute to stable economic growth.\n\n\"The whole idea of bringing down inflation is to reduce the burden on the people... if you measure - today the inflation is at 5.0-5.1%,\" he said.\n\n\"Just measure, quantify, if the inflation goes to let us say 4%, that 1% difference and that 1% additional money which will be available, if you just try to extrapolate on that basis, how much of disposable surplus will be left in the hands of the people.\"\n\nResponding to a query about the appropriate level of real interest rates, Das referred to a recent article by an RBI economist which said that the neutral rate of interest in India had gone up after the pandemic in tandem with higher potential growth.\n\n\"So even if you were to argue that the real rates are high, it's not so because the real rates - the range is 1.4-1.9%,\" Das said. In the Monetary Policy Committee's June meeting, two external members of the rate-setting panel voted for a rate cut, arguing that high real rates could hurt growth.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktikanta_Das", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaktikanta Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_intermediary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial intermediary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-bank financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Basel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111870856,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-124188,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746217", "eventUri": "eng-9746217", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Today, the number of banks and their branches have become less relevant because the reach is being achieved through technology (customer connect and reaching the far-flung areas), it is also being achieved through several new business models (for example, the BCsl or the handheld devices which they carry).\n\n\"So, therefore, what India needs is not proliferation in the number of Banks. What it needs is sound, healthy and well-governed banks, which, we feel, will be able to mobilise savings and also meet the credit requirements throughout the country through technology,\" Das said in a fireside chat organised by a financial publication.\n\nAlso read: Only 6% of total \u20b93.68-lakh crore loans under ECLGS are bad debts\n\nHe noted that there are new players, especially in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector, who are entirely digital lenders. The RBI has come out with detailed guidelines for this category of lenders.\n\n\"Having said that I would like to say that we are open to receiving new applications for setting up universal banks. And, as and when, an appropriate \"fit and proper\" application comes, the RBI will not hesitate.\n\n\"I am not implying for a moment that today's number of banks is enough and no more license will be granted...I am not suggesting that. All that I am saying is that if applications are received, certainly we will examine and take a call,\" Das said.\n\nThe Governor emphasised that Banks are different from other businesses.\n\nIn reply to a question whether RBI is reluctant to give license to corporates, Das observed that \"Experience world over has shown that when real sector companies enter the banking space, there are potential conflicts of interest. Also, related party transactions (RPTs) is a major issue.\n\n\"Experience world over has shown that it will be very difficult to monitor or regulate or prevent RPTs. So, the risks involved are very high.\"\n\nTherefore, world over, although there is no specific bar, for example in the US or the Emerging Market Economies, this has not been done. And there are good reasons why it has not been done.\n\nDas said at this point there is no thinking about allowing corporates to enter banking.\n\nAlso read: Need to stay the course on the straight and narrow path of aligning inflation with 4% target: RBI bulletinSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on July 19, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaktikanta_Das", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaktikanta Das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-bank financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Other Backward Class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_chats", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireside chats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/todays-paper/tp-news/oymqm7/article68408134.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/RBI-asks-lenderG9KD2EOPK.4.jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9746217", "eventUri": "eng-9746217", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 2679, "textEnd": 2686}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The RBI's latest estimates suggest the economy's neutral interest rate climbed to between 1.4-1.9% in Q4 2023-24 from 0.8-1.0% in Q3 2021-22, challenging claims of relatively high real rates. The commitment to a 4% inflation target is unwavering, despite a 5.1% rise in June, driven by seasonal vegetable prices. Urban consumption shows robust growth, while rural spending is expected to rise thanks to favorable monsoons and agricultural prospects. Das also urged responsible lending among banks and non-banks, warning of potential reviews of microfinance loan regulations in case of unfair practices. Furthermore, private credit is emerging as a viable capital mobilization strategy but comes with potential risks and market vulnerabilities.\n\nThe RBI's steadfast goal to bring inflation down to 4% while balancing growth could impact everything from borrowing costs to investment strategies. With private credit becoming a hot pick for risk-hungry investors, it's essential to stay aware of how these shifts might reverberate through the financial system and affect market stability.\n\nThe bigger picture: Navigating economic crossroads.\n\nIndia's rising neutral rate and urban-rural consumption patterns reflect broader economic trends.

He also credited the close co-ordination between the two for the quick revival of the economy after the pandemic.\n\nDrawing from his favourite analogy of the elephant in the forest, wherein he compares the animal to inflation, Das said the elephant is \"grudgingly\" moving towards the forest, which is the 4 per cent inflation target.\n\nThe movement down to the target is unidirectional, but there are pauses taken by the distracted 'elephant' who is moving slowly towards the \"forest\", Das said.\n\nDas, who has poured cold water on hopes of an early rate cut in the recent past, said that the RBI's relations with the Centre was \"smooth\" - arguably the first time that he has commented on a very sensitive subject.\n\nFormer governor Duvvuri Subbarao had a running battle with finance minister P. Chidambaram and Kaushik Basu from 2011 onwards as he resisted pressure to cut rates and pump prime the Indian economy after the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\n\"I am saying from my experience. Nobody expects RBI to be a cheerleader.

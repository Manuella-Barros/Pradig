{"id": 231936110, "title": "Man Utd and Liverpool flops among string of targets for Cesc Fabregas at Como", "text": "Cesc Fabregas has helped guide Como into the Italian top flight (Picture: Getty Images) Cesc Fabregas is hoping to bring in a number of familiar names to Como after promotion to Serie A, including former Manchester United and Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and ex-Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius. Como are back in the Italian top flight after 21 years away, thanks to head coach Osian Roberts and his right hand man Fabregas. It will be a big step up for I Lariani and Fabregas is looking to delve into his book of contacts to help Como make the transition to Serie A. Gazzetta report that Como\u2019s shopping list is a long one and it includes Sanchez and Karius, who are both free agents this summer. The 35-year-old Chilean forward was at Inter last season but only on a one-year deal and is out of contract this summer after making 33 appearances in all competitions over the last campaign. It would take a significant pay-cut for the Barcelona man to join Como, but Fabregas will hope to tempt him in with regular game time late in his career. Former Liverpool stopper Karius has been at Newcastle since 2022 but has only made two appearances, leaving the club this month at the end of his contract at St James\u2019 Park. Alexis Sanchez is a free agent after leaving Inter (Picture: Getty Images) Karius is still just 30 years old but has not played regularly since the 2019-20 season when he was on loan at Besiktas from Liverpool. Since then he has been back-up at Union Berlin, back with the Reds and with the Magpies. The report from the Italian publication names a string of other targets, including: Mauro Icardi, Joaquin Correa, Andrea Pinamonti, Andrea Belotti Alessio Cragno, Stefano Sensi and Daniel Boloca.

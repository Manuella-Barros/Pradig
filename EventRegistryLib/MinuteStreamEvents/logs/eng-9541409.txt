The whale will then be buried on the beach.\n\nThey can only work as the tide allows, Rector said, because the area of the beach where the whale died, just north of the Indian River Inlet, is a very narrow stretch. It's in the area where the ocean breached the dunes during a storm a few months ago.\n\nThe whale was an emaciated sub-adult, MERR Director Suzanne Thurman said Sunday.\n\n\"This is a species that lives way off the coast, so they would never come in near shore, except when they get too weak to be able to surface to breathe and their instinct is to get out of the water,\" she said.\n\nThurman hoped to at least sedate the whale, she said, but the water level made it too dangerous.\n\n\"With the water going around her, she can roll on us and we would be killed,\" Thurman said.\n\nReports of the beached whale started coming in Sunday morning. MERR, a Lewes-based nonprofit, responded to the area and set up a perimeter. Hundreds of people came to the beach to see the ocean's second-largest whale.\n\nMany people even parked on the side of Coastal Highway and walked across the dunes to get a glimpse. The dunes serve not only as protection for the road but as a delicate ecosystem for wildlife.\n\n\"Delaware Natural Resources Police remind the public that crossing the dune to try and get a better view of the beached whale is prohibited and can result in a fine,\" department spokesman Michael Globetti said in a statement.\n\nHeading to the beach: Travel website's top 20 list includes 2 beach towns in or near Delaware. What earned nods?\n\nThe last whale to beach itself in Delaware was in 2021, when another fin whale beached died at Cape Henlopen State Park.

It thrashed its tail as people quietly urged it on, but made no progress.\n\nThe whale is a young fin whale, MERR Director Suzanne Thurman told the crowd. It's emaciated and has been sick for a long time, Thurman said, but there's no way of knowing what caused it to beach unless an autopsy can be performed.\n\n\"This is a species that lives way off the coast, so they would never come in near shore, except when they get too weak to be able to surface to breathe and their instinct is to get out of the water,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the whale's lungs were already being affected by its own body weight due to being out of the water, according to Thurman. She and her colleagues had hoped to at least sedate the whale.\n\n\"But it's too dangerous, with the water going around her, she can roll on us and we would be killed,\" Thurman said.\n\nThe 50-foot whale weighs 1 ton per foot, Thurman said.\n\n\"Unless she can reposition herself so we can safely get to her to try to sedate her, we're just gonna have to watch,\" she continued.\n\nShe warned it could be very hard for people to witness, especially children.\n\n\"We wish so much that we could do more for her,\" Thurman said. \"But she came in because she was dying.\"\n\nDelaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control representatives were on the scene, along with some heavy equipment, such as a backhoe. When another fin whale beached itself and died at the nearby Cape Henlopen State Park in 2022, it was buried there on the beach.\n\nFor the Delaware Seashore whale, however, there is no definite plan. The tide was coming in Sunday afternoon, and in the area where the whale beached, the water comes all the way up to the dunes.

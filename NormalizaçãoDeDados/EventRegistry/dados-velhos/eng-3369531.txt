Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience.\n\nRolling out a blueprint for 350-plus seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP president Amit Shah, sources said, told core members of the party that Mission 350-plus will have special focus on 150 seats in what the BJP calls its new catchment areas.\n\nAt the meeting chaired by Shah and attended by eight Union Ministers, a presentation was made, incorporating feedback and suggestions from state units to strengthen the party. These included inputs gathered during Shah's tour of states.\n\nThe BJP chief is learnt to have assigned a cluster of five Lok Sabha seats each to Union Ministers, leaders in the organisation and state ministers called to the meeting.\n\nShah is learnt to have told party leaders that the BJP will conduct frequent surveys -- once in three or four months -- to get a feel of the \"pulse from the ground\" and strategies will be altered accordingly.\n\nThere will be extra focus and thrust on 150 seats, mainly in states like West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala where the party is trying to emerge as a key electoral player.\n\nThe meeting, sources said, was attended by Union Ministers J P Nadda, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Piyush Goyal, Nirmala Sitharaman and Manoj Sinha. Also present were Uttar Pradesh minister Swatantra Dev Singh, BJP national secretary Mahendra Singh (Assam in-charge) and Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar.\n\nNadda and Sinha, sources said, have been assigned West Bengal, while Ravi Shankar Prasad has been assigned Lok Sabha seats in Assam. Likewise, Dharmendra Pradhan has been assigned seats in Kerala while Piyush Goyal will be looking after seats in Tamil Nadu and Nirmala Sitharaman in Karnataka.\n\n\"Senior ministers with broad organisation experience have been assigned these roles along with senior party office bearers and some state leaders,\" a BJP source said.\n\nThe ministers and leaders are expected to make regular visits to these Lok Sabha seats and coordinate with local units to prepare for the 2019 elections.\n\nLast September, a core committee meeting of the BJP had identified 115-120 seats from Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the North-East. Shah, who has been on a 95-day tour of the country to strategise on ways to secure a clear majority in 2019, is learnt to have identified 150 seats, where the party lost in 2014 but hopes to win next time.\n\nThe BJP has identified 600 full-time workers who will be deputed to Lok Sabha constituencies until the 2019 elections -- a full-time worker will be sent to monitor each Lok Sabha seat.\n\nThe BJP had assessed that it may just be difficult to hold on to the party's position in some states, especially in the Hindi heartland. The new blueprint focuses on 150 seats to compensate for possible losses elsewhere. In 2014, the BJP-led NDA had won 72 of 80 seats in UP, 42 of 48 in Maharashtra, 31 of 40 in Bihar, all 26 in Gujarat, all 25 in Rajasthan, 25 of 28 in Madhya Pradesh, and 7 of 10 in Haryana.", "date":

Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad, J.P. Nadda, Prakash Javadekar, Nirmala Sitharaman, Manoj Sinha and Narendra Singh Tomar. Apart from them, the meeting was also attended by all the eight General Secretaries and all the Co-General Secretaries (Organisation).\n\nDuring the meeting, Shah said the party's chances have increased not only in Odisha and West Bengal but also in Kerala.\n\n\"We have come to the second position in West Bengal and Odisha and our chances have brightened in Kerala,\" a leader who attended the meeting quoted Shah as saying.\n\nShah also asked the leaders to especially focus on those 150 seats where the BJP stood second or third in the last Lok Sabha polls. A presentation on the 150 seats was also given.\n\nIn the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP contested 428 seats and won 282 getting 31 per cent of vote share.\n\nThe BJP in 2014 had won 216 seats in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.\n\nThe party strategists feel that despite its attempts the BJP may not be able to win as many seats in 2019 as it won in these states in 2014. So it needs to focus in those areas where it could not perform well despite a wave in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nShah also asked the party leaders to aggressively counter the opposition onslaught on government schemes and policies.\n\n\"The Modi government has fulfilled the expectations of the people. Now, we need to implement the ambitious projects like Ujjwala and others of the government to ground level,\" Shah said according to the party leader.\n\nHe said the party has less than two years to work for the next Lok Sabha polls and special attention should be given so that the target can be achieved.\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

These included inputs gathered during Shah's tour of states.\n\nThe BJP chief is learnt to have assigned a cluster of five Lok Sabha seats each to Union Ministers, leaders in the organisation and state ministers called to the meeting.\n\nShah is learnt to have told party leaders that the BJP will conduct frequent surveys -- once in three or four months -- to get a feel of the \"pulse from the ground\" and strategies will be altered accordingly.\n\nThere will be extra focus and thrust on 150 seats, mainly in states like West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala where the party is trying to emerge as a key electoral player.\n\nThe meeting, sources said, was attended by Union Ministers J P Nadda, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Piyush Goyal, Nirmala Sitharaman and Manoj Sinha. Also present were Uttar Pradesh minister Swatantra Dev Singh, BJP national secretary Mahendra Singh (Assam in-charge) and Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar.\n\nNadda and Sinha, sources said, have been assigned West Bengal, while Ravi Shankar Prasad has been assigned Lok Sabha seats in Assam. Likewise, Dharmendra Pradhan has been assigned seats in Kerala while Piyush Goyal will be looking after seats in Tamil Nadu and Nirmala Sitharaman in Karnataka.\n\n\"Senior ministers with broad organisation experience have been assigned these roles along with senior party office bearers and some state leaders,\" a BJP source said.\n\nThe ministers and leaders are expected to make regular visits to these Lok Sabha seats and coordinate with local units to prepare for the 2019 elections.\n\nLast September, a core committee meeting of the BJP had identified 115-120 seats from Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the North-East. Shah, who has been on a 95-day tour of the country to strategise on ways to secure a clear majority in 2019, is learnt to have identified 150 seats, where the party lost in 2014 but hopes to win next time.\n\nThe BJP has identified 600 full-time workers who will be deputed to Lok Sabha constituencies until the 2019 elections -- a full-time worker will be sent to monitor each Lok Sabha seat.\n\nThe BJP had assessed that it may just be difficult to hold on to the party's position in some states, especially in the Hindi heartland. The new blueprint focuses on 150 seats to compensate for possible losses elsewhere. In 2014, the BJP-led NDA had won 72 of 80 seats in UP, 42 of 48 in Maharashtra, 31 of 40 in Bihar, all 26 in Gujarat, all 25 in Rajasthan, 25 of 28 in Madhya Pradesh, and 7 of 10 in Haryana.\n\nFor

Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Ravi Shankar Prasad, J.P. Nadda, Prakash Javadekar, Nirmala Sitharaman, Manoj Sinha and Narendra Singh Tomar. Apart from them, the meeting was also attended by all the eight General Secretaries and all the Co-General Secretaries (Organisation).\n\nDuring the meeting, Shah said the party's chances have increased not only in Odisha and West Bengal but also in Kerala.\n\n\"We have come to the second position in West Bengal and Odisha and our chances have brightened in Kerala,\" a leader who attended the meeting quoted Shah as saying.\n\nShah also asked the leaders to especially focus on those 150 seats where the BJP stood second or third in the last Lok Sabha polls. A presentation on the 150 seats was also given.\n\nIn the last Lok Sabha polls, the BJP contested 428 seats and won 282 getting 31 per cent of vote share.\n\nThe BJP in 2014 had won 216 seats in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar.\n\nThe party strategists feel that despite its attempts the BJP may not be able to win as many seats in 2019 as it won in these states in 2014. So it needs to focus in those areas where it could not perform well despite a wave in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nShah also asked the party leaders to aggressively counter the opposition onslaught on government schemes and policies.\n\n\"The Modi government has fulfilled the expectations of the people. Now, we need to implement the ambitious projects like Ujjwala and others of the government to ground level,\" Shah said according to the party leader.\n\nHe said the party has less than two years to work for the next Lok Sabha polls and special attention should be given so that the target can be achieved.\n\n--IANS\n\nbns/vsc/dg\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Most of them are in southern and north-eastern India.\n\nTheir job will be to oversee the BJP's preparedness and identify suitable candidates in these constituencies.\n\nSenior ministers of the Modi government will also be given the task of supervising five or six such Lok Sabha seats and convert them into BJP seats.\n\nWhile law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad will take charge of Assam, health minister JP Nadda and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan will oversee West Bengal and Kerala, respectively.\n\nPrabharis (in-charge) will be appointed for the 261 Lok Sabha seats where the party lost in 2014 elections. These prabharis will be party leaders from outside those constituencies. The BJP had won 282 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats in 2014 elections.\n\nShah briefed a select group of BJP leaders -- including nine Union ministers -- at the party headquarters about his blueprint for 2019, which turns focus on states such as West Bengal, Odisha, Kerala and the northeast. A 10-minute presentation on Shah's efforts to galvanize the party, BJP's current situation and its prospects in the polls was made to the BJP leaders at the meeting.\n\nThe BJP had won all the Lok Sabha seats from Rajasthan and Gujarat last time, and is near its peak in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. Soures told HT that Shah told party leaders to look for greener pastures to compensate any loss in these areas.\n\nThe BJP has high hopes from Odisha, where it could win just one of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, and West Bengal, which accounts for 42 parliamentary segments, of which two are with the BJP.\n\nShah told BJP leaders that Modi's personal popularity has grown over the last three years, but the party cannot afford any laxity. He asked the party leaders to ensure anti-incumbency does not set in, and suggested that the organisation work closely with the local bodies to address grievance at the lowest level. \"All surveys show BJP winning more than 300 seats if elections were held today,\" said a BJP leader who attended the meeting.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51434"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of R\u0101jasth\u0101n"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of R\u0101jasth\u0101n"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52279"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53284"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53687"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Gujar\u0101t"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Gujar\u0101t"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54309"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55499"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Chhatt\u012bsgarh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Chhatt\u012bsgarh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58379"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Jharkhand"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Jharkhand"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58380"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304063", "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "312205", "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323194"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_Prasad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "327729", "label": {"eng": "Ravi Shankar Prasad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "337147", "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmendra_Pradhan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "350094", "label": {"eng": "Dharmendra Pradhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "359469", "label": {"eng": "Northeast India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagat_Prakash_Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1278300", "label": {"eng": "Jagat Prakash Nadda"}}]}

Apart from it, Shah also stressed on winning 150 seats in areas in which BJP wants to make inroads, the report says. Shah said this during a meeting with eight Union Ministers. It has been learnt that a detailed presentation was made and inputs from state units were considered to strengthen the party. Shah has toured states like Kerala, Karnataka in recent times and is scheduled to visit Madhya Pradesh today. The state visits assume significance given that Shah holds extensive meeting with office bearers.\n\nAccording to Indian Express report, Shah had assigned a cluster of five Lok Sabha seats each to Union Ministers, leaders in the organisation and state ministers called to the meeting. Regarding winning that 150 seats, BJP is focussing on states like West Bengal, Assam, Odisha, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. As part of its strategy, BJP will conduct frequent surveys -- once in three or four months -- to comprehend the pulse from the ground zero. Shah also emphasized on adopting flexible strategies which means surveys will play a pivotal role in changing strategies as per the need.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Union Ministers J P Nadda, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Prakash Javadekar, Ananth Kumar, Dharmendra Pradhan, Piyush Goyal, Nirmala Sitharaman and Manoj Sinha. Also present were Uttar Pradesh minister Swatantra Dev Singh, BJP national secretary Mahendra Singh (Assam in-charge) and Mumbai BJP chief Ashish Shelar.

The new 'Mission 350+' is to focus on 150 seats where the BJP was number two or three in 2014. The 31 leaders were asked to focus on five seats each from this list, for the next two years.\n\nCabinet ministers who attended were Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal, Nirmala Sitharaman, Arjun Meghwal, Ananth Kumar, Jagdish Nadda, Prakash Javadekar, Manoj Sinha, Narendra Tomar and Dharmendra Pradhan.\n\nSenior party functionaries also attended the nearly three-hour meet.

Analysis of states where the BJP had performed poorly in 2014, especially West Bengal and Odisha, was also presented.\n\nShah briefed the leaders on his recent visits to several states. The analysis on Bengal was tempered with the news that the Trinamool Congress had swept municipal polls, winning all seven civic bodies at stake in the voting last Sunday. The BJP was, however, second in most places, with Left parties relegated to third position. The Congress failed to win a single seat.\n\nAn India Today opinion poll predicts that if the Lok Sabha election were to take place now, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would win; the results also came on Thursday. It gives the NDA as many as 349 seats, with the BJP winning 298. The Congress-led UPA is given 75, with the Congress tally at 47. Other parties get 119 seats.\n\nIn Mumbai, state Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis sought to dispel speculation on his shifting to Delhi. \"There is no possibility as of now of my shifting to the Centre,\" he said, adding he'd continue as CM \"till Delhi calls\".\n\nHowever, some of the present Union ministers could find themselves dropped.

The target is to nurture them over the next one and a half year and convert them into a BJP bastion. \"Even if we can win half of these 120 seats, we will touch 350 figure,\" a union minister who attended the Thursday meeting told HT.\n\nNarendra Modi: The prime minister continues to be the BJP's most popular leader, and Shah is confident there is no dip in Modi's personal appeal. Several surveys conducted by Shah have shown that Modi's popularity has increased since 2014 and he continues to be several miles ahead of his nearest rivals. With no clarity about opposition's prime ministerial candidate, who will take on Modi in 2019, the BJP is confident it will have an advantage in the next election.\n\nRead more:Three years of Modi govt: How the PM has transformed the political landscape, writes Swapan Dasgupta\n\nPro-poor policies: The BJP is pinning its hopes on several populist schemes, such as free LPG connection for BPL families, to do wonders in the next election. Shah believes it was the effective rollout of these schemes that helped the party win states such as Uttar Pradesh with a three fourths majority. The BJP has managed to shed its pro-rich and pro-corporate image, something which even prompted Congress' Rahul Gandhi to take 'suit boot ki Sarkar' jibe at Modi in the past.\n\nCongress : The Congress continues to be the main rivals of the BJP, nationally. Shah has told BJP leaders that any anti-Modi formulation will not survive without the support of the grand old party. But it is feeding grounds to the BJP. The Congress has lost a series of election, Punjab being an exception, and there is no immediate relief in the sight. The BJP is confident of winning Himachal Pradesh later this year and Karnataka next year. Both are currently ruled by the Congress. With Congress weakening in the states, Shah is hopeful it will not be able to survive BJP onslaught in the next election.\n\nRead more: Congress needs a new slogan and India needs a new opposition, writes Barkha Dutt\n\nNew areas: Shah is excited with the response BJP is getting in states such as Odisha, West Bengal, Kerala and the northeast. The BJP has its government is Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and six Trinamool Congress MLAs have merged with BJP in Tripura. It has won an assembly seat for the first time in Kerala and done well in the panchayat election in Odisha, replacing Congress as the principal opposition to ruling Biju Janta Dal. Odisha and Bengal alone account for 63 Lok Sabha seats. The BJP expects to increase its tally in these states.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Uttar Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51434"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Manipur"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Manipur"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53127"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53687"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Karn\u0101taka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Karn\u0101taka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53749"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Him\u0101chal Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Him\u0101chal Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54179"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55499"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Arun\u0101chal Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Arun\u0101chal Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55519"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "308732", "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "312205", "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "314477", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "321828", "label": {"eng": "All India Trinamool Congress"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323194"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323657", "label": {"eng": "Bengal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "324350", "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "331972", "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "337147", "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swapan_Dasgupta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "388715", "label": {"eng": "Swapan Dasgupta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkha_Dutt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "703806", "label": {"eng": "Barkha Dutt"}}]}

However, in keeping with the manner in which Amit Shah likes to work, the target has been stretched to attempt 350 seats.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Tamil N\u0101du"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51648"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53687"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Assam"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55499"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "312205", "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_Prasad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "327729", "label": {"eng": "Ravi Shankar Prasad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitaraman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "331548", "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "337147", "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoj_Sinha", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "367613", "label": {"eng": "Manoj Sinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "612395", "label": {"eng": "13th Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagat_Prakash_Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1278300", "label": {"eng": "Jagat Prakash Nadda"}}]}

It bagged 10 more than the required number for a majority in the 543-member House.\n\nShah was the party in-charge of Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP won an unprecedented 71 out of 80 seats in the last general polls.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of West Bengal"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51299"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Madhya Pradesh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53284"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Kerala"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53687"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Karn\u0101taka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of Karn\u0101taka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "53749"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Gujar\u0101t"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of Gujar\u0101t"}, "type": "loc", "id": "54309"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of Chhatt\u012bsgarh"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of Chhatt\u012bsgarh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "58379"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304333", "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "314477", "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Trinamool_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321828", "label": {"eng": "All India Trinamool Congress"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "type": "loc", "id": "323194"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "324350", "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_Prasad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "327729", "label": {"eng": "Ravi Shankar Prasad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitaraman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331548", "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "337147", "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "340150", "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chief_Ministers_of_West_Bengal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "340152", "label": {"eng": "List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_general_election,_2009", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "360051", "label": {"eng": "Indian general election, 2009"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagat_Prakash_Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1278300", "label": {"eng": "Jagat Prakash Nadda"}}]}

Though there is over a year to go for the next Lok Sabha elections, Mr Shah wants the BJP organisation, including state units, to be battle ready for various state and local body elections whose result will also have an impact on the 2019 electoral battle.\n\nThe Central ministers at the meeting included Ravi Shankar Prasad, Piyush Goyal, Narendra Singh Tomar, J.P. Nadda, Dharmendra Pradhan, Nirmala Sitharaman and Manoj Sinha. The national general secretaries, including Murlidhar Rao, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Anil Jain and Ram Madhav, and joint general secretaries Saudan Singh, V. Satish, Shivprakash and B.L. Santosh also attended the meeting, that lasted nearly two hours at the party's 11 Ashoka Road headquarters here. The BJP leaders, sources said, also discussed socio-economic issues and caste-wise distribution of voters in various states.\n\nAs part of Mr Shah's election blueprint, the leadership has been assessing the \"actual\" organisational strength in all states, including BJP-ruled states. Mr Shah, who has been personally visiting state units for a \"reality check\" of the party's strength, has assigned the national general secretaries and organisational secretaries to get feedback on various issues. Also, Central ministers and the general secretaries were given charge of parliamentary seats in which the party had either lost or had done poorly.\n\nMr Shah, it is learnt, discussed the feedback from states and reviewed the implementation and impact of Central government schemes. Sources said he also deliberated with senior party leaders on the issues that have been troubling the state units and also the BJP-ruled states.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 273, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "52726"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "306107", "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piyush_Goyal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "308731", "label": {"eng": "Piyush Goyal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309647", "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312205", "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Shankar_Prasad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "327729", "label": {"eng": "Ravi Shankar Prasad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmala_Sitaraman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331548", "label": {"eng": "Nirmala Sitharaman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "337147", "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmendra_Pradhan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "350094", "label": {"eng": "Dharmendra Pradhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoj_Sinha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "367613", "label": {"eng": "Manoj Sinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Singh_Tomar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "472182", "label": {"eng": "Narendra Singh Tomar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Madhav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "498901", "label": {"eng": "Ram Madhav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil_Jain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1276249", "label": {"eng": "Anil Jain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kailash_Vijayvargiya", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1340021", "label": {"eng": "Kailash Vijayvargiya"}}]}

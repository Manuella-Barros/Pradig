This is a victory lap and a victory tour for Vasiliy.\n\n\"I don't see Kambosos becoming this action-packed star he was three years ago when he beat Teofimo Lopez.\n\n\"This is simply Loma's victory lap and we will all salute him and not expect too much from Kambosos.\n\n\"In terms of styles, this is not a fight that is built for him (Kambosos) to dazzle the crowd.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to this battle for the IBF lightweight world title, Kambosos has waged a social-media war of words with former American welterweight Paul Malignaggi, who says Lomachenko will bury the 30-year-old Sydneysider.\n\n\"I don't think I have ever seen anyone maximise one win so well,\" said Malignaggi, referencing Kambosos' epic boilover of Lopez in November 2021, before he lost his titles to Devin Haney.\n\n\"Kambosos pulled off a big upset, it was a special night for him and he will always have that win.\n\n\"But George barely won a round against Haney in two fights and then the fight against Maxi Hughes (last year), he won a handful of rounds and somehow got the decision.\n\n\"I am happy that Kambosos is setting up his retirement, but I think he barely wins a round in this fight against Lomachenko and I feel like he should retire after this fight.\"\n\nKambosos (21-2, 10KO) has never been stopped in his 23-fight career and has a height and reach advantage over Lomachenko, who started his career at featherweight.\n\n\"Our careers are on the line here,\" he said. \"I believe I have the style to beat Lomachenko. There will be no stepping back.\n\n\"When I beat Lomachenko, there'll be no more roads for him to go. This is retirement for him.\n\n\"The way I'm sparring, the way I'm firing on every engine.

Legacy is on the line and the way this has happened for me, it's destiny.\"\n\nOf their marathon stare-down, Kambosos detected weakness, saying: \"I could see he was starting to move, the face was starting to move around. He was having those thoughts: 'I don't want to do this all day, I want to go back to my room in the hotel.'\"\n\nBut Lomachenko, a dual Olympic gold medallist who won world titles in three different weight classes after just 12 fights, was bored by what he saw as cheap talk from Kambosos.\n\n\"This wasn't the first time that I've stayed too long on the face-off.

The event will be shown at 10:00 p.m. ET 7:00 p.m. PT.\n\nKambosos, 30, hasn't said if he'll retire if he loses to Lomachenko, but it's unlikely that he will. The Aussie is getting too much money, milking his one big career win over Teofimo Lopez, for all it's worth, even while his career has been in a free fall ever since.\n\nKambosos can continue to rake in the dough fighting in Australia after a loss to Lomachenko, but obviously, there will come a point where the money will dry up. 'Ferocious' Kambosos is too rich to fight for chicken feed, and he'll then hang up his gloves.

Me beating him does retire him. That's just stating the facts, but you can't fault the guy,\" said George Kambosos Jr. to the Top Rank Boxing YouTube channel, talking about his fight against Vasily Lomachenko on Saturday night.\n\nIt doesn't look good for Kambosos in this match-up, as he's facing a guy that is world's better than him talent-wise in Lomachenko.\n\nAlthough Loma is getting up there in age at 36 and fighting two divisions above his best weight class of 126, he's on another level than Kambosos, who is a basic fringe-level fighter, who got lucky with a win over distracted, ring-rusty, injured Teofimo Lopez in 2020.\n\nNothing has gone right for Kambosos since that fight, unless you count his questionable win over Maxi Hughes last July in which he was given a gift in a fight that he appeared to lose.\n\n\"But with respect, on Sunday, I've got a job to do and respect goes out the window.

Odds are subject to change.\n\nGeorge Kambosos Jr enters this fight with the geographical advantage as he is originally from Australia. Standing 5-foot-9 with a 68-inch reach, Kambosos Jr has fought 23 professional fights with a 21-2 record in these matches.\n\nHe has secured a knockout in 10 of his 21 victories. Fighting out of the orthodox stance, Kambosos Jr also enters as the younger fighter at age 30. He is currently ranked 2nd in the 135-pound division by the IBF and 7th by the RING. Kambosos Jr most recently fought on July 22nd, 2023.\n\nThis was a victory by majority decision over Maxi Hughes. Before this, he lost to Devin Haney by unanimous decision which also was fought in Australia. Kambosos Jr has fought five times since October 2020, securing victories in three of these five fights with each of them coming down to decision.\n\nVasiliy Lomachenko enters this fight with a 17-3 career record with 11 of these victories coming via knockout. He stands 5-foot-7 with a 65.5-inch reach. At 36 years old, Lomachenko is the older fighter although they have relatively similar professional experience.\n\nIt is worth noting that Lomachenko is believed to have extensive amateur experience as Bob Arum, the CEO of Top Rank, claims he had 397 amateur fights and only lost one.\n\nFighting out of the southpaw stance, he also is expected to have the power advantage with his 65% knockout rate outperforming the 48% that Kambosos Jr has produced.\n\nLomachenko enters this fight ranked 3rd by the IBF and 1st by RING in the lightweight division. His last fight was also a loss to Devin Haney on May 20th, 2023 via unanimous decision.\n\nPrior to that, he had defeated Jamaine Ortuze and Richard Commey each by decision. He has won three of his last five fights and also has fought five times since October 2020.\n\nThe George Kambosos Jr vs Vasiliy Lomachenko fight is available on most legal sportsbooks.

It also is a bit of a surprise for Vasility Lomachenko to be as significant of a favorite as he is considering their pair of resumes, but the style of the fighters is worth noting.\n\nGeorge Kambosos Jr has the height and reach advantage in this fight. However, his biggest challenge will be avoiding a power punch from the left hand of Lomachenko.\n\nKamobosos Jr is a smart fighter who is effective when dictating the pace of the fight. He is capable of taking a punch but will be sure to be focused on not allowing Lomachenko to unleash a flurry of attacks.\n\nWhile he officially won his most recent fight, Kambosos Jr very easily could be on a three-fight losing skid. It was a controversial ending against Maxi Hughes in which Kambosos Jr officially won by majority decision with some viewing this result differently.\n\nHe also lost to Devin Haney in back-to-back fights before this. The result against Hughes is especially interesting as, just like Lomachenko, he fights out of a southpaw stance.\n\nLomachenko is a far more polished fighter that can induce far more damage. If Kambosos Jr has the same game plan against Lomachenko that he had against Hughes, he will not last 12 rounds.\n\nThis is dangerous as Lomachenko should have the inside track on winning on the scorecard which should push Kambosos to be in attack mode.\n\nIn addition to his power, the footwork and movement of Vasiliy Lomachenko are what make him so impressive as a boxer. Based out of the southpaw stance, he is effective at controlling the pace of the fight as well which will be interesting to watch throughout the fight.\n\nThis battle over who is in control will play a large role in who is crowned the victor.\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist also is in tremendous shape and has shown that he does not wear down as the fight goes deeper.\n\nThe Ukrainian is coming off being on the other end of a controversial decision. Despite losing to Devin Haney by unanimous decision in his most recent fight, many boxing pundits believed this should have gone to Lomachenko.\n\nAt the minimum, the fight was far closer than the scorecards indicated. Lomachenko was on a three-fight winning streak and had one 16 of his previous 17 fights before this.\n\nHe will be looking to get back on the right track and make a statement with a strong performance in his fight.\n\nThis should be a closer fight than the massive odds differences indicate. George Kambosos Jr is a fair opponent in this fight, but this is an incredibly difficult matchup for him.\n\nExpect him to struggle to be able to control the tempo and for Lomachenko to be one step ahead of his combos.\n\nIt is concerning how much Kambosos Jr struggled with Maxi Hughes as Lomachenko is a more polished southpaw fighter with some similar characteristics.\n\nAlso, with disappointing results in the Devin Haney fight still on his mind, expect Lomachenko to attempt to find a window to end this fight early and avoid a decision if possible.\n\nBookmakers clearly expect this fight to go the distance. Currently, you can bet on Lomachenko to win by decision at -175 odds, for the fight to go over 10.5 rounds at -370, or for the fight to go the distance at -275.\n\nThis opens the door for there to be value in betting for this not to be the case.\n\nExpect Lomachenko to be more willing to take risks than is often the case with significant favorites. George Kambosos Jr will struggle to control the tempo of the fight and Lomachenko is capable of punishing him if he leaves himself exposed.\n\nExpect Kambosos Jr to attempt to take control early and for Lomachenko to weather the storm.\n\nAs the middle rounds of the fight continue on, it takes just one opportunity for Lomachenko to capitalize and he possesses the knockout power to finish the fight right there.\n\nExpect this to be a lengthy fight but for Lomachenko to find a way to end it early in the later rounds.\n\nHe will not make the mistake of leaving it up to the judges to decide by putting forth a convincing finish in this one.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nor will it be about the monster incoming pay day from what he dubs \"Australia's greatest ever fight\". Instead, Kambosos is focusing on one thing and one thing only: his legacy.\n\nHow he is perceived as a fighter, both now and once he has hung up the gloves, is something Kambosos (21-2, 10 KOs) has been fixated on ever since this mega bout with Lomachenko (17-3, 11 KOs) was officially announced in January. Each media appearance in the build-up has offered Kambosos an opportunity to elaborate on how significant a win over the two-time Olympic gold medalist and three-division champion would be, and how it would impact the mark he leaves on the sport.\n\n\"For me, this is about legacy. Nothing else,\" a defiant Kambosos said earlier in the year. \"He has made money, I have made money. He has won belts, I have won belts. I've been in the big fights [and] fought the best. I've won the big fights, lost the big fights. But this here is legacy; destiny for both guys. We don't need to go overboard or create any storylines or headlines. This is two warriors coming together to fight.\"\n\nThe legacy Kambosos is referring to, and seeking, is a place in the coveted International Boxing Hall of Fame, an honour that's only been bestowed on five Australians -- Jeff Fenech, Kostya Tszyu, Peter Jackson, Young Griffo, and Les Darcy.\n\nKambosos and his camp are convinced a win over pound-for-pound great Lomachenko, albeit at 36 years of age and firmly in the twilight of his career, will bolster his resume to a point where entry into the ultra-exclusive fight club becomes undeniable.\n\n\"This fight cements me in the Hall of Fame, I truly believe it. They can't deny that,\" said Kambosos. \"What I have been able to achieve, the fighters I've been able to fight, the events I've been able to bring to Australia ... how can they deny Kambosos' resume?\"\n\nThe problem with legacy is that it doesn't solely trend in the positive direction. And while flowers will rightly be thrown at the feet of Kambosos if he's able to upset Lomachenko, a loss would only feed the one-fight-wonder narrative many have formed over what's been a rather underwhelming past 24 months.\n\nKambosos shot to fame in November of 2021 when he caused not only ESPN's 2021 Upset of the Year, but one of boxing's biggest boilovers of the 21st century. The unheralded Sydneysider travelled to New York and handed unified American star Teofimo Lopez his first -- and still only -- loss, by way of split decision. It was a fight that won Kambosos a swag of lightweight championship belts, and provided a launchpad for his international boxing career.\n\nBut two-and-a-half years on, that night is beginning to appear more anomaly than the standard.\n\nKambosos lost the belts six months later following a one-sided loss -- scored 116-112, 116-112, 118-110 -- to Devin Haney in Melbourne. His rematch with the unbeaten American four months later was even more lopsided, Haney once again humiliating the former titlist in his home country, 119-109, 118-110, 118-110.\n\nKambosos would make his return to the ring in mid-2023 when he faced Maxi Hughes, a bout that ended in highly controversial fashion. The Englishman produced a career-best performance, outlanded Kambosos and left him bloody and bruised, yet it was the Australian getting the nod 114-114, 117-111, 115-113, as a chorus of boos rung out around Firelake Arena in Oklahoma.\n\nControversy aside, the win breathed life back into Kambosos' career. Cue Lomachenko.\n\nKambosos and Lomachenko, a former long-time unified lightweight champion, had been slated to fight for undisputed honours in the Australian summer of 2022. However, those plans were scuppered when Lomachenko opted to return to his family during the war in Ukraine, opening the door for Haney to step in and fight Kambosos. While the bout between Lomachenko and Kambosos did not go ahead, it remained firmly on the boxing radar, ultimately being agreed upon as the headline act of a blockbuster bill in the Australian city of Perth.\n\nThe resumes of Kambosos and Lomachenko might be poles apart, but the two fighters do share one commonality: losses to Haney. But unlike Kambosos, who was totally outclassed on two occasions, many felt Lomachenko did enough to get the judges' nod when he and Haney fought in May last year. It was the last time we saw Lomachenko in the ring, and it was a performance that certainly proved he still has plenty left in the tank.\n\nFor that reason, plus the increasing likelihood of a Lomachenko-Shakur Stevenson mega clash if the Ukrainian is able to salute, Kambosos has been installed by bookmakers as a 7-1 underdog per ESPN BET in Sunday's fight. And just as it was when Kambosos battled Lopez at Madison Square Garden in 2021, few are making a case the Australian can cause the upset. He's not bothered by it, though. In fact, Kambosos is relishing his underdog status and has plans to retire his highly credentialed opponent.\n\n\"When I beat Lomachenko, there'll be no more road for him to go,\" said Kambosos at Thursday afternoon's official press conference in Perth, one which featured a three-minute stare-down between the two fighters. \"This is retirement for him, I truly believe it.\n\n\"The way I'm sparring, the way I'm firing on every engine. The speed that I have ... he's never seen this kind of speed and explosive power. The will, the heart I have, the desire to win this fight. I want this bad. I've prepared extremely hard for this fight. I've left no stone unturned.\"\n\nKambosos knows full well that a high-profile fight against Lomachenko provides an opportunity to regenerate his boxing career and re-establish himself as one of the division's top fighters. But a third loss in four fights would be a career hammer blow, one that would have him plummeting down the lightweight rankings and almost certainly waving goodbye to any future world title battles.\n\n\"[After this fight] only one of us will continue with their career,\" said Kambosos. \"One of us will go not where we want to go. So, I'm very motivated. I know he's motivated.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type":

In recent years, the Ukrainian lefty's star has dimmed due to points defeats at the hands of Teofimo Lopez and Devin Haney. However, many insiders believe Loma deserved the decision against Haney and his performance was excellent.\n\nWATCH: Lomachenko vs. Kambosos, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nKambosos (21-2, 10 KOs) is the former unified lightweight champ. The Australian brawler dropped and outpointed Lopez to win the IBF, WBA, WBO and Ring championships in 2021. However, in back-to-back undisputed title fights with Haney, Kambosos lost both via wide unanimous decision. He was also unconvincing against British fighter Maxi Hughes in his most recent decision win.\n\nThe Sporting News provides odds and a final prediction for this big world title bout in Australia.\n\nPer BetMGM, Lomachenko is the -650 favorite while Kambosos is the +450 underdog.\n\nThis looks like an awful style confrontation for Kambosos.\n\nIn his most recent outing against Maxi Hughes, the Australian brawler was largely ineffectual. The ex-champ escaped with a majority decision win, but that could easily have been his third straight loss following back-to-back defeats at the hands of Devin Haney.\n\nThe reason why the Hughes performance is a worry for Team Kambosos is because they were up against a mobile lefty with quick hands and quick feet. That is exactly what Lomachenko is, but the Ukrainian wizard is on a completely different level and carries a multitude of added extras.\n\nYou get the best out of Kambosos if you engage him in a firefight. While his world title-winning performance was awe-inspiring, Teofimo Lopez made so many mistakes against him. Underestimated, Kambosos brought \"The Takeover\" back down to earth with a smart and aggressive display.\n\nBut against boxers with a reliance on being defensive, Kambosos hasn't been anywhere near as successful. Naturally smaller fighters Mickey Bey and Lee Selby pushed him before dropping close split decisions, Haney had a field day across 24 rounds, and Hughes suffered a controversial points loss.\n\nUnless Loma has fallen off a cliff as a fighter, the smart money says he wins this fight by wide unanimous decision. That's the official pick because Kambosos is a blood and guts warrior and he'll be hard to shift.

Their 12-round boxing main event tops the Lomachenko vs. Kambosos fight card (8 p.m. ET) from RAC Arena in Perth, Australia. The title is vacant because it was left behind by former unified lightweight champion Devin Haney, who discarded all four major belts before moving up to junior welterweight. Coincidentally, Lomachenko hasn't fought since dropping a disputed decision last May against Haney for the unified lightweight title that Haney won by defeating Kambosos. Kambosos is coming off a majority decision victory against Maxi Hughes last July.\n\nLomachenko is a -650 favorite (risk $650 to win $100), while Kambosos is priced at +450 in the latest Vasiliy Lomachenko vs. George Kambosos Jr. odds. The over/under for total rounds is 10.5, with the Over shaded to -310. Before locking in any George Kombosos Jr. vs. Vasiliy Lomachenko picks, make sure you see the boxing predictions and betting advice from SportsLine expert Brandon Wise.\n\nWise, who is the combat sports editor for CBS Sports, is an experienced boxing and mixed martial arts analyst who has consistently provided winning selections for SportsLine members. For the past four years, he has hit numerous boxing selections in big-time matchups.\n\nFor example, in March, Wise called a win in Round 1 for Jake Paul (+200) against Ryan Bourland and also advised SportsLine members to take the Under 1.5 rounds (+120). Both bets connected when Paul scored a knockout toward the end of the first round. Anyone who has followed Wise's combat sports picks has already seen massive returns.\n\nNow, with Vasiliy Lomachenko vs. George Kambosos Jr. on deck, Wise has studied the matchup from every angle and released confident picks for the fight. You can only see those picks at SportsLine.\n\nVasiliy Lomachenko vs. George Kambosos Jr. preview\n\nLomachenko (17-3) is a two-time Olympic gold medalist who is widely considered one of the most prolific amateur boxers in the history of the sport. The 36-year-old Ukrainian has since gone on to become one of the top professional boxers of this generation. In a rarity for boxing, and on the strength of his colossal amateur career, Lomachenko was fast-tracked to a title fight in just his second appearance as a pro and won the vacant WBO featherweight title in his third pro fight with a majority decision over Gary Russell Jr. in June 2014.\n\nIn just his 12th professional fight, Lomachenko won a title in a third weight class, but he became something of a polarizing star for the sport. Although he had become one of boxing's dominant champions, it often appeared as though he purposely exhibited a risk-averse style that involved him doing the minimum necessary to defeat overmatched opponents.\n\nHis shield of invincibility was shattered when Teofimo Lopez took Lomachenko's two major lightweight belts with a dominant unanimous decision in October 2020. However, in just his first defense, Lopez was defeated by Kambosos, an upset that many considered an even bigger one than Lopez over Lomachenko.\n\nKambosos (21-2) is a straight-ahead brawler who is known for maximizing his somewhat limited natural talent with grit and determination, along with a touch of good fortune. To illustrate the latter, his upset of Lopez was his third consecutive split-decision victory.\n\nKambosos saw his first defense result in a lopsided decision loss to Haney in June 2022, and a contracted rematch four months later netted the same outcome. Haney proceeded to take a razor-thin decision in May of last year against Lomachenko, though many observers believed the Ukrainian deserved to get his hand raised.

Yeah,\" Lomachenko promoter Bob Arum told BoxingScene. \"He's 36 and not that old but he had a long 400-fight amateur career at the top level. He's probably not as good as he was five years ago. George Kambosos is a live dog in the fight. He's a very good fighter and always in shape. It's going to be a tough fight. I love having Loma as part of Top Rank and have great affection for him. He's a tremendous man. Everything you want from a fighter.\n\n\"But he's in very tough against Kambosos. That's going to be a very interesting match that I'm looking forward to. I believe Lomachenko is still a great fighter. I thought Loma won the Haney fight. But again, judges decided otherwise, and you have to respect the decision of the judges.\"\n\nKambosos told BoxingScene that he respects Lomachenko but doesn't think he has the \"dog in him\" anymore.\n\nLomachenko has had a dominant run at 130 pounds but comparatively mixed results at 135, a division he's always deemed too big for his diminutive frame.\n\nIf Lomachenko turns back the clock and scores a statement win against Kambosos, Arum said a possible title unification fight could be explored with Top Rank stablemate Shakur Stevenson.\n\nThe WBC lightweight champion Stevenson is a pending free agent following his July 6 title defense against Artem Harutyunyan but has long expressed interest in fighting Lomachenko.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teofimo_Lopez", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teofimo Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masayoshi_Nakatani", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masayoshi Nakatani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Commey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Commey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaine_Ortiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaine Ortiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Haney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Haney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Arum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Arum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakur_Stevenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shakur Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/vasiliy-lomachenko%20(2)_1684544047.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554039", "eventUri": "eng-9554039", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 1174, "textEnd": 1180}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1182, "textEnd": 1188}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 2528, "textEnd": 2534}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The legendary Australian spoke about his fellow countryman's previous win over Max Hughes, which some, including Fenech, felt Kambosos lost.\n\nKambosos was awarded the win via majority decision, which Fenech claimed was undeserved, while characterizing Hughes as a subpar boxer. According to Fenech, Kambosos will likely lose to Lomachenko if he fights the Ukranian phenom the same way he did Hughes.\n\nThis is what he had to say an interview with Wide World of Sports, where he lambasted Kambosos' performance against Hughes:\n\n\"But if George thought he beat that guy [Matt Hughes] in his last fight... these days if you get punched in the head 50,000 times, and you know you lost but you still put your hand up in the air as if you won the fight. It's embarrassing.\"\n\nNevertheless, Kambosos captured the IBO lightweight title with his win over Hughes. However, some believe that Kambosos' status as a champion is questionable, as his performance was anything but convincing. Meanwhile, Lomachenko is often lauded for his impressive performances in the ring.\n\nWidely hailed as one of the greatest boxers of the modern age, the Ukranian phenom was once regarded as a pound-for-pound great and in the eyes of many, still is.

He won a world title in just his third pro fight, added a second division title by his seventh fight and then authored an incredible four-fight stretch (ending in 2017) where his opponents all quit on their stool (briefly labeling him as \"No-mas-chenko\" by adoring fans and media).\n\nThe only problem for Lomachenko was that he became so dominant at 126 and 130 pounds that the other champions refused to fight him, which derailed his dream of becoming a four-belt, undisputed champion. That's the reason why Lomachenko moved up so quickly to lightweight in just his 12th fight, in a weight class admittedly over his head in terms of size and effectiveness of his power.\n\nLomachenko is so great, however, that it barely seemed to matter. He secured almost unanimous approval as pound-for-pound king yet went on to see his dream of collecting all four titles come up short twice -- both times in disputed decisions against unbeaten champions (Teofimo Lopez Jr., Devin Haney) who looked poised to use the breakthrough victory to become household names.\n\nThe biggest difference between then and now is that the two men who barely defeated Lomachenko at lightweight have now come and gone after physically outgrowing the division. But the diminutive Lomachenko is still here and his desire at age 36 to achieve his dream, just as his window of opportunity appears to slowly be closing, couldn't be stronger.\n\nLomachenko returns on Saturday, in Perth, Australia, when he challenges native hero George Kambosos Jr. (21-2, 10 KOs) for the IBF title that was vacated when Haney moved up to 140 pounds last fall. The fight has been titled \"Road to Redemption,\" which is not only aimed at Lomachenko but the fact that Kambosos, the division's former unified king following his 2021 upset of Lopez, dropped a pair of title losses to Haney the following year.\n\n\"I was a man who wanted to take the world,\" Lomacheko said during Top Rank's pre-fight documentary series. \"I was very close with undisputed but I can't because I lose in the lightweight and [the loss] took my dream, took my goal. I wouldn't like to finish on that note.\"\n\nLomachenko's 2020 loss to Lopez was much closer than the scorecards intimated, as the shifty southpaw furiously rallied over the second half but came up short (and, admittedly, started too late). But it was the fight last May for Haney's undisputed title that saw the majority of observers believe Lomachenko had done enough and that age had yet to rob him of his superiority.\n\n\"I had a chance [against Haney], I lose this chance,\" Lomachenko said. \"On the paper, I am not an undisputed world champion but, inside, if we talk with Teofimo, it was close. But if we are talking with Haney, it was not a close fight. I understand that I won this fight. People know and understand about this robbery.\"\n\nNot only does this weekend's fight, which will air live on Sunday in Australia, present Lomachenko with an opportunity to get back into the title mix should he capture the IBF crown, it would put him on the fast track -- according to Hall-of-Fame promoter Bob Arum -- to getting a final shot at his undisputed dreams in the near future.\n\nArum, the CEO and founder of Top Rank, told Sky Sports this week that a Lomachenko victory could propel him into an immediate title unification bout with unbeaten, WBC champion Shakur Stevenson, whose recent run as a three-division champion allowed him to pass Lomachenko into the top10 of the P4P.\n\nTwo major hurdles -- aside from the fact that Lomachenko, a 7-to-1 betting favorite, must first conquer the upset-minded Kambosos -- remain surrounding Stevenson, however. He must first defend his WBC title on July 6 against Artem Harutyunyan (12-1, 7 KOs) and then must decide, at the conclusion of his Top Rank deal, whether to re-sign with the promotion or seek bigger offers elsewhere (including PBC, where star WBA champion Gervonta Davis resides).\n\n\"So, if Lomachenko wins, and Shakur wins, then for the fall [we] do a Lomachenko-Shakur fight,\" Arum said. \"Every serious boxing fan will be watching that in awe, between two great technicians fighting for a unified title. Let's see what happens. Kambosos is very good. Even though he doesn't come from Perth, he's fighting on home territory, which means something.\"\n\nTo Lomachenko's credit, even though his undisputed dream has been talked about for years, he refuses to look past the challenge ahead of him before lining up potential fights with any of the other champions, whether it be Stevenson, Davis or whomever ends up claiming the still-vacant WBO strap.\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to the IBF title,\" Lomachenko said at Wednesday's final press conference. \"I need to take my title, and then after that, I can think about my future.\"\n\nOf Lomachenko's 20 pro fights, an incredible 16 have been contested for at least one recognized world title. This was the same boxer who only signed with Arum under the promise he would have a shot at competing for a championship in his pro debut (he was ultimately forced to wait for his second pro fight, which he lost by disputed decision).\n\nSo, when Lomachenko thinks about the last remaining goal on his boxing to-do list, it becomes easy to understand why the idea of an undisputed championship gives him so much motivation and pride.\n\n\"In the professional boxing, we have four belts [per division],\" Lomachenko said. \"We can't be talking about four different world champions. We can't. In boxing, we have only one champion, it's the undisputed world champion.\"\n\nAnd when he thinks back at how hard it used to be to get other champions to agree to face him, there remains a certain twinkle of motivation in Lomachenko's eye when he talks about his age, and the fact that he's fighting in a division above his preferred weight, which has suddenly given everyone confidence that he might be for the taking.\n\n\"I remember a time when I was the man and nobody wanted to fight,\" Lomachenko said. \"Now, of course, everyone wants to fight me because I became a year older. But, right now, I still feel dangerous. I still have my speed, my power, my conditioning. I just want to show my best.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_campbell@cbssports.com", "name": "Brian Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Haney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Haney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top Rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Arum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Arum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Boxing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promoter (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Boxing_Champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier Boxing Champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakur_Stevenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shakur Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gervonta_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gervonta Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/09/46d343ff-e5a0-4ed8-8ab2-7b0a9af91649/thumbnail/1200x675/4b23e9e1c6105c1d801cd431319714a3/vasiliy-lomachenko-haney-prefight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554039", "eventUri": "eng-9554039", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 4266, "textEnd": 4272}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Loma's a big hill to climb, but George is willing to fight the best and he gives 110 per cent. I think he's more prepared for this fight than in a long time.\"\n\nWhile it is a sold-out show in front of Kambosos' fans, DiBella believes the boxing public are not giving the Australian warrior a chance. Although big-time boxing is thriving Down Under overall, with many fighters operating at world level, there have been recent high-profile losses for Liam Wilson, Michael Zerafa, Tim Tszyu, and Jason Moloney.\n\nDiBella believes Kambosos is being written off by many. The Australian upset Teofimo Lopez in 2021, but suffered clear consecutive defeats to Devin Haney. He then toiled against Maxi Hughes, and was fortunate to get a decision against the crafty Englishman.\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" DiBella said, asked if Kambosos is being overlooked. \"And by the way, I think that [Devin] Haney was the worst possible style for Kambosos. Kambosos is not Joe Slick. He's going to have problems with a very, very fast technical sort of moving guy like Haney, who is a hard guy to fight, honestly. And now, with the weight blown up and the disrespect he [Ryan Garcia]'s shown for Haney in terms of missing the weight and showing up so heavy and now on top of it the tests, Haney's loss is not looking as bad.\"\n\nWhile a promoter cannot look too far beyond the next fight, and there is no chance anyone in the Australian's team is taking Lomachenko for granted, DiBella discussed some possible options for what might come next.\n\n\"It all hinges on what happens but I think with a good performance, and I'm not saying a win, I'm saying a really good performance, he'll always have the Teofimo Lopez fight,\" DiBella explained. \"So I think that is inevitably in his future. George is manifesting victory here. He's convinced that he is going to put on a great performance. He's a real fighter. George has no hesitation to fight anybody and he's been a road warrior for how long? Now he's had a couple of big fights in Australia but he fought [Lee] Selby in England, came to America, he has a mentality of a champion, 'I'll fight anybody'. And that's been shown by his resume. Yes, he lost twice to Haney, but if you look at who George has stepped in the ring with, he's a real champion.\"\n\nDiBella also promotes the aforementioned Hughes, who recently suffered a one-sided loss to the exceptional William Zepeda. Hughes had a nightmare camp in that when he arrived two weeks ahead of schedule in Las Vegas he was instantly sent back to the U.K. due to what immigration deemed incorrect documentation. Hughes spent the best part of the next week in a London hotel, ticking over, waiting for a U.S. Embassy appointment, which eventually was in Ireland, and he finally landed in Vegas at the start of fight week.\n\n\"Get him a win in an eight-rounder and maybe someone like [Gary] Cully,\" said DiBella, when asked what's next for Hughes. \"There are a lot of guys in the U.K. right now that Maxi would still beat, in my view. Maxi's not done.\n\n\"By the way, he's one of the nicest people. At this stage of my career, I want to work with people I like and respect and Maxi is just a gentleman, and he's a real fighter and he's a lovely person and a family guy and fighting for his family, a regular, solid kid and you want to see the best things happen for Maxi Hughes We will get Maxi back to probably a big U.K. fight, and he will show people what he's got left.\"\n\nThe same way that Kambosos has the Lopez bout to return to, is it the same with Hughes and Kambosos, given the controversy generated by the scorecards from their fight?\n\n\"The reality of the Kambosos fight is it was not the most-exciting,\" added DiBella. \"So it's not like there's a clamour for it, but if Maxi goes on a bit of a run, who knows?\n\n\"He wasn't going to complain,\" DiBella continued, talking about Hughes being sent back to the U.K. ahead of the Zepeda fight. \"We were bringing him in two weeks before the fight and he should have had no problem getting into the country, and a mistake was made at the border when he tried to get into America and he got sent back on the next plane, and had an ordeal of being in a hotel room [in London]. We had to work around the clock with lawyers to fix things. Because there was a mistake, we still had to fix it. We had to get him a new type of visa, and he didn't get into Vegas until the Monday night, when he was supposed to be there two weeks before. He didn't catch a break in that fight.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_DiBella", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lou DiBella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasiliy_Lomachenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vasiliy Lomachenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kambosos_Jr", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kambosos Jr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tszyu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Tszyu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Haney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devin Haney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Zerafa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Zerafa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Moloney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Moloney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liam Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Australian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Hughes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Garcia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Garcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Zepeda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Zepeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/george-kambosos_1706813350.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554039", "eventUri": "eng-9554039", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 161, "textEnd": 167}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

"title": "Boxing 2024: George Kambosos chances vs Vasiliy Lomachenko, Bob Arum interview, Sam Goodman vs Naoya Inoue, next fight, latest news", "body": "American promoter Bob Arum has revealed Australia's Sam Goodman may have to wait at least one more fight before facing Japanese megastar Naoya Inoue - while also declaring George Kambosos a \"real threat\" to upset his Ukranian superstar Vasiliy Lomachenko.\n\nIn an interview with Fox Sports Australia, the legendary Top Rank boss has also unveiled his plans to have recently dethroned bantamweight champ Jason Moloney return to Japan in just months to face undefeated Tenshin Nasukawa - who is most famous for throwing down against Floyd Mayweather in 2018.\n\nNow aged 92, Arum has arrived in Perth this week to watch Kambosos and Lomachenko fight for the IBF lightweight title inside a sold out RAC Arena.\n\nBoxing: Lomachenko v Kambosos IBF Lightweight World Title Fight | SUN 12 MAY 12PM AEST | Order Now with Main Event on Kayo Sports\n\nAs recently as Monday night, the promoter was also sitting ringside inside Japan's famed Tokyo Dome as Inoue, the undisputed super bantamweight king and another of his star clients, destroyed Luis Nery via brutal KO.\n\nImmediately after the fight, Australia's own rising star Goodman was ushered into the ring where, in no uncertain terms, he told the champion dubbed 'Monster' to either fight him or relinquish the straps.\n\nHowever, Arum revealed after Thursday's Kambosos press conference that Inoue's next showdown could be against Irishman TJ Doheny - who has scored three consecutive KO wins fighting in Japan.\n\nArum quickly added however that even if Doheny were to get first crack, Goodman \"will be fighting Inoue this year\".\n\nIronically, the fighter who now trains out of the Central Coast beat Doheny back in March last year - on the undercard of Tim Tszyu versus Tony Harrison - and has since won four straight to become mandatory for the IBF title.\n\nYet on Inoue's undercard on Monday, Doheny finished Filipino Bryl Bayogos within four rounds to have Arum confirm he is also now in the mix for a September fight in Japan.\n\nAnd if it is the Irishman who gets Inoue next, and becomes yet another Inoue, Goodman will then get his chance on a proposed December event in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The plan is for Inoue to fight again in Japan this September,\" Arum explained.\n\n\"And then depending on how everything breaks down from there, he would fight again at the end of the year, maybe in Riyadh.\n\n\"And both Sam Goodman and the Irish kid (Doheny) are great opponents.\n\n\"I had the opportunity to have a brief conversation with Sam this week in Tokyo and was very impressed with him and his demeanour.\n\n\"So whether he fights Inoue in September or December, I don't know.\n\n\"But he certainly will be fighting Inoue this year.\"\n\nArum also declared Kambosos, the reigning IBO lightweight champ, a genuine chance to secure the second big upset of his career when he looks to also earn the vacant IBF strap.\n\nHowever, the Top Rank CEO is already making plans for a Lomachenko victory and told Sky Sports earlier this week that, with a win, the future Hall of Famer will likely have a unification showdown with Shakur Stevenson, who he also promotes, later this year.\n\n\"If Lomachenko wins and Shakur, who is scheduled to fight in July wins, then for the fall we do a Lomachenko-Shakur fight,\" he said. \"Every serious boxing fan will be watching that in awe.\"\n\nSo what chance Kambosos again upsets and puts himself in the mix for yet another Top Rank star?\n\n\"The lightweight division is loaded with talented guys who are willing to fight,\" Arum continued.\n\n\"And you can't get better than two high caliber guys like Kambosos and Lomachenko.\n\n\"Former champions, great professionals, Kambosos is a real threat and this fight could go either way.\n\nThe promoter also said discussions were already underway to have Moloney back fighting in Japan within months after losing his WBO strap to Yoshiki Takei in the Tokyo Dome, Monday night.\n\nAfter a slow start to his title defence, Moloney enjoyed some success through the middle rounds and then, by the twelfth, exploded in such spectacular fashion it appeared he was going to knock Takei out.\n\nHowever, the local fighter clung on desperately to win the title via unanimous decision.\n\nNow this Sunday in Perth, it will be twin brother Andrew Moloney who looks to again win gold when he faces Mexico's Pedro Guevara for the interim WBC super flyweight title.\n\n\"And I love the Moloneys,\" Arum stressed.\n\n\"Ever since the pandemic, we've promoted all of their fights and they're just a real credit to the sport.\n\n\"A pair of great athletes who are also lovely young men.\n\n\"I'm delighted Andrew's getting the opportunity to fight for a world title - and I'll definitely be pulling for him - while Jason made such a good impression of himself in japan that they're thinking of bringing him back in a few months to face another kickboxer, Tenshin.\n\nWhile Nasukawa was, unsurprisingly, stopped in the first round of his exhibition fight against Mayweather six years ago, the former kickboxing champ also had a brief undefeated stint in MMA, where he was approached about signing for the UFC.\n\nInstead, the fighter regarded as one of the modern era's best kickboxers has now switched it up again, going undefeated in three fights since his professional debut last April.\n\nTeam Moloney are understood to be keen for that fight.\n\nArum added the showdown would be an interesting switch up for Moloney who came within seconds of retaining his world title Monday night.\n\n\"The other night in Japan, I thought Jason should have started earlier,\" the promoter said.\n\n\"It was clear to me the Japanese fighter was tiring.\n\n\"And if he had started in the tenth or even 11th round, guaranteed he would've knocked out his opponent.", "source": {"uri":

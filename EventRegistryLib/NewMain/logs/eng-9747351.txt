Vineyard Wind has not said what caused the damage, but nobody was injured in the incident.\n\nWhile initially, the broken portion of the 107-meter blade was hanging down from where it was still attached, on Wednesday night, Vineyard Wind said its condition was deteriorating and it would likely fall soon, which occurred the following morning.\n\nAs of Thursday, 56 people were working to clean up debris from the beaches and water, according to the town. Vineyard Wind is using models from the U.S. Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to predict where debris will travel. The debris was expected to stay south of the island Friday, due to wind from the north.\n\nBeaches on the southern shore of Nantucket were closed to swimming Tuesday because of the debris but have since reopened. The town said Friday the cleanup teams would also patrol the northern side of the island to ensure the area is ready for the Nantucket Triathlon, scheduled for Saturday.\n\nVineyard Wind is also developing a plan to conduct water testing around the island.\n\nThe company has said the debris is non-toxic but urged anyone who finds pieces of the debris to report them rather than touch or remove them themselves.\n\nAnyone who finds debris is asked to report it by calling 781-983-8943 or by sending a report directly to the cleanup contractor here.\n\nThe town said Friday that Vineyard Wind was working on setting up a process for financial claims.\n\n\"The impacts of this event will continue to unfold in the coming days and weeks,\" officials wrote. \"Vineyard Wind is fully responsible for the repercussions on Nantucket, and town administration and the Select Board will ensure they are held accountable.\"\n\nVineyard Wind, which is a joint venture between energy company Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure partners, began producing energy for the first time in January after the first turbine was installed in October 2023.

Vineyard Wind has not confirmed that the debris was actually from the blade.\n\nJames Hagerty, Edgartown town administrator, received a call from a Vineyard Wind representative Thursday night at 7 pm that some foam had potentially washed ashore around Wasque Point.\n\nHe put the offshore wind developer and the Trustees of Reservation -- managers of Wasque -- in communication with each other. He also spoke with town parks commissioners, who've so far found nothing on South Beach.\n\n\"During aerial surveillance, GE spotted potential debris at Wasque Point. The Trustees' staff is cooperating with GE and Vineyard Wind to ensure that any debris located on our beaches is properly retrieved,\" Darci Schofield, Island director for the Trustees, said in a statement to the Times. \"We ask beachgoers to use great care and alert our rangers to any possible debris they may spot on the beach or in the water. We continue to patrol the beaches searching for debris. The safety of our visitors and of the shorebirds we protect are our utmost priorities.\"\n\nGE Vernova is the company contracted to construct the turbines.\n\nThe Edgartown Parks Department has gone back and forth and surveyed the area and have yet to find anything.\n\n\"That doesn't mean it won't happen,\" Hagerty said. If debris does wash ashore, Hagerty said they'd make a judgment call that might be similar to Nantucket's decision to shut down their south shore beaches for a day.\n\n\"There's no reason to shut down anything right now,\" Hagerty added.\n\nLatest on turbine blade\n\nThe section of Vineyard Wind blade that fractured on Saturday has fallen to the ocean floor, Nantucket officials confirmed Friday morning.\n\nThe blade, made of a fiberglass shell and foam interior, is being monitored and will be recovered \"in due course,\" a note from the town states.\n\nThe latest follows a tough week for Vineyard Wind and the nascent offshore wind industry off the Northeast United States. It started on Saturday evening when one of the 350-turbine blades fractured. Federal officials are investigating the cause of the damage, but Vineyard Wind has since released few details of what happened.\n\nDebris from the initial fracture eventually washed ashore on Nantucket, leading the town to close several beaches on Tuesday. The beaches were reopened on Wednesday, and then on Thursday morning, Vineyard Wind reported that a significant portion of the turbine blade had dislodged and that more debris was expected to land on Nantucket shores.\n\nOn Friday, the town of Nantucket issued a statement -- calling the damaged blade a \"crisis\" -- that aside from confirming that the blade had sunk to the ocean floor, the town also said that Vineyard Wind is developing a plan to test water quality around the island.\n\nThe offshore wind company is also working on setting up a process for financial claims, the town of Nantucket reported.\n\nVineyard Wind crews -- which total 56 people as of Thursday -- are expected to continue removing debris along the south and north shores on Nantucket, in advance of a triathlon on Saturday.\n\nCriticism intensifies\n\nMeanwhile, criticism of the Vineyard Wind and GE continues to ramp up. As The MV Times reported Thursday, residents and business owners grilled executives at a Nantucket select board meeting.\n\nState officials have been critical as well. According to State House News Service, state house republicans voted against a state clean energy bill, citing the fractured turbine blade. House minority leader Brad Jones said the bill failed to hold developers to account.\n\n\"We don't know whether it's a one-off. We don't know whether it's something much more serious and systemic that's going to repeat itself,\" Jones told State House News Service. \"We're lucky there were no fatalities or injuries, but there were obviously beach closures, and obviously that's not something that you want to see on a recurring basis, not very sustainable from an energy perspective.\"\n\nState rep. Dylan Fernandes -- noting that turbines have been in operation successfully around the world -- told The Times that the incident is deeply concerning and that the development should be suspended until GE and Vineyard Wind make assurances that the fracture won't happen again.\n\nMore locally, some Islanders have had enough. Johnny and Otto Osmers, brothers and second-generation commercial fishermen out of Menemsha and Oak Bluffs, protested in front of the company's building in Vineyard Haven Friday afternoon.\n\nThey wanted to stand in solidarity with Nantucketers and show that though the company is called Vineyard Wind, not all Islanders support offshore wind development.\n\nIf all the South Shore beaches were closed here, as they were for at least a day in Nantucket, people would be outraged, they said.\n\nTo the brothers, offshore wind isn't green. \"We're worried about all the environmental impacts,\" Johnny Osmers said. \"A lot doesn't seem that green when you do the research.\"\n\n\"We're not climate change deniers,\" he added. As commercial fishermen, they see the effects of climate change first-hand, including warmer waters.\n\nBut they think there are better ways to get green energy, and that a lot of things were overlooked with this project. There wasn't a thorough look into long-term impacts, Johnny Osmers said.\n\nAt least four cars honked in support of the protesters, one yelling out of his truck, \"Yeah, F*** them.\"\n\nWhen asked what they thought about Friday morning's update that the rest of the blade fell to the seafloor, Osmers said, \"My question is, what are they going to do to remove the blade from the seafloor?\"\n\nTheir sign read: \"No more [wind farms] time to go fiberglass is toxic! Stop blaming fishermen, over 80 dead whales and sea turtles.\"\n\nThey were joined at around 12:45 pm by more protesters.\n\nMeantime, the U.S. Coast Guard continues to advise mariners to stay outside of the Vineyard Wind area. A warning issued on Friday says that two large pieces of debris are floating in nearby waters.", "source": {"uri": "mvtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Martha's Vineyard Times"},

The company's CEO, Klaus Moeller, left that meeting abruptly to address the \"integrity\" of the already damaged wind turbine blade.\n\nTown officials, residents and local mariners have all said they didn't learn of the incident until Monday evening, roughly 48 hours after the fact and just hours before debris started to wash ashore, prompting beaches to close Tuesday.\n\nBeaches have since reopened.\n\n\"We will continue to monitor this closely and do everything in our power to hold Vineyard Wind accountable for the impacts of this disaster, really,\" Mohr said. \"I've been calling it an incident, but it feels like more than that in terms of how it's impacting the feelings of safety in this community.\"\n\n\"I will reiterate one last time,\" she added, \"as soon as you know something, share it with us so we can plan and reassure our community that we are in the know on this.\"\n\nThis all comes as the blade failure, which popped up last Saturday about 21 miles south of Nantucket, continues to wreak havoc on the island.\n\nThe \"significant portion\" of the 107-meter blade that detached from the turbine Thursday morning sunk to the ocean floor. Crews were slated to recover the fiberglass \"in due course,\" town officials wrote in a Friday update.\n\n\"Approximately half of the fiberglass shell of the blade remains attached, while most of the foam fill dislodged during the initial failure last Saturday,\" officials wrote. \"Monitoring of the remaining attached piece is ongoing, and a plan is being developed for its removal.\"\n\nACK for Whales - a group of Nantucket residents concerned about the impacts of offshore wind development - voiced concern after the update came out.\n\n\"Is this supposed to make us feel better?\" the group posted on X. \"Now the big piece of debris is on the sea floor and pieces of fiberglass, adhesive materials and foam board will be seeping into the ocean until, when? TOXIC situation. UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nResidents are not taking kindly to Vineyard Wind's assertion that the debris - fiberglass fragments ranging in size from small pieces to larger sections, typically green or white - is not toxic.\n\nVineyard Wind has deployed a crew of 56 contractors to assist in the cleanup of the island's beaches, and town officials said Friday that no town staff are actively engaged in removing the debris.\n\nThe wind energy company reported Wednesday that crews had removed 17 cubic yards of debris, enough to fill more than six truckloads. On Friday, crews continued debris collection efforts across south shore beaches, along with Jetties Beach ahead of a triathlon on Saturday.\n\n\"The components of the debris observed to be floating offshore are a mix of foam and fiberglass pieces of varying sizes,\" town officials wrote Friday. \"Vessels crews will continue efforts to collect debris offshore to lessen the amount of debris landing on Nantucket beaches.\"\n\nAt least some of the debris has started washing ashore on Martha's Vineyard, according to trustees on the neighboring island.\n\n\"IMPORTANT NOTICE!

(Photo Credit: Worldview Films)\n\nby Bruce Mohl, CommonWealth Beacon\n\nVineyard Wind 1 officials said a \"significant part\" of the damaged 107-meter blade that was still clinging to a wind farm turbine fell into the ocean Thursday morning and warned residents of Nantucket and other coastal communities to brace for more debris washing up on their beaches.\n\nNantucket residents, who turned out in force at a Select Board meeting Wednesday evening, some of them describing the initial blade damage and resulting debris as an environmental disaster, knew more bad news was likely coming.\n\nAbout two hours into the Wednesday meeting, Klaus Skoust Moeller, the chief executive officer of Vineyard Wind, said he had to leave the meeting because he had been notified there was an emergency with the remainder of the blade that had been hanging from the turbine.\n\nSelect Board Chair Brooke Mohr told Moeller to go quickly. \"This is the definition of crisis management. Things change by the moment,\" she said.\n\nA statement released Thursday morning by the wind farm operators Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners said maritime crews had been preparing for the blade falling into the sea, but indicated there was relatively little they could do because of \"challenging weather conditions.\"\n\n\"We have deployed additional crews to Nantucket Island in anticipation that more debris could wash ashore tonight and tomorrow as we continue to monitor additional coastal communities,\" the companies said. \"If debris is found by members of the public, property owners, or local officials, they are advised to immediately contact our reporting hotline: 833-609-5768.\"\n\nThe debris so far has consisted primarily of foam and fiberglass, the inner workings of the blade. It was unclear whether the blade broke apart entirely when it fell into the ocean or whether it remained largely intact. That could make a big difference in the cleanup effort.\n\nBefore he left the Select Board meeting Wednesday night, Moeller said a ship with a boom has been deployed in the area but indicated it was unlikely it would be able to capture all the debris.\n\nAt the Select Board hearing, members of the panel and the public raised a host of concerns about the debris washing up on Nantucket. They worried about the potential for environmental damage and the danger of sharp-edged fiberglass on beaches.\n\nVineyard Wind officials and representatives of GE Vernova, the manufacturer of the wind farm's turbine and blades, sought to reassure the public but didn't have immediate answers to many of their questions.\n\n\"Something like this is highly unusual and rare,\" said Roger Martella, chief sustainability officer and head of government affairs at GE Vernova. He flew in from Europe for the meeting but couldn't get a flight to Nantucket so ended up joining via Zoom from Hyannis.\n\nMartella said all the material from the damaged turbine blade is being gathered to assess what happened. He said data from the wind farm is also being examined looking for anomalies.\n\nSelect Board member Matt Fee wondered whether a lightning strike on Saturday caused the initial damage, but GE officials said they had seen no burn marks on any of the material that had been gathered so far.\n\nVineyard Wind 1, regarded as the first industrial scale wind farm in the United States, is still under construction, although work has been halted since the damage to the turbine blade occurred on Saturday night. The wind farm is using a relatively new-to-market giant turbine called Haliade-X designed by GE Vernova. A single turbine is capable of generating 13 megawatts of power. Once completed, Vineyard Wind is expected to have 62 turbines.\n\nThis article first appeared on CommonWealth Beacon and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.", "source": {"uri": "renewableenergyworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Renewable Energy World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Select board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Wind_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GE Wind Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Infrastructure_Partners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avangrid", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avangrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turbine blade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightning strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental degradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyannis,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyannis, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyannis, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Oceanography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Oceanography", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/23-12-05_Vineyard_Wind_1-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747351", "eventUri": "eng-9747351", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The project is due to complete construction later this year.\n\n\"Vineyard Wind vessels are collecting fiberglass pieces on the site; a very large piece of debris is below the surface, in the water column,\" the town of Nantucket said Thursday, adding that Vineyard Wind hopes to retrieve that piece while it remains offshore. \"Vineyard Wind has advised that the majority of the interior foam from the entire blade was released on Saturday. However, additional debris could wash ashore tonight or tomorrow.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Nantucket Harbor Master Sheila Lucey warned island residents that the south shore beaches were closed to swimming \"due to large floating debris and sharp fiberglass shards.\" On Wednesday, those beaches were back open for swimming, but Lucey advised residents to use footwear and not bring their pets.\n\nBSEE's suspension order mandates that Vineyard Wind cease all power production until the agency can determine whether the blade failure affects any other turbines, and suspends installation of new turbines. The agency has also issued a preservation order to \"safeguard any evidence that may be relevant to determining the cause of the incident.\"\n\nThe Nantucket Select Board's meeting drew 1,600 virtual viewers and 230 total participants, the town said Wednesday. Representatives from Vineyard Wind and GE Vernova attended the meeting and answered questions, but were at times drowned out or interrupted by the audience.\n\n\"I know tensions are high here,\" said Chair Brooke Mohr while calling for order. In a video statement posted earlier that day, Mohr called the blade failure \"alarming and deeply concerning,\" and said the board would seek \"every remedy available\" to hold Vineyard Wind accountable.\n\nWhile addressing the board, Vineyard Wind CEO Klaus Moeller said he learned of the blade failure soon after it occurred Saturday night thanks to an alarm in the turbine.\n\n\"One of the blades on one of the positions was broken and folded over, bended over, and was not pointing in the direction that it should,\" he said. \"It's an automatic system, so the system actually shuts it down, and that's what happened here.\"\n\nVineyard Wind initially focused on \"bigger pieces [of debris] and got those secure\" before transporting them to New Bedford for analysis, Moeller said. \"Luckily, we know that none of this debris is toxic and there's no spill,\" he added, and was interrupted by loud coughing from the audience.\n\nLater, Moeller clarified, \"I didn't mean to imply that it was not serious or in some ways dangerous. I just meant that it was not a spill of oil or a substance like that. I am aware this is very serious, and that's why we want to recover everything.\"\n\nRenjith Viripullan, executive fleet engineering director at GE Vernova, said that the chemicals used in the blade are \"inert material\" and that the company doesn't see evidence so far that any additional components have been released into the water.\n\nHowever, Viripullan deferred a board member's question about whether the damaged blade could lead to PFAS contamination. \"We would take that question back, and we'll come back with that,\" he said.\n\nThe audience and the board questioned GE and Vineyard Wind's representatives about known rates of blade failure, but no clear answers emerged. The Department of Energy's Wind Energy Technologies Office said in an email that a 2015 report found catastrophic wind turbine failures occurred at a rate of \"0.1%, or 40 incidents in a fleet comprising 40,000 turbines installed in the United States,\" all of which were land-based at the time.\n\nDuring the meeting, Moeller announced he'd been informed of \"a development to the integrity of the blade,\" then left to meet with his team. Vineyard Wind's Senior Manager of Labor Relations and Workforce Development, Jennifer Cullen, later addressed the board to read an update from the project regarding \"an observed compromise to the integrity of the blade\" that evening.\n\n\"There has been a 500-meter safety zone implemented around the turbine and GE Vernova blade since Saturday night, and it has been under constant surveillance,\" Cullen said.\n\nThroughout the meeting, audience and board members remarked that they felt Vineyard Wind had failed to promptly notify them of the incident, citing a delay of 48 hours.\n\n\"I recognize that your statement is that you follow your regulatory requirements, and I just want to state for the record it was inadequate for this community,\" Mohr said. \"And hopefully you can answer as to how that would be different in the future.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Moeller said. \"I recognize that. We've gotten that feedback from the town also.... There's really no excuse. We need to well inform you.\"", "source": {"uri": "utilitydive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Utility Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "diana_digangi@utilitydive.com", "name": "Diana DiGangi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Infrastructure_Partners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avangrid", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avangrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Wind_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GE Wind Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bedford,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Bedford, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Bedford, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.utilitydive.com/imgproxy/tAfpGfJuD1kQJOyvMk6PSwTgDwDFDguasjsuz3iEgdQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTExMzg2MDA2ODguanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747351", "eventUri": "eng-9747351", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

A total of six south shore Nantucket beaches were closed to swimming due to debris that washed ashore.\n\n\"You can walk on the beaches, however we strongly recommend you wear footwear due to sharp, fiberglass shards and debris on the beaches,\" the Nantucket Harbormaster said.\n\nFiberglass shards are sharp, and splinters can be extremely painful and difficult to remove. Having a beach loaded with this debris at the height of tourist season seems...sub-optimum.\n\nThe blade had been newly installed and was undergoing commissioning testing when the failure occurred.\n\nCraig Gilvarg, a spokesperson for Vineyard Wind, said shortly after 2:30 p.m. that the cause of the incident is still unknown.\n\nSome time on Saturday, one of the three main 107-meter blades \"experienced a breakage approximately 20 meters out from the root,\" Gilvarg said. The affected turbine was still undergoing testing as part of its commissioning process.\n\nAlthough the damage threw debris into the water, the blade was not completely severed and most of it remains attached to the turbine, Gilvarg said. A photo published by the Nantucket Current showed one blade hanging directly downward, parallel to the tower.\n\nGE, which manufactured and installed the turbines and blades, will investigate the root cause, Gilvarg said.\n\nIn fact, the wind farm only started generating electricity in February.\n\nThe damage to the blade occurred on Saturday evening at Vineyard Wind, the country's second large-scale offshore wind farm, which is 14 miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. It's still under construction but the first turbines began generating electricity in February.\n\nThe companies behind the project, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, plan to install a total of 62 turbines by the end of the year that could, at full strength, produce 800 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power more than 400,000 homes.\n\nThe turbines being installed at Vineyard Wind are enormous, featuring 351-foot-long blades that can reach heights taller than the Eiffel Tower.\n\nBeege Welborne of Hot Air has some additional analysis, and noticed that the wind farm firm's notification timeline seems less than responsive.\n\nThe offshore wind company knew the turbine blade was blasted all to bits on Saturday but only notified the beach community of Nantucket on *checks notes* MONDAY.\n\nI have long chronicled the staggering failures of wind farms to live up to the hype. Scientific evidence and a serious review of the numbers shows that the power and reliability of wind pales in comparison to one traditional energy source.\n\nThis is just one more failure to add to the fail pile....fiberglass shards and all.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leslie_eastman@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Leslie Eastman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiberglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantucket,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nantucket, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vineyard_Wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vineyard Wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine_blade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbine blade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Infrastructure_Partners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avangrid", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avangrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eiffel Tower"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Surfing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Surfing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Kites", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Kites", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Traction", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Traction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/LI-63-Nantucket-Beaches.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747351", "eventUri": "eng-9747351", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

This time, from a foe the inhabitants are all in favor of - like illegals - as long as it's located somewhere else and their precious island remains uncontaminated by the sight and sound of them - again oddly enough, how residents treat illegals.\n\nJust two short days ago, I told you all about a massive wind turbine off the coast of Nantucket upon which one of its brand-new second set of three yet-to-be-operational blades had failed catastrophically.\n\n...A closer view of the turbine captured by a New Bedford fisherman named Anthony Seiger shows the blade might be mostly \"intact,\" but holy crap. It's so completely delaminated it looks like a football field-long package of fettuccine.\n\nThe operators of the Vineyard Wind project had taken two full days before alerting the townships on the island that said 300+ foot blade had blown itself to smithereens. The project operators did note they'd picked up three large fiberglass pieces out of the ocean nearby and that the blade was still largely \"intact,\" hanging like wet noodles from the turbine.\n\nNone of this was news to the folks on Nantucket as they had closed their beaches and were already busy trying to corral the volumes of styrofoam and fiberglass washing ashore in sizes huge or small and insidious.\n\nThe towns are in the nascent planning stages of how to go to war with the wind farm operators and GE, who manufactured the blades.\n\nYesterday, as the cleanup continued and the corporate tap-dancing commenced, the tons of fiberglass dangling off the towering structure decided to slip into the ocean on their own and not wait for the rescue net the company was trying to rig to catch it.\n\nAwkward.\n\nThe 300-foot blade remnants floated sadly atop the waves like Wilson the volleyball - posing a significant navigational hazard - before eventually slipping below the surface and coming to rest on the ocean bottom like a deformed leviathan who'd fought its last round. Yet another plan needs to be hatched to get that sucker out of there...eventually.\n\nA massive section of a damaged 350-foot turbine blade from a wind farm off the coast of Nantucket that detached Thursday morning has sunk to the ocean floor, town officials said Friday.\n\nThe large piece of fiberglass \"will be recovered in due course,\" they said.\n\n\"Approximately half of the fiberglass shell of the blade remains attached, while most of the foam fill dislodged during the initial failure last Saturday,\" Nantucket officials said in an update posted on the town's website. \"Monitoring of the remaining attached piece is ongoing, and a plan is being developed for its removal.\"\n\nThere's still plenty to scrape out of the water and sand as it is at this moment.\n\n...Crews are also collecting debris from areas that are more difficult to reach, the town said. The debris floating offshore is a \"mix of foam and fiberglass pieces of varying sizes,\" and crews \"will continue efforts to collect debris offshore to lessen the amount of debris landing on Nantucket beaches,\" town officials said.\n\nWith the arrival of a north wind on Friday morning, most debris path modeling programs showed that the flotsam and jetsam of the renewable energy, non-recyclable blade would be passing south of Nantucket, providing a bit of a breather for efforts on the island.\n\n...Some debris was found on Nobadeer Beach Friday morning. It was collected by Vineyard Wind's cleanup team, now made up of 56 employees and contractors on island.\n\n...Vessel crews will continue efforts to collect other debris offshore to lessen the amount landing on Nantucket beaches.\n\n...Vineyard Wind is managing all current and future cleanup efforts. No town staff are engaged in picking up debris anymore, except to serve in advisory roles, the town said.\n\nBut the debris is still IN the ocean, and lots of it. Odds are it's going to wash ashore somewhere.\n\nAnd so some of it has.\n\nMA Gov Maura Healy, who has been nearly as rabid and intractable a renewable advocate as verminous Murphy of New Jersey, had her Bojangle shoes on at a press conference yesterday.\n\n...Gov. Maura Healey on Thursday said state officials were on site with workers to clean up and remove debris, Axios Boston reported.\n\n\"We see the success of wind and wind turbines around the world that have been operating well and safely for decades,\" Healey told Axios. \"Obviously, something went wrong. There was a problem. We need to understand that, get to the bottom of it and make sure it's addressed.\"\n\n\"The offshore wind industry is a critical component of Massachusetts' economy and the country's transition to clean, affordable energy,\" Healey said in a later statement to The Light. \"It is essential that we gain a full understanding of what happened here and how it can be prevented in the future.\"\n\nI love how offshore is a \"critical component\" of the state's economy. The only part of the state's economy I see flourishing under her Green transition mandates are the utility companies and the Green grifters.\n\nMA is among the top ten in the country for utility costs. It's so Godawful expensive that \"to save money on utility bills,\" they literally go as far as recommending citizens dry their clothes outside \"even when it's cold.\"\n\nExperts offer tips on how to save money, including air-drying your laundry even when it's cold outside. ... That's right. What's a good fabric softener for February in New England?\n\nForbes may have ranked Massachusetts the most environmentally friendly state in the nation back in May, but that doesn't mean our energy costs are anything to celebrate.\n\nSolar panels, proper insulation, and heat pumps can help you save money, but when we do pay for energy, we're shelling out a lot. The state ranks sixth in the nation for energy costs, according to a study WalletHub released July 1.\n\nIt sounds like residents are getting hosed. Great job there, governor.\n\nEversource and National Grid, the major utilities in Massachusetts, are requesting rate hikes to enhance the power grid and accommodate the growing demand from electric vehicles and heat pumps. They are requesting approximately $2.4 billion over the next five years for grid improvements to convert the grid for renewable energy production and make it more resilient and capable of handling the surge in electrification. That is because Biden's and the state's climate agenda will result in Massachusetts homes consuming nearly three times as much electricity by 2050 than they do today. To deliver all that power, Eversource and National Grid will have to invest billions in grid infrastructure upgrades with ratepayers picking up much of the cost. The two utilities have asked the state Department of Public Utilities to begin the process of recouping their investments in converting the electric grid by raising rates over a five-year period.\n\nEversource is looking for state approval to pass on nearly $400 million of its costs over the next five years, while National Grid is seeking reimbursement for about $2 billion. Both utilities plan to recover money for other grid fixes through their regular rate filings. If these \"electric sector modernization\" plans get approved, five years from now, the average Eversource residential customer will pay nearly $5 a month more than today, while National Grid residential customers will pay an additional charge of nearly $7 a month, and neither amount includes the cost of the increased power that the home may be consuming by then. Current electric bills for both utilities average just over $200 a month.\n\nIn the meantime, Healy's little wind farm has just blown unknown volumes of toxins into the Atlantic. What about fishes, big and small, ingesting slivers and chunks of fiberglass and styrofoam? Fiberglass is damn near forever, is it not?\n\n...Republican state representatives this week cited the ongoing Vineyard Wind incident in their unanimous opposition to a Democrat-backed clean energy bill.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Brad Jones called the legislation, which seeks to expedite the permitting process for clean energy projects, a \"missed opportunity\" to address the \"catastrophic failure\" of the turbine, the State House News Service reported.\n\n\"We don't know whether it's a one-off. We don't know whether it's something much more serious and systemic that's going to repeat itself,\" Jones told the News Service. \"We're lucky there were no fatalities or injuries, but there were obviously beach closures, and obviously that's not something that you want to see on a recurring basis, not very sustainable from an energy perspective.\"\n\nTempers are fraying. It's as if everyone - who were, of course, little people traditionally ignored - who'd opposed this from the beginning and still got it shoved down their throats were just awarded the largest \"I told you so, now what are you going to do about it?\" in history.\n\nThe Biden administration has been handing out approvals for these offshore monstrosities in a headlong rush to get as many on the board as possible before they themselves are blown out of the water.\n\nThe blue-voting states that have enabled this disaster have no one to point the finger at but themselves.\n\nIf more debris makes it ashore in tony areas like Martha's Vineyard, maybe even Obama's back beach, we'll get to see just how many more of those 62 turbines finally get built offshore there.\n\nCan't have the garbage floating downstream, you know, after they worked so hard to keep it out of sight in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri":

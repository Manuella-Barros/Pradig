Dan Newhouse facing primary challenge from Tiffany Smiley", "body": "Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) gained a new GOP primary challenger on Monday after former Senate candidate Tiffany Smiley announced she would run against one of the last pro-impeachment House Republicans in 2024.\n\nNewhouse is one of two GOP members left in the House who voted in favor of impeaching former President Donald Trump. Though Washington state's jungle primary allowed for Newhouse to fend off primary opponents easily in 2022, the entry of Smiley, a middle-ground Republican who ran a competitive race against Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), could narrow the congressman's chances of reelection.\n\n\"It's time for fresh leadership,\" Smiley said in an interview with the National Review. \"We have an invasion at the border. We have unrest in our own country. We have an economy where families are struggling to keep up with the price increase, and we have unrest around the globe.\"\n\nIn a video announcing her candidacy, she drew on her experience with veterans advocacy after her husband, former Army Maj. Scotty Smiley, was blinded by a suicide car bomb in Iraq almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"For almost 20 years, I've worked to change the government from the outside. Now it's clear: The best way for me to continue my work and deliver change for Washington families is inside Congress,\" Smiley said.\n\nSmiley ran a close race against Murray leading up to the 2022 election, but the Democratic senator defeated her by nearly 15 points. During her 2022 campaign, Smiley told the Washington Examiner that she \"hates labels\" and wanted to find \"common ground\" with people regardless of political affiliation. Her attacks against Murray were more about leadership shortcomings than politically Republican motives.\n\nFollowing her loss, Smiley launched the Endeavor PAC to benefit Republican candidates running for Congress in 2024, contributing to campaigns such as David McCormick's in Pennsylvania and Tim Sheehy's in Montana.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nWhether she handles her race against Newhouse in a similar way she did against Murray remains to be seen. When running for Senate, she was doing so in a deep-blue state against a five-term Democratic incumbent, requiring Smiley to moderate some of her Republican stances to appeal to voters. However, considering Newhouse is one of two GOP members in Washington's House delegation and represents Washington's solid-red 4th District, Smiley may be able to use his vote to impeach Trump against him.\n\n\"That's not a vote that represents the voters of the Fourth District,\" Smiley told the National Review. \"Donald Trump is our nominee, and we need Donald Trump's policies in this country to save this country going forward. So given Newhouse's past history with Trump, I don't believe that Newhouse is the best person to legislate with a Trump administration.\"\n\nHowever, Smiley enters the primary against Newhouse at a slight disadvantage: A split Republican primary field could instead boost Newhouse's chances of reelection, particularly as Trump has already endorsed veteran and former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler in Washington's 4th District jungle primary. Sessler ran in 2022 and came in fourth place with just 12% of the vote.\n\nSmiley told the National Review she is undeterred despite a crowded challenger lineup.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"At this point, Sessler has been in the race for four years,\" she said. \"He's a perennial candidate, very low name recognition and no chance of winning.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Smiley and Newhouse for comment.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Dan Newhouse facing primary challenge from Tiffany Smiley - Washington Examiner", "body": "Newhouse is one of two GOP members left in the House who voted in favor of impeaching former President Donald Trump. Though Washington state's jungle primary allowed for Newhouse to fend off primary opponents easily in 2022, the entry of Smiley, a middle-ground Republican who ran a competitive race against Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), could narrow the congressman's chances of reelection.\n\n\"It's time for fresh leadership,\" Smiley said in an interview with the National Review. \"We have an invasion at the border. We have unrest in our own country. We have an economy where families are struggling to keep up with the price increase, and we have unrest around the globe.\"\n\nIn a video announcing her candidacy, she drew on her experience with veterans advocacy after her husband, former Army Maj. Scotty Smiley, was blinded by a suicide car bomb in Iraq almost 20 years ago.\n\n\"For almost 20 years, I've worked to change the government from the outside. Now it's clear: The best way for me to continue my work and deliver change for Washington families is inside Congress,\" Smiley said.\n\nSmiley ran a close race against Murray leading up to the 2022 election, but the Democratic senator defeated her by nearly 15 points. During her 2022 campaign, Smiley told the Washington Examiner that she \"hates labels\" and wanted to find \"common ground\" with people regardless of political affiliation. Her attacks against Murray were more about leadership shortcomings than politically Republican motives.\n\nFollowing her loss, Smiley launched the Endeavor PAC to benefit Republican candidates running for Congress in 2024, contributing to campaigns such as David McCormick's in Pennsylvania and Tim Sheehy's in Montana.\n\nWhether she handles her race against Newhouse in a similar way she did against Murray remains to be seen. When running for Senate, she was doing so in a deep-blue state against a five-term Democratic incumbent, requiring Smiley to moderate some of her Republican stances to appeal to voters. However, considering Newhouse is one of two GOP members in Washington's House delegation and represents Washington's solid-red 4th District, Smiley may be able to use his vote to impeach Trump against him.\n\n\"That's not a vote that represents the voters of the Fourth District,\" Smiley told the National Review. \"Donald Trump is our nominee, and we need Donald Trump's policies in this country to save this country going forward. So given Newhouse's past history with Trump, I don't believe that Newhouse is the best person to legislate with a Trump administration.\"\n\nHowever, Smiley enters the primary against Newhouse at a slight disadvantage: A split Republican primary field could instead boost Newhouse's chances of reelection, particularly as Trump has already endorsed veteran and former NASCAR driver Jerrod Sessler in Washington's 4th District jungle primary. Sessler ran in 2022 and came in fourth place with just 12% of the vote.\n\nSmiley told the National Review she is undeterred despite a crowded challenger lineup.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"At this point, Sessler has been in the race for four years,\" she said. \"He's a perennial candidate, very low name recognition and no chance of winning.\"", "source": {"uri":

But now it's clear that the best place for me to continue my work and deliver real change for Washington families is inside the halls of Congress,\" Smiley said in her announcement.\n\n\"Washington-04 has always been my home, and our friends and neighbors here have always had our backs -- in our highest highs and lowest lows. There is a lot of work to do, and I hope those same friends and neighbors will join me as I run to be their voice and have their backs as the next representative of WA-04,\" she continued.\n\nThe Pasco Republican's announcement complicates things for Newhouse, the five-term incumbent, and Jerrod Sessler, the Trump-endorsed challenger also looking to unseat him.\n\nMany moderate Republicans are skeptical that former President Donald Trump, who is running this year in a rematch against his political rival, President Joe Biden, can rally the party and make gains in the Evergreen State.\n\nBut support within Washington's 4th District -- the state's most conservative congressional district, where Trump overwhelmingly beat Biden by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2020 election -- doesn't appear to have waned. Many of the district's most conservative voters and activists, including Sessler, still remain upset over Newhouse's 2021 vote to impeach the former president for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nFiling period for open races throughout Washington state kicked off Monday.\n\nCandidates running for elected office this year must file paperwork with the Washington Secretary of State's Office from May 6-May 10.\n\nOnly the top two with the most votes -- no matter which political party -- in the Aug. 6 primary election can move on to the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nA crowded field of conservatives could spell disaster again for MAGA Republicans, who in 2022 bloated the primary in an attempt to oust Newhouse and inadvertently allowed a progressive Democrat, Doug White, to advance to the general election.\n\nSo far no Democrats have announced a plan to run this year for Newhouse's seat.\n\nThe 4th Congressional District encompasses central Washington, stretching from the U.S.-Canada border down to the Columbia River. It includes the Tri-Cities, Yakima, Yakama Indian Reservation, Moses Lake, East Wenatchee and Omak.\n\nVeterans advocate\n\nA Pasco native and current Tri-Cities resident, Smiley put her career as a triage nurse on hold after her high school sweetheart and husband, Scotty Smiley, a West Point graduate, was injured by a suicide car bomber while deployed in Mosul, Iraq.\n\nThe incident blinded Scotty Smiley and turned his wife into an overnight activist for wounded veterans.\n\nWhile her husband was still in a coma in trauma care, she was asked to sign a document for his immediate discharge from the Army.\n\nShe refused and her husband became the first blind active-duty Army officer, with duties that included teaching at West Point and commanding the Warrior Transition Unit at West Point's Keller Army Medical Center.\n\n\"During Scotty's recovery at Walter Reed, Tiffany became his voice and advocate -- standing up to the military bureaucracy to fight for his dreams and the care he had earned,\" Smiley's campaign wrote.\n\nHer work to make sure that her husband's recovery was not compromised by inefficient government bureaucracy expanded to ensure other veterans received the benefit and care they deserve. She worked across the political aisle to achieve reform at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn 2022, Smiley challenged U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who was first elected to the seat in 1993. Despite polling that suggested a competitive race, Smiley lost to Murray by 14 percentage points in a blowout.\n\nMonths later, Smiley launched a new political action committee, Endeavor PAC, in an effort to back outsider conservative candidates. But donations given to that PAC were also reportedly used to settle a lingering debt Smiley had in her run against Murray, the Seattle Times reported.\n\n5-term incumbent\n\nNewhouse is a lifelong Central Washington resident and businessman. He's a third-generation Yakima Valley farmer and continues to operate an 850-acre farm that grows hops, tree fruit and grapes.\n\nHe previously served in the Washington Legislature, from 2003 to 2009, and as director of Washington State's Department of Agriculture, from 2009 to 2013.\n\nNewhouse won election to the U.S. House in 2014, succeeding former Congressman Doc Hastings. He currently serves on the House's Appropriations Committee.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the Sunnyside Republican was the only candidate to have registered with the Washington Secretary of State's office to run in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\nSessler, a Prosser businessman, was one of six Republicans who attempted to oust Newhouse in 2022.\n\nLast month, Trump gave a full-throated endorsement of Sessler, blessing the MAGA candidate's challenge and calling Newhouse a \"weak and pathetic RINO,\" or Republican in name only.\n\nSessler also earned his state party's endorsement at the Washington State Republican Party Convention in Spokane two weeks ago.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_rosane@theolympian.com", "name":

But now it's clear that the best place for me to continue my work and deliver real change for Washington families is inside the halls of Congress,\" Smiley said in her announcement.\n\n\"Washington-04 has always been my home, and our friends and neighbors here have always had our backs -- in our highest highs and lowest lows. There is a lot of work to do, and I hope those same friends and neighbors will join me as I run to be their voice and have their backs as the next representative of WA-04,\" she continued.\n\nThe Pasco Republican's announcement complicates things for Newhouse, a five-term incumbent, and Jerrod Sessler, the Trump-endorsed challenger also looking to unseat him.\n\nMany moderate Republicans are skeptical that former President Donald Trump, who is running this year in a rematch against his political rival, President Joe Biden, can rally the party and make gains in the Evergreen State.\n\nBut support within Washington's 4th District -- the state's most conservative congressional district, where Trump overwhelmingly beat Biden by nearly 20 percentage points in the 2020 election -- doesn't appear to have waned. Many of the district's most conservative voters and activists, including Sessler, still remain upset over Newhouse's 2021 vote to impeach the former president for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nFiling period for open races throughout Washington state kicked off Monday.\n\nCandidates running for elected office this year must file paperwork with the Washington Secretary of State's Office from May 6-May 10.\n\nOnly the top two with the most votes -- no matter which political party -- in the Aug. 6 primary election can move on to the general election on Nov. 5.\n\nA crowded field of conservatives could spell disaster again for MAGA Republicans, who in 2022 bloated the primary in an attempt to oust Newhouse and inadvertently allowed a progressive Democrat, Doug White, to advance to the general election.\n\nSo far no Democrats have announced a plan to run this year for Newhouse's seat.\n\nThe 4th Congressional District encompasses central Washington, stretching from the U.S.-Canada border down to the Columbia River. It includes the Tri-Cities, Yakima, Yakama Indian Reservation, Moses Lake, East Wenatchee and Omak.\n\nVeterans advocate\n\nA Pasco native and current Tri-Cities resident, Smiley put her career as a triage nurse on hold after her high school sweetheart and husband, Scotty Smiley, a West Point graduate, was injured by a suicide car bomber while deployed in Mosul, Iraq.\n\nThe incident blinded Scotty Smiley and turned his wife into an overnight activist for wounded veterans.\n\nWhile her husband was still in a coma in trauma care, she was asked to sign a document for his immediate discharge from the Army.\n\nShe refused and her husband became the first blind active-duty Army officer, with duties that included teaching at West Point and commanding the Warrior Transition Unit at West Point's Keller Army Medical Center.\n\n\"During Scotty's recovery at Walter Reed, Tiffany became his voice and advocate -- standing up to the military bureaucracy to fight for his dreams and the care he had earned,\" Smiley's campaign wrote.\n\nHer work to make sure that her husband's recovery was not compromised by inefficient government bureaucracy expanded to ensure other veterans received the benefit and care they deserve. She worked across the political aisle to achieve reform at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn 2022, Smiley challenged U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who was first elected to the seat in 1993. Despite polling that suggested a competitive race, Smiley lost to Murray by 14 percentage points in a blowout.\n\nMonths later, Smiley launched a new political action committee, Endeavor PAC, in an effort to back outsider conservative candidates. But donations given to that PAC were also reportedly used to settle a lingering debt Smiley had in her run against Murray, the Seattle Times reported.\n\n5-term incumbent\n\nNewhouse is a lifelong Central Washington resident and businessman. He's a third-generation Yakima Valley farmer and continues to operate an 850-acre farm that grows hops, tree fruit and grapes.\n\nHe previously served in the Washington Legislature, from 2003 to 2009, and as director of Washington State's Department of Agriculture, from 2009 to 2013.\n\nNewhouse won election to the U.S. House in 2014, succeeding former Congressman Doc Hastings. He currently serves on the House's Appropriations Committee.\n\nAs of Monday morning, the Sunnyside Republican was the only candidate to have registered with the Washington Secretary of State's office to run in the Aug. 6 primary.\n\n\"We live in challenging times when strong leaders are needed to ensure a safe and prosperous future for our children and our nation. I am humbled by the honor of representing Central Washington in Congress, and I look forward to continuing this important work,\" Newhouse said in a Monday statement.\n\nSessler, a Prosser businessman, was one of six Republicans who attempted to oust Newhouse in 2022.\n\nLast month, Trump gave a full-throated endorsement of Sessler, blessing the MAGA candidate's challenge and calling Newhouse a \"weak and pathetic RINO,\" or Republican in name only.\n\nSessler also earned his state party's endorsement at the Washington State Republican Party Convention in Spokane two weeks ago.",

This will also contribute to Equinor's Energy Transition Plan to reach net zero by 2050, it said.\n\nThe Bacalhau field is situated in the Santos Basin and is operated by Equinor (40 percent), in partnership with ExxonMobil (40 percent), Petrogal Brasil (20 percent), and PPSA (a government company). Equinor took over as the operator in 2016, and the company anticipates producing its first oil in 2025.\n\nEquinor said that this is the first project in the Brazilian pre-salt area to be entirely developed by an international operator.\n\nLocated in the Campos Basin, Raia comprises three pre-salt discoveries: P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar, G\u00e1vea, and Seat. They contain natural gas and oil/condensate recoverable reserves of above one billion barrels of oil equivalent (Boe), according to Equinor. The field is operated by Equinor (35 percent), in partnership with Repsol Sinopec (35 percent) and Petrobras (30 percent).\n\nEquinor said that Peregrino is the largest production field that it operates outside Norway, with a daily production of 110,000 barrels of oil. The field consists of a floating production storage and offloading platform, supported by three fixed platforms: Alfa, Bravo, and Charlie.

From the familiar faces of Noel Dempsey and \u2018Boxer\u2019 Moran to Lynn Boylan\u2019s vast popularity in one area, the Irish Independent has a run through of some the interesting and quirky elements of the day\u2019s proceedings so far: \u2018Hard to watch\u2019 Former minister Noel Dempsey says he is finding it \u201cmuch harder\u201d to watch the tallymen and women in action than he did when his votes were being counted as his daughter Aisling makes another bid for Meath County Council. With a quarter of the boxes open in Trim, Aisling, a sitting Fianna F\u00e1il councillor who works for Glenveagh Homes, held 8pc of the vote. \u2018Boxer\u2019 packs a punch We\u2019re sure you remember Kevin \u2018Boxer\u2019 Moran? The former minister of State between 2017 and 2020. This time he\u2019s up for election to Laois County Council. And he\u2019s looking in good shape to succeed based on the early tallies. \u2018When I lost my seat a number of years ago, it was a big blow and a big hurt, put I have put it behind me,\u201d Boxer told the Irish Independent. \u201cI did a great canvass, we put a huge campaign and I put in the hard work, and the people of Athlone and the surrounding areas are all supporting me. \u201cOne thing I heard while canvassing was people telling me \u2018Boxer, I hope this is your step forward and we\u2019ll get you back into the D\u00e1il\u2019. That\u2019s the plan but we take nothing for granted \u2013 we enjoy today.\u201d Second tally sheet needed Lynn Boylan got so many votes in a Ballymun box on the northside of Dublin that a second tally sheet was needed to count her votes. The Sinn F\u00e9in MEP frontrunner got 46pc of the votes in the box with her running mate Daith\u00ed Doolan getting another six per cent. So that was a combined total of 51pc for Sinn F\u00e9in. It's a heartland for the party, but that's still impressive. But Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael barely registered any votes. Independent Niall Boylan also did pretty well at 13pc and Independent Clare Daly was on 12pc. A spoilt vote mix-up The spoilt votes coming out are frightening. On the European ballot papers there are clearly voters continuing their preferences from the local elections sheet. Multiple papers came out of a box with numbers on them that indicated people had voted 1, 2, 3 on the previous paper. The Electoral Commission are in the RDS for the count to specifically study spoiled votes. So expect a bigger, brighter and better information campaign next time around. Tough day for minister\u2019s son It's a tough day at the Laois office for first time candidate Charlie Hackett (20). Minister Pippa Hackett was on site in Laois to support her son in his first election. Early tallies suggest he would not be contesting for one of the six seats in the Graiguecullen/Portarlington district. How long is a piece of...ballot paper? Tallies can usually give a good indication of voters\u2019 intentions but in this case some of the European tallies were discounted as soon as they begun. They were too difficult to keep track of. Why? There were simply too many names on the sheet... The piece of paper was too long. Lovely Wickloos We\u2019ve heard of count centres at five-star hotels...but do their toilet facilities match up to that of the portaloos outside Shoreline Leisure Centre, where the Wicklow count is taking place? Leo up early in the morning It was his probably now infamous phrase, but Leo Varadkar showed that even after stepping down as Taoiseach this year, he\u2019s still an early bird, as he scanned the ballots in the RDS this morning Quota reached Galway County Council\u2019s count staff were quicker than anyone else, as they were the first to declare a councillor elected. That was Thomas Welby in Connemara North.

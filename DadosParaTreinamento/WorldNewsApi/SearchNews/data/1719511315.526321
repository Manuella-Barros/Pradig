{"id": 223762822, "title": "&#8216;Furiosa,&#8217; &#8216;Garfield&#8217; in Tight No. 1 Race, But Memorial Day Box Office Sinks to 26-Year Low", "text": "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and Sony/Alcon/DNEG\u2019s \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d are in a narrow race for the No. 1 spot at the Memorial Day box office. But no matter who wins, theaters are losing, as overall totals for the holiday weekend are the lowest they\u2019ve been since 1998. Industry estimates currently have both films earning 3-day openings of $25 million and 4-day openings of approximately $31 million, with Sony projecting a $31.8 million 4-day for \u201cGarfield\u201d while Warner Bros. is holding off on 4-day estimates until Monday. Regardless, that\u2019s the lowest total for a No. 1 Memorial Day film since \u201cCasper\u201d in 1995, while the overall estimated 4-day total of $127.7 million is a sharp 38% drop from last year\u2019s Memorial Day weekend. It\u2019s a drop that can be attributed to an industry-wide slump as Hollywood and exhibitors weather weeks of reduced theatrical output due to delays caused by last year\u2019s strikes, including Marvel Studios\u2019 highly anticipated \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which moved from May to late July and left theaters without their customary comic book boost to kick off the summer. The films that remain have not been able to carry the load, as only one film since the start of April \u2014 Disney/20th Century\u2019s \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d \u2014 has earned a 3-day opening above $30 million. For Sony, \u201cGarfield\u201d will turn a theatrical profit, as the animated family film holds a reported budget of $60 million before marketing that was financed by Alcon Entertainment. Audience reception for the film is mixed with an 83% Rotten Tomatoes audience score and a B+ on CinemaScore \u2014 a grade that is low for a family title \u2014 but with $66.3 million already grossed worldwide and three weeks of play time before Disney/Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d arrives, \u201cGarfield\u201d should easily clear the break-even point. \u201cFuriosa,\u201d on the other hand, won\u2019t be riding eternal, shiny and chrome. Carrying a $168 million budget, the \u201cMad Max\u201d prequel is opening well short of the $45.4 million 3-day start of \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d which grossed $379 million worldwide against a $150 million budget in 2015. \u201cFuriosa\u201d is getting strong reviews with Rotten Tomatoes scores of 89% critics and 91% audience. But \u201cFury Road\u201d got even stronger scores along with the same CinemaScore grade as \u201cFuriosa\u201d with a B+ and 4.5/5 on PostTrak. Overseas numbers are still forthcoming, but there are no signs that \u201cFuriosa\u201d can match the performance of its Oscar-winning predecessor, something it needs to do to break even theatrically. It\u2019s a tough weekend for Warner after the studio enjoyed several box office successes during the winter and spring, including Timothee Chalamet\u2019s holiday hit \u201cWonka\u201d and the Legendary Pictures one-two punch of \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and \u201cGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire,\u201d not to mention the record-breaking success of \u201cBarbie\u201d that the studio is not even a year removed from. Paramount\u2019s \u201cIF\u201d is in third with a 3-day opening of $16.1 million \u2014 a 52% drop from its opening weekend \u2014 and $21 million over four days. After its so-so $33.7 million start, the John Krasinski family film needed to find its own lane among audiences while \u201cGarfield\u201d skewed towards parents with younger kids, and that is bearing out as the $110 million film tries to turn its strong word-of-mouth into theatrical profit with a two-weekend total of $63.5 million and $103.6 million worldwide. Disney/20th Century\u2019s \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes\u201d is in fourth with a $17 million 4-day total, bringing its cume to $126.5 million domestic while it sits on the threshold of $300 million worldwide. The fourth \u201cApes\u201d reboot film continues to show strong holds in most of the world and will pass the $146.8 million domestic total of \u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes.\u201d But the film will likely fall short of the $490 million global total of its 2017 predecessor due simply to the industry-wide drop for Hollywood films in China. \u201cKingdom\u201d has just made $25.3 million in that country compared to $112 million for \u201cWar.\u201d Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d is in fifth with $7.6 million over four days, as the $125 million action comedy continues its poor run with $73.8 million domestic and $143.8 million worldwide. Farther down the charts, Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cSight\u201d opened in 2,100 locations and grossed an industry-estimated $3.5 million over four days. The inspirational true story drama of an eye surgeon who restored the sight of a blind orphan has received a 63% critics RT score while receiving an A on CinemaScore from an audience largely consisting of the loyal following Angel Studios has built in the wake of last year\u2019s breakout hit \u201cSound of Freedom.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Overall box office totals for the holiday weekend plummet 38% from last year</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/furiosa-garfield-weak-memorial-day-weekend-box-office/\">&#8216;Furiosa,&#8217; &#8216;Garfield&#8217; in Tight No. 1 Race, But Memorial Day Box Office Sinks to 26-Year Low</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com\">TheWrap</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/furiosa-garfield-weak-memorial-day-weekend-box-office/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/052224-Garfield-Furiosa-Image.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:39:39", "author": "Jeremy Fuster", "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.162}

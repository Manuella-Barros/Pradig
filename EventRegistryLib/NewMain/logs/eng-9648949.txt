The Boys season 4 begins with a surprising task for Homelander, recruiting new members of The Seven. With Queen Maeve no longer on the team and Starlight publicly quitting, The Seven roster hasn't actually matched its name since season two, so there are three empty spots on the team. Homelander makes one of his selections, choosing Sister Sage (series newcomer Susan Heyward, Orange Is the New Black) for the position. It's clear that the reason Homelander has picked her is because of her power, she's the smartest person in the world, and she makes that known with immediate observations about Homelander that prove she's someone you want on your side.\n\nAfter Homelander picks Sister Sage as his first appointment he then tasks her (and her power) to decide who will get the next seat (she eventually picks Firecracker, doing so because she believes her powers would make her an ally in defeating/killing Starlight). The next job that Homelander decides for Sister Sage is even bigger though, handing over the responsibilities of being Vought CEO to her directly.\n\nThis marks the third CEO of Vought in the history of The Boys TV series. Giancarlo Esposito's Stan Edgar was the leader of the company for the first three seasons, only to be replaced by Ashley Barrett after his forced retirement. As Vought's new CEO, Sister Sage quickly makes moves, after selecting Firecracker for The Seven (which Homelander immediately questions) she informs Ashley that while she's no longer CEO, she's the company's mascot. Sage then reveals to The Seven that she's already aware someone stole security camera footage from Vought that exonerated the Starlighters over the three dead men that were found at the riot. She questions The Deep, though we know that A-Train is the real leak, and even begins interrogating Crime Analytics members (who Homelander quickly kills despite her protests).\n\nAs you can imagine, Ashley doesn't take too kindly to having her job taken away and instead made into a public-facing figure that has no real power. Granted, it's at least revealed she has a little bit of power as she's revealed to have Vought news anchor Cameron Coleman chained up in her office as a humiliation fetish. Ashley also considers quitting, but after watching Homelander quickly kill a Vought staff member over nothing, she decides to stick around.\n\nLater, Sage accompanies Homelander to a meeting with Vice President-elect Neuman where she confirms that Firecracker's position on The Seven was her idea. She intends to use Firecracker to eliminate Starlight, which will pave the way for the three of them (Homelander, Neuman, and Sister Sage) to have President-elect Robert Singer killed as well after the election is certified. When she that happens, Neuman will become president, and in return Sage tells her she's to:\n\nDisband the Department of SuperHuman Affairs Condemn the \"Defund the Supes\" movement Remove all books and teachers that reach Critical Supe Theory Place a supe in every town with authority of the police Finally, she comes out and reveals she's a supe president\n\nNeuman doesn't agree to all of this just yet, as their meeting is interrupted when Homelander realizes that Hughie is spying on them. Neuman is worried that The Boys will out her as a supe if he's killed by Homelander, but the seed has been planted about a government overthrow, and that part doesn't appear to be objectionable to Neuman.\n\nIn The Boys season 4, Karl Urban stars once again as Billy Butcher, leader of The Boys, which also includes Jack Quaid as Hughie Campbell, Laz Alonso as M.M., Tomer Capone as Frenchie, and Karen Fukuhara as Kimiko Miyashiro. Some of the \"supes\" featured in the series include Antony Starr as Homelander, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, and Chace Crawford as The Deep. Other stars of The Boys include Colby Minifie as Ashley Barrett, CEO of Vought International, and Claudia Doumit as Victoria Neuman.\n\nThe Boys season 4 will premiere with three episodes on Thursday, June 13, 2024 on Prime Video, with new episodes debuting weekly until The Boys season 4 finale premieres on Thursday, July 18. Prime Video describes the new season as follows:\n\nThe world is on the brink. Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the muscly thumb of Homelander, who is consolidating his power. Butcher, with only months to live, has lost Becca's son as well as his job as The Boys' leader. The rest of the team are fed up with his lies. With the stakes higher than ever, they have to find a way to work together and save the world before it's too late.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Is_the_New_Black", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange Is the New Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Esposito", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Esposito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

As this is happening, Homelander is discovering the limits of the ultimate power he just gained. Conversely, Billy Butcher is finding out just how powerless he actually is. In brief, The Boys Season 4, Episode 1, \"The Department of Dirty Tricks\" is an excellent start to one of the finest political satires on television today.\n\nThe episode title may seem like a reference to politics, but \"the Dirty Tricks Department\" is what the Office of Special Services was called during World War II. Stanley Lovell created a number of devices that didn't just help the Allies defeat the Nazis, but made the U.S. the Intelligence powerhouse it is today. This real-life \"Q\" from the James Bond films simply wanted to save his country and the world. Ironically, this is what motivates Homelander, too, because he wants to give his son a world where supes can do anything they want to. Everyone in this episode is practicing the Art of Dirty Tricks, from Victoria Neumann's desire for a truce or even an alliance with the Boys, to Homelander recruiting the smartest person in the world for the Seven.\n\nThe Boys Season 4, Episode 1 Draws Directly From Real-World U.S. Politics\n\nThe Donald Trump and Homelander Comparisons Are More Obvious Than Ever\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Spoiler-Free Review: The Boys Dare to Be Hopeful Before Blowing Everything Up\n\nThe Boys Season 4 is full of what fans love from gory violence to superheroes behaving badly, but before everything blows up, the show gets hopeful.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential race, eventual winner Donald Trump said he could \"shoot someone\" in broad daylight and not lose any votes. The final scene of The Boys Season 3 put that theory into practice by using its frequent satirical Trump stand-in, Homelander. After a \"Starlighter\" threw a water bottle at him and hit Ryan instead, Homelander used his laser vision to kill him. It took just one person, specifically Janine Milk's stepfather Todd, to cheer, and the assembled crowd all supported the murderous act.\n\nJust weeks before The Boys' Season 4 premiere, presumptive 2024 presidential nominee Trump was recently found guilty of 34 felony criminal counts. In a very overt parallel to current events, Homelander is approaching the verdict portion of his own trial for killing the counter-protester. The Vought Media machine labeled Homelander's actions as self-defense and accused the victim of being an \"ANTIFA\" member and \"a pedophile\" to turn the public against him. Homelander even directly quotes the former United States President in the episode, referring to \"s***hole countries\" during one of his speeches.\n\nHowever, in a continuation of this satirical attack on Trump, Homelander is at least smart enough to realize he's surrounded himself with \"sycophants\" and \"morons.\" Conversely, his real-life counterpart lacks this level of self-awareness. Enter Sage, though Vought added \"Sister\" to her name because she's a Black woman. According to Vought and others, Sage is the smartest woman and person in the world. Homelander says he's \"smart enough to listen\" to her without letting his ego cloud his judgment. In fact, the first teaser trailer for The Boys Season 4 has Sage explaining the overall story arc and Homelander's ultimate goal. As it turns out, Homelander wants to take over the world. Literally.\n\nThe Boys Are Now a Proper CIA Organization With a New Leader\n\nMother's Milk Takes Over for Billy Butcher and Starlight Officially Joins the Team\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys to End With Season 5, Showrunner Releases Statement\n\nThe Boys showrunner Eric Kripke announces that the acclaimed superhero drama series will conclude with its upcoming fifth season.\n\n\"The Dirty Tricks Department\" opens with the Boys attempting to kill Victoria Neumann with acid, specifically replacing it with her eyedrops. However, the first operation with Mother's Milk in charge goes sideways. Butcher gets made by Zoe, Victoria's 12-year-old daughter she injected with Compound V in the Season 3 finale. She has a truly horrifying power; four beastly tubules that extend from her mouth and devour human flesh. Starlight tries to use her power to save Frenchie and Kimiko, but she's only able to hold the former. Luckily, Kimiko can take an eight-story fall, though the resulting bodily harm is not pretty.\n\nThe Boys are currently working with Butcher's old mentor, Grace Mallory, and President-Elect Robert Singer, who has Neumann as his Vice. Singer thinks Neuman will kill him to become president, while Neumann's agenda is truly her own. However, Homelander inserts himself into her electoral moment. She will likely be crucial to future plans to wrest control of the nation and the world from Homelander. Unsurprisingly, her true allegiances and goals are still up in the air. What's most remarkable about the team in Season 4 is that Butcher is no longer in charge. With Mother's Milk at the helm, they've \"somehow become worse at [their] jobs,\" according to Neumann.\n\nYet, there's a scene in which the Boys' headquarters in New York's Flat Iron building feels like an actual office. Starlight is testing her powers with Hughie, as Marvin struggles with computer security. Near the end of the episode, Frenchie, Kimiko and Mother's Mlik even accidentally crack Homelander's conspiracy to commit murder and blame it on the Starlighters. They see Todd with Sage and Homelander, then later find his and two other bodies at the post-Homelander verdict riot, which Sage agitated. To top it all off, the relationship between Frenchie and Kimiko seems to be platonic, leaving the former free to pursue a new romantic interest: Colin. Despite the odds and some initial bumps along the way, the Boys are arguably a tighter and more cohesive unit than they were under Butcher's command.\n\nBilly Butcher Is Having a Whole Mess of Trouble\n\nAlong With Losing The Boys, He's Dying and Seeing His Dead Wife\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys Showrunner Teases What to Expect from Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Character in Season 4\n\nThe Boys creator Eric Kripke plugs Jeffrey Dean Morgan's mysterious Season 4 character and his dynamic with Karl Urban's Billy Butcher.\n\nThe first time audiences see Butcher in The Boys Season 4, he appears to be breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to viewers. Later, before he meets Neumann in a backhanded attempt at an alliance to kill Homelander, he speaks towards the camera again. By the end of the premiere episode, it's revealed he's talking to a mental image of his wife, Becca Butcher, who died in Season 2. Not only that, but she now serves as his conscience, urging him to not betray Hughie and to try to save Ryan from Homelander.\n\nThe reason for this seems clear: Butcher has a massive brain tumor and only about six months left to live. Worse, the tumor is terminal. Butcher's desperately trying to soldier on, but he's lost control of his life and the trust of his soldiers. When he sees Ryan by chance, he risks the mission (which would've failed anyway) to try to save him instead. Homelander confronts him, revealing the tumor to Ryan and the audience. Butcher is blamed for blowing the mission, leading to even less confidence in his abilities and competence. Only Hughie wants him around, and now with his dad in a coma after a stroke, no one on the team is willing to push back on what he wants -- even if they could barely stand being in the same room as Butcher. Left with no one at his side, Butcher meets the mysterious CIA Agent Jonathan Kessler after he's left out of the meeting between Grace and President-Elect Singer.\n\nKessler and Butcher have history. If Becca is the angel on Butcher's shoulder, Kessler is the devil. He's encouraging Butcher to kill Homelander, which Butcher agrees with. He knows there is a countdown clock ticking off in his head, and he tells Kessler he wants to do it before Homelander starts \"putting people in camps.\" The only thing more important to Butcher avenging himself before his death was stopping Homelander from becoming the monster he can't wait to become. Kessler and Butcher seem to agree to work together to kill Homelander, which is why Butcher considered betraying Hughie in the first place. Yet, this is one of the rare times that Butcher does the right thing.\n\nTwo Supes Are Crucial to The Boys Season 4's Larger Story\n\nSister Sage and Ryan Are the Only People Homelander Respects\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nHow The Boys Season 4 Can Change Homelander And Not For the Better\n\nHomelander has been held back for three seasons so far, but leading into season 4, he is on track to be the most dangerous version of Homelander yet.\n\nWhile Homelander is The Boys Season 4's central superpowered character, the season seems to hang on two others: Sister Sage and Ryan. Because the Seven is short of a few members, Homelander picks Sage as one of 25 potential appointees. Homelander believes he's a genius, blaming his inadequacy in controlling his trial's narrative, the media's perception of him and Vought as a corporation on those around him. If he's truly willing to listen to Sage, she could seemingly create a plan to deliver the world to him. That being said, she may also have her own plans because, as their meeting proves, she can read Homelander like a comic book.\n\nHowever, Ryan is crucial to Season 4's story, too. When Butcher first confronts him, it's revealed that Ryan believes the lies about the man his father killed. Homelander is currently teaching Ryan that \"humans\" are merely \"toys for [supes'] amusement.\" Slowly but surely, Ryan is being corrupted and remade into Homelander's image. But while Ryan lacks respect for the lives of literally powerless strangers, he has empathy for Butcher, the man his mother loved. As evil as he is, Homelander is desperate to be the \"good\" father to Ryan that Soldier Boy wasn't for him. This, naturally, manifests in some odd and disturbing ways that Homelander himself doesn't realize. If Sage's plans turn Ryan against him, Homelander may choose his son over her.\n\nEach season of The Boys may only run eight episodes, but a lot happens in each episode. As such, the Season 4 premiere was full of narrative and character developments. The characters' dynamics and the overall status quo drastically changed, but the overall mission hasn't. For one, the Boys are in the best place they've ever been to effect some change in a world of totalitarian superheroes and the looming threat of fascism. The ending of the premiere episode is, at least by The Boys' standards, hopeful. The team is getting closer, save for Butcher. However, with the end of his life staring him down, Butcher may be weighing the value of his own relationships against the mission for the first time in his life. How he will balance his desire for redemption and fulfilling the mission at hand will be something fans will definitely keep an eye out for.\n\nThe Boys debuts new episodes Thursdays on Prime Video.\n\nThe Boys\n\nTV-MA\n\nAction\n\nCrime\n\nDrama\n\nSuperhero\n\n9\n\n10\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019\n\nCast Karl Urban , Karen Fukuhara , Jack Quaid , Erin Moriarty\n\nMain Genre Action\n\nSeasons 4\n\nFranchise The Boys\n\nCreator Eric Kripke\n\nProduction Company Kripke Enterprises, Amazon MGM Studios, Sony Pictures Television\n\nPros Homelander's trial and media blitz perfectly mirrors the modern day political world.

There's not quite enough new superheroes or characters in the first episode.\n\nExpand", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_m_patton@cbr.com", "name": "Joshua M.

From the sound of it, this new batch of episodes isn't going to be kind to The Seven's heroic do-gooder, Annie January, a.k.a. Starlight.\n\nAfter a fantastic run on Prime Video, The Boys is approaching the finish line, with creator Eric Kripke taking to social media earlier this week to confirm that the series will be ending with its fifth and final season -- just days before the release of season 4. While most agree that this is the perfect end point for a show like The Boys, it's still going to be sad to say goodbye to this absolute gore-fest of a TV masterpiece, and it means that the bar for season 4 just got a whole lot higher.\n\nBased on early trailers, the upcoming season of The Boys will see Homelander (Antony Starr) campaigning for vice presidential candidate (and secret \"supe\") Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit). Meanwhile, time is running out for his nemesis, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), who willingly injected Compound V into his veins, thus shortening his lifespan. To finally defeat Homelander and bring an end to Vought's rein, Butcher will have to (begrudgingly) set aside his ego and place his trust in his team.\n\nMost, if not all of the original cast is returning for season 4 of The Boys, including Jack Quaid (Hughie Campbell), Laz Alonso (Mother's Milk), Karen Fukuhara (Kimiko Miyashiro/The Female), Tomer Capone (Frenchie), Jessie T. Usher (A-Train), Chace Crawford (The Deep), Cameron Crovetti (Ryan), and Colby Minifie (Ashley Barrett). Given that this will act as the penultimate season, it's safe to assume that the new batch of episodes will serve as setup for future installments, though we have yet to hear any word on when we can expect season 5 to debut.\n\nAlthough the fourth season of The Boys seems to be placing a particular emphasis on Homelander and Butcher's longstanding feud, it looks like there's trouble ahead for someone else: Erin Moriarty's Annie January, who appears to have some sort of beef with newcomer Firecracker (Valorie Curry).\n\nStarlight has always been suspect No. 1 of Homelander since joining The Seven, but she's certainly made herself even more of a target now that she's jumped ship and sided with \"The Boys.\" Oh, and she also put Homelander on blast following the events of Herogasm, but I digress. Either way, her whole girl-next-door vibe tends to rub Homelander (and Butcher, for that matter) the wrong way. Even her allies are skeptical about her loyalties because of her superhuman abilities, and her ill-fated romance with Hughie only complicates things.\n\nStill, Annie has made her dedication to The Boys clear, as she understands just how dangerous Homelander really is. However, Moriarty recently told Comicbook.com that it's never been her intention to portray a \"perfect\" character, saying, \"I love that they keep adding these flaws and vulnerabilities to a character that ultimately, in my mind, make her more endearing, more appealing to play, more appealing to watch.\" And yeah, it looks like season 4 is about to make Starlight look a whole lot worse, as the new episodes will explore her dark side as a former bully.\n\nYes, wildly enough, even \"The Defender of Des Moines\" wasn't immune to some petty behavior in her youth, as Moriarty spilled in the same interview that her character used to bully Firecracker. \"I have a moment with Firecracker where she reveals a part of my past where I was a bully,\" the actress revealed, adding, \"I love that moment. Because that, to me, is the most unambiguous malicious moment. We've seen her exemplify -- everything else has been with a good intention. I love that they add those little bits.\"\n\nMoral ambiguity is at the heart of The Boys, and this unsavory part of Starlight's past could come back to haunt her now that Firecracker is the newest recruit of The Seven. Yeah, don't be fooled by that thick Southern drawl, because Firecracker is (literally) locked and loaded, and she's prepared to gun down anyone who dares get in her way. From the looks of it, she also has a weird, pseudo romance thing with Homelander, so we'll just have to see how that plays out. Probably, like, not great?\n\nWith the upcoming season of The Boys set to explore more of Starlight's childhood -- including her strained relationship with her mother, Donna (Ann Cusack) -- audiences might be a little less sympathetic toward Annie January this time around. All will be revealed when The Boys season 4 premieres Prime Video tomorrow, June 13, at 3AM ET/12AM PT.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_landwehr@themarysue.com", "name": "Amanda Landwehr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

Releasing today, on June 13, 2024, with 3 episodes on Prime Video, this new season is expected to introduce new Supes, intense violence and the return of one of the most terrifying villains we have seen. The third season of the series has already given us a number of cliffhangers and suspense-worthy moments that we desperately need closures for. Apart from its previous season that aired in 2022, another spin-off series, titled Gen V also connected some of the dots and gave the franchise fans more reasons to look forward to The Boys season 4.\n\nBefore you start binging on the new season, here's a rundown of what happened by the end of the third season:\n\nHomelander's unchecked power\n\nHomelander seemed pretty dangerous ever since its introduction in the drama series. During the first two seasons, he tries to maintain a heroic image. However, in Season 3, he abandons this pretence. Starlight exposed him in Episodes 6 and 8 and Homelander tried to spread conspiracies about her in revenge. He also learns that Soldier Boy is his father which makes him angrier. By the end of the 3rd season, he persuades his son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) to join him. In the final scene, Ryan's smile also hints that he might be willing to follow his father's destructive path in season 4.\n\nVictoria Neuman's Rise\n\nSeason 2 introduced Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), a young politician against Vought. By season 3, she became a key antagonist with head-popping powers. In episode 7, she offered to help Homelander find Ryan in exchange for killing her rival. Her daughter Zoe (Olivia Morandin) has been injected with Compound V and is expected to have a bigger role in season 4. The new trailer also shows Zoe with tentacles coming from her mouth.\n\nMajor injuries & deaths\n\nBy the end of season 3, Black Noir gets killed by Homelander. However, despite his death, Black Noir can be spotted in the season 4 teaser trailer. Queen Maeve has already sacrificed herself to save New York City from Soldier Boy's blast, but she survives, losing her powers and an eye. Her survival also makes it probable that she will return in this season. Meanwhile, Soldier Boy is put back into cryogenic slumber, guarded by Grace Mallory (Laila Robins). It also hints at a future comeback.\n\nNew members and crossovers\n\nThe Seven now has Homelander, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) and The Deep (Chace Crawford). Season 4 introduces new members Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) and Firecracker (Valorie Curry). Sister Sage, the first Black woman in The Seven, has superhuman intelligence.\n\nThe season 4 trailer also shows characters from spin-off Gen V, especially Cate Dunlap and Sam Riordan (Asa Germann). Cate controls others by touch and Sam has super strength and durability.\n\nButcher's health crisis\n\nIn the season 3 finale, Butcher got to know that Temp V is damaging his brain. It has left him only with about 12-18 months to live. He still continues using Temp V to fight Homelander and his condition is still hidden from The Boys.\n\nStarlight Joins the Boys\n\nStarlight tried to reform Vought from within, became a double agent and eventually left The Seven in Season 3. After exposing Homelander and Vought, she and Hughie reconciled by the season's end. She has also gained acceptance into the group and has officially joined The Boys.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cliffhanger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

But, before you get all excited and run to Prime Video, let's make sure you're up to date on everything that happened in Season 3.\n\nIn Season 3, the show takes place a year after Season 2 events. \"The Boys\" took up help from Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) in order to conquer Homelander. Homelander reached his breaking point after Soldier Boy disowned him as his son. Plus, Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) and Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) are high off the deadly Compound V modification Temporary V -- and one of them only has a few months of life left because of it.\n\nAll right, enough waiting. Here's everything you need from Season 3 of \"The Boys\" to get you ready for Season 4.\n\nNote: This post contains spoilery plot details from previous seasons of \"The Boys\" and \"Gen V.\"\n\nAs if Homelander couldn't be any more unhinged, in Season 3 The Seven leader's anger, hostility and fragile ego were let completely off the chain. There's really no one who can level him out, except for maybe his biological son Ryan, whom he's taken from under his care from Billy Butcher. For the first part of the season, Homelander kept a low profile, fearful of Queen Maeve's damaging footage of him crashing a plane full of people going public, on top of people finding out that he dated neo-nazi supe Stormfront.\n\nHowever, at one point, he releases himself from caring about what others think and goes on a full-on rant about how much \"better\" he is than any other Super, and especially regular humans.\n\n\"I don't make mistakes. I'm not just like the rest of you -- I'm stronger, I'm smarter, I'm better!\" Homelander exclaims. His rant boosted his likability among audiences, helping him earn his No. 1 spot back after Starlight had toppled over him in ranking.\n\nIn Season 3 Episode 7, Homelander learned Soldier Boy is his father after The Payback leader filled him in via a phone call, during which Soldier Boy convinced Homelander to meet him so the two could talk. In reality, it was just a ploy put together to lure Homelander in The Boys' attack. Later on, Homelander tried to talk Soldier Boy into joining forces with him and Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) to be a family, but Soldier Boy shut him down.\n\n\"It's a shame that I've missed so much,\" Soldier Boy says to Homelander. \"I wish I could have raised you and taught you, father to son. Maybe if I'd raised you, I could have made you better, and not some weak, sniveling p -- y starved for attention. But there's no fixing that now ... You're a f -- g disappointment.\"\n\nIn the finale episode, Homelander's fully sets into his villain era when he lasers off a Starlight follower's head for throwing an object at his son Ryan. Homelander's murderous move ended up being applauded by his fans, giving Homelander all the support he needed to carry on with his sinister behavior.\n\nIn an effort to move closer to killing Homelander, Butcher decides to get his own super strength by taking a deadly version of Compound V, Temp V (or V24), which he knows will kill him after three to five doses. Butcher has gone past his limit, having taken up to six doses, which has developed several tumors in his brain. He now only has 18 months to live.\n\nStarlight (Erin Moriarty) sweet girl from Des Moines, Iowa, who had dreams of one day joining the great superhero team The Seven, literally trashed her Starlight suit and joined the ranks of The Boys. The entire crew is happy about it despite Butcher's skepticism.\n\nIn Season 3, Hughie was going through the motions and a bit all over the place. Insecure over the fact that his superhuman girlfriend Starlight always saves his life, he sneakily takes Temp V (ignoring Butcher's urge against it) to build up his confidence and to prepare himself for The Boys' takedown of Homelander.\n\nIn the Season 3 finale, right after Starlight ditches her Starlight suit, the group learns from a news report that Robert \"Dakota Bob\" (Jim Beaver) has selected undercover Supe Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) as his Vice President running mate.\n\n\"As the next vice president, I will work hard to provide a safe and secure future for all citizens on both sides of the political divide,\" Victoria says.\n\n\"And that's why I am so proud to have her on my team,\" Bob chimes in.\n\nThis development puts her even closer to her goal of making it into the White House, though her true intentions haven't quite been revealed. In \"Gen V,\" Neuman is head of the Federal Bureau of Superhuman Affairs (FBSA), which seeks to regulate Supe activity. She's also the only person who is possession of a Supe-killing virus created by scientist Dr. Edison Cardosa (Marco Pigossi). In Season 3, fans learn Victoria is the adopted daughter of Vought International CEO, who he took in from the Vought-operated orphanage Red River Institute.\n\nThe one person Homelander can't strike fear into is Vought International CEO Stan Edgar. But in Season 3, Victoria Neuman pairs up with Homelander to sell her adoptive father out after years of helping him do his dirty work. Ultimately, Stan took a temporary leave from his position. Before getting the boot, Edgar revealed his plans to have Compound V legalized so it can be used to turn everyday humans into powerful beings for 24 hours.\n\nMoving on, let's get into who all got murked, or just so happened to escape, in Season 3.\n\nBlack Noir\n\nHomelander murdered Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) for not telling him Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) is his father. However, a different version of Black Noir makes an appearance in the Season 4 trailer. \"The Boys\" showrunner and executive producer Kripke said Black Noir actor Nathan Mitchell will return to the series as a \"different character who wears a Black Noir suit.\"\n\nStormfront\n\nIn Season 3 Episode 2, Homelander's neo-Nazi boo Stormfront (Aya Cash) took her own life once she realized her goal to create a \"master race\" of Supes that doesn't include POCs or members of the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nSupersonic\n\nHomelander brutally beat and lasered Starlight's/Annie's ex-boyfriend Supersonic to death after A-Train filled Homelander in about Starlight and Supersonic's plot to bring A-Train over to their side to take Homelander down. As a warning to Starlight, he called her to the top of a building where he showed her a bloodied and lifeless Supersonic.\n\nQueen Maeve\n\nThe beloved Queen Maeve/Margaret Shaw (Dominique McElligott) didn't die, but it was a close call. In the Season 3 finale, she put her life on the line to save New York City by taking on a deathly power blast from Soldier Boy. While Maeve kept her life, she lost and eye and her powers. Fans likely won't see Maeve for a bit of time as left the city and strolled off into happiness with her girlfriend Elena (Nicola Correia-Damude).\n\nThe Godolkin University-set spinoff \"Gen V\" served \"The Boys\" lovers with another dose of Vought goodness while also setting up show-colliding tips and future storylines for watchers to look forward to.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened in the season finale of \"Gen V.\" During the middle of the credits, the show cut to a scene where Billy the Butcher is lurking through the halls of God U's secret lab, The Woods, revealing that \"The Boys\" character knows about the Supe-killing virus God U dean Indira Shetty (Shelley Conn) and Dr. Edison (Marco Pigossi) developed before they died.\n\n\"The Boys\" creator Eric Kripke previously told TheWrap that it was his idea to have Butcher be the connection between \"The Boys\" and the Supe-killing virus introduced in \"Gen V.\"\n\n\"We were pretty deep into the Season 4 break by the time we were around [the 'Gen V'] finale, and we sort of knew how we were picking up the ball,\" Kripke explained. \"We talked about, 'Well, we should start the first step of that story' -- it's only a mild spoiler to say that, because it's obvious, based on the ['Gen V'] finale, but when Butcher is in Season 4 of 'The Boys,' he's very aware of this virus, and we knew that we were writing to it. Then the question came up of like, 'Well, how is he aware, and when did he find out about it?' We started saying, 'Well, let's actually show [viewers] when it's really happening, which is over the course of 'Gen V.' So it came pretty organically out of that.\"\n\n\"Gen V\" Supes Maddie Phillips (Cate Dunlap) and Sam (Asa Germann) will likely become Homelander's proteges, as the end of \"Gen V\" showed the two's characters have taken on a \"Supes vs. everyone else\" mentality that Homelander could use to his advantage.\n\nIn \"The Boys\" Season 3 finale, titled \"The Instant White-Hot Wild,\" Homelander picked up his biological son, Ryan, to take him under his wing for good. While that was happening, tensions between Homelander's supporters and Starlight believers steadily grew, Kimiko got her power back with an injection of Compound V and Homelander murdered Black Noir for not telling him Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) is his father. As Episode 8 began to come to a close, the crew united to take Homelander down.\n\nAfter Butcher successfully lured Homelander in with the help of Soldier Boy, the father and son supes broke out into a massive brawl. Soldier Boy shared some choice words with Homelander, and more or less called him a failure.\n\nTo protect Ryan from Soldier Boy's fatal explosion, Butcher shot Soldier Boy with a laser beam -- which was against Butcher's previous code of conduct in their plan to kill Homelander. Butcher's move set off a fight between the two, and left Maeve to handle Homelander on her own. The Seven members' match resulted in Maeve losing an eye. Once the showdowns concluded, Homelander took off with Ryan.\n\nHomelander finished off the season when he flew down into a crowd of his supporters to introduce them to Ryan. But a Starlight follower interrupted his announcement by throwing a can that hit Ryan in the face. In true Homelander form, he responded with violence and laser beamed the man's face off. To Homelander's surprise, the crowd loved it, and so did Ryan. They both closed out the show with smirks across their faces, signifying that Ryan may be more like his father than fans think.\n\n\"The Boys\" Season 4 landed on Prime Video Thursday, June 13 with three episodes. Episodes will air weekly after its debut.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raquel_rocky_harris@thewrap.com", "name": "Raquel Rocky

However, superheroes in this universe aren't as great as they're cracked up to be -- in fact, they're quite terrible people.\n\n[ The Boys Season 4 Release Date Breaks a Frustrating Series Record ]\n\nThe Cast, Characters, and Actors of The Boys Season 4\n\nAntony Starr - Homelander\n\nThe infamous Homelander leads the show, brought to life by the incredibly talented Antony Starr. Imagine an evil version of Superman, and that should give a good idea of what he can do.\n\nFollowing the events of Season 3, where he brutally slaughtered a protester in front of everyone, Homelander is now forced to juggle the pressure of being on trial in front of the world while also raising his son, Ryan. It's not an easy status quo to juggle.\n\nKarl Urban plays Butcher, the founder of The Boys, who, after using too much Temp V, finds his time on this Earth quickly counting down. To make matters worse, most of his former team despises him for everything he's done up through the first three seasons.\n\nButcher's biggest goal in Season 4 is finding some way to get Ryan away from Homelander before the youngster turns out like his homicidal father. This outcome could potentially signal the end of the world.\n\nHughie Campbell, played by Jack Quaid, has come a long way since Season 1. Now, he's a key member of The Boys, and he's the only reason Butcher hasn't been thrown out yet.\n\nSeason 4 will see Hughie continue to struggle with the idea that he is one of the most useful members of the team, as well as dealing with his dad's sudden medical issues.\n\nAt the end of The Boys Season 3, Erin Moriarty's Starlight quit Vought and The Seven to publicly oppose Homelander during his murder trial. She is now a full-fledged member of The Boys, going by the name Annie and having retired her fancy super suit.\n\nStarlight has the ability to take in nearby electrical energy to create blinding lights.\n\nA-Train, played by Jessie T. Usher, grows tired from his life at Vought and is always being pushed and pulled around by Homelander. Despite that, he remains a reluctant member of The Seven.\n\nHis power is super-speed, which almost killed him due to the heart problems he suffered in Season 3.\n\nWith Butcher out as leader, Laz Alonso's Mother's Milk (MM) is now team captain for The Boys. He also has zero patience for Butcher in Season 4 and wants Urban's character off the team.\n\nMM also works directly with the FBI and the United States government to try to take down Victoria Neuman.\n\nChance Crawford's The Deep is a deeply troubled supe with a laundry list of past sins. While he is a pathetic character all the way around, he somehow managed to land his spot back in The Seven.\n\nHe has the ability to communicate with sealife and has increased speed and agility in the water.\n\nTomer Capone plays Frenchie, an original member of The Boys who is always working to outrun his questionable past. Of all his teammates, he's grown closest to Kimiko -- though the two aren't in a relationship.\n\nSeason 4 sees Frenchie getting involved with a new guy with whom he has complicated ties.\n\nKaren Fukuhara's Kimiko Miyashiro has come a long way since Season 1 of The Boys. While she still can't communicate vocally, Kimiko continues to work on her verbal skills on top of her usual signing.\n\nThanks to Anne joining the team, Kimiko is no longer the only member of The Boys with superpowers.\n\nAshley Barrett's life is far from easy, and Colby Minifie's frantic, panicked Vought CEO is balding because of it. Somehow, she hasn't gone crazy yet, but perhaps that'll change in Season 4.\n\nGrace Mallory, played by Laila Robins, is the original founder of The Boys. She's always trying to pull the strings behind the scenes, doing her best to be one step ahead of everyone -- though she admittedly falls short on occasion.\n\nMallory enjoyed a brief cameo near the end of Gen V Season 1.\n\nRobins also portrayed Pamela Milton, the leader of the Commonwealth Community, in The Walking Dead.\n\nClaudia Doumit's Victoria Neuman is one of the main antagonists of Season 4, who finds herself running for Vice President of the United States. She's secretly a supe who can explode people's heads, but the wider world does not know that.\n\nNeuman appeared in Gen V where she successfully got her hands on the deadly supe virus, though it remains unclear how she plans on using it.\n\nCameron Crovetti's Ryan is the biological son of Homelander and Becca (Butcher's late wife), who inherited his father's superpowers.\n\nWhile the child is currently aligned with Homelander, Butcher hopes he can find a way to pull him out of the psychopath's Influence.\n\nJim Beaver's Robert Singer is Victoria Neuman's running mate who is running to be President of the United States.\n\nSimon Pegg embodies Hugh Campbell, Hughie's sweet and innocent dad. Season 4 sees Hugh struck with sudden medical issues, which brings the Campbell family together in unexpected ways\n\nSusan Heyward's Sister Sage utilizes a superpower that makes her the smartest person in the world, which leads Homelander to personally recruit her to fill an empty spot in The Seven.\n\nSage has very little interest in holding her tongue, and she'll say whatever she's thinking whenever she wants to -- a quality one would think might trigger Homelander.\n\nValorie Curry is Firecracker, another new face brought in to fill an empty spot in The Seven. Before joining the team, she was known for running a conspiracy theorist show, riling up Homelander supporters with fake stories about the Deep State.\n\nAs her name suggests, she can shoot off firecrackers from her fingers. She also carries a pistol on her.\n\nFresh off his time in Gen V, where he was nearly killed by rouge supes, P.J. Byrne's Adam Bourke is back creating his hammy superhero movies and shows that audiences know him for.\n\nJeffery Dean Morgan is Joe Kessler, a mysterious former acquaintance of Billy Butcher who finds himself crossing paths once again with The Boys' ex-leader.\n\nWhile The Boys fandom is familiar with Simon Pegg's Hugh Campbell, Season 4 will introduce Rosemarie DeWitt's Daphne Campbell -- Hughie's long-lost mother, whom he hasn't heard from since he was six.\n\nSeth Reed, played by Malcolm Barrett, is a public relations writer for Vought who helps figure out how to weave their narrative to the public.\n\nElliot Knight's Colin is the new love interest for Tomer Capone's Frenchie, who, unbeknownst to him, shares a complicated connection with The Boys member.\n\nCate Dunlap, played by Maddie Phillips, will return in The Boys Season 4. First seen in Gen V, he has the power of suggestion, allowing her to make people do what she wants after touching them with her bare skin.\n\nFollowing her attack on Godolkin University, she lost her arm before being saved by Homelander himself.\n\nAsa Germann's Sam Riordan hails from the Amazon Studios spin-off series Gen V, where he teamed with Cate Dunlap to cause mayhem and carnage against the humans of Godolkin University.\n\nHis powers give him extreme super strength and resistance, with the extra caveat of Sam being a little crazy.\n\nThe last time audiences saw him, he had just shut off his emotions thanks to Cate's help.\n\nMatthew Gorman's Todd is a former father figure to Mother Milk's daughter, who is a deep fan of Homelander.

Following the shocking events of Season 3, Homelander is ready for Supes to outgrow their human overlords at Vought and become \"vengeful gods\" over modern society. That's not gonna fly with Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his band of Supe exposers, who will need to pull every dirty play in the book if they want to stop a Homelander regime from forming.\n\nThe large cast of The Boys is expanding once again with Season 4. Not only will new radical Supes be joining The \"Most Mighty\" Seven, but a cast member from showrunner Eric Kripke's other hit show, Supernatural, is also joining the fray this time around. To find out who will be joining this superhero battle royale for what we now know is the penultimate season of The Boys, here is our complete cast and character guide for The Boys Season 4.\n\nThe Boys\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Main Genre Superhero Seasons 4 Karl Urban Billy Butcher Close\n\nThe original foul-mouthed curmudgeon of The Boys, Karl Urban returns as the foul-mouthed Supe-hater, Billy Butcher. Easily one of Karl Urban's best and most beloved roles, he's also appeared in other hits like The Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Dredd, and more. Urban is also set to join the Mortal Kombat universe in the upcoming sequel, playing the fan-favorite narcissist, Johnny Cage.\n\nBilly Butcher had everything taken from him when his wife, Becca (Shantel VanSanten), disappeared. Believing Homelander to be responsible for Becca's disappearance, Butcher dedicates his life to exposing Vought's many superheroes as genuine monsters. This leads to Butcher leaving his job at the CIA to go freelance, recruiting a ragtag team to try and expose Homelander and his cronies once and for all. Butcher has long-held a deep prejudice towards all superpowered beings, though over the course of the series, he's started to make some exceptions.\n\nSeason 3 sees Billy decide that the best way to fight fire is with fire, and he uses an experimental drug called Temp V, which gives him temporary superpowers that are virtually identical to that of Homelander. Unfortunately, Billy's prolonged use of the drug leads to some unexpected side effects, and Billy is given a terminal diagnosis. Now working against the clock, Billy is more determined than ever to stop Homelander's reign of terror.\n\nAntony Starr Homelander Close\n\nThe worst of the worst when it comes to corrupt superheroes, Homelander has become one of television's most infamous villains. Once again, Antony Starr will bring the character's villainous charm and vile tendencies to life for Season 4.\n\nA clear parody of both Superman and Captain America, Homelander looks like a bona fide \"Man of Steel with a Plan\", with powers like flight, laser eyes, and virtual invincibility to boot. That's all a facade, as in actuality, Homelander is a homicidal man-child who was created from a test tube using Soldier Boy's (Jensen Ackles) DNA. Being the most famous superhero on Earth, Homelander was once willing to do anything to keep his public image as a noble hero in tact, even if it means slaughtering thousands.\n\nHomelander completely abandons the act in Season 3, and he slowly starts to reveal his true colors to the world. Starting with a rant about how he's superior of live-television, Homelander takes things even further when he publicly executes a protestor at a rally. What's even scarier than a beloved hero murdering an innocent person in broad daylight? The fact that Homelander's supporters condone and even celebrate his wanton act of cruelty.\n\nJack Quaid Hughie Campbell\n\nJack Quaid returns as Hughie Campbell for Season 4 to be the goodhearted foil to the pessimistic Billy Butcher. Coincidentally enough, Jack Quaid also plays the exact opposite of Homelander in another superhero show, My Adventures with Superman.\n\nHughie didn't ask to join a Cold War between humans and Supes, but found himself inadvertently joining the fight when his then-girlfriend, Robin (Jess Salgueiro), is accidentally killed by A-Train (Jessie T. Usher). After he reluctantly starts working with Butcher, Hughie finds a second chance at love with The Seven's newest and uncharacteristically noble hero, Starlight (Erin Moriarty). Hughie also got roped in with Butcher's Temp V addiction in Season 3, giving him superhuman speed. He's able to overcome his addiction thanks to Starlight, but hopefully he won't experience that terminal side effects that have taken hold of Butcher.\n\nErin Moriarty Starlight\n\nOne of the few \"good\" superheroes that exists in The Boys universe, Erin Moriarty returns to the role of Starlight. She has plenty of experience with politically charged and culturally relevant superhero stories, as Moriarty also starred in Marvel and Netflix's Jessica Jones series.\n\nSince discovering her powers at a young age (which, like all superheroes in The Boys, were provided by Vought through scientific experiments), Annie January always wanted to be a superhero and join The Seven. Her ability to control light made her an ideal candidate for the group, but Starlight learns very quickly this corporate entity is not the altruistic organization it appears to be. After meeting Hughie and his companions, Starlight becomes something of a double agent within The Seven, but after becoming much more vocal about Homelander's crimes, she's been ousted from the superhero team. This is what also makes her a target of the radical heroes like Firecracker (Valorie Curry) in Season 4.\n\nJessie T. Usher A-Train\n\nOne of the more complicated \"heroes\" in The Boys is A-Train, played by Smile star Jessie T. Usher.\n\nA-Train has committed many crimes in The Boys, being the accidental murderer of Hughie's girlfriend Robin and the deliberate murderer of his own girlfriend Popclaw (Brittany Allen). However, unlike the other villains of the show, A-Train isn't motivated by greed or avarice - he's motivated by fear. A-Train is so deathly afraid of what Homelander will do to him should he step out of line that he'll do anything to stay in his favor. That being said, A-Train is also clearly on a redemption arc, with him truly starting to question to morals behind his actions.\n\nChace Crawford The Deep\n\nThe third and final original member of The Seven (at least in terms of Season 1), Gossip Girl star Chace Crawford returns as the misogynistic Aquaman parody, The Deep.\n\nThe Deep is essentially A-Train but without a moral compass. Within minutes of meeting him, The Deep commits a heinous act of sexual violence against Starlight. He's almost immediately taken down a peg, even being briefly kicked out of The Seven and joining a Fresca-loving cult. He's been brought back into the fold now, and after some psychological torturing by Homelander, he has become another spineless follower in Homelander's grand plan.\n\nNathan Mitchell Black Noir II\n\nAnother character that is (sort of) returning for Season 4 is Black Noir. The masked murderer is once again portrayed by Nathan Mitchell, but the character is technically brand-new.\n\nThe original Black Noir was one of Vought's most loyal assassins, taking care of any of the company's dirty deeds that need doing. However, a rare conflict of interest appears when Noir's old teammate Soldier Boy returns in Season 3, and Black Noir vows to murder him for the abuse he received at his hands. Homelander doesn't take kindly to the only person he could consider a friend wanting to kill his father, so Homelander wastes no time murdering Noir. Who this new Black Noir in Season 4 is remains a mystery.\n\nTomer Capone Frenchie\n\nThe Boys' resident tech and weapons expert, Fauda star Tomer Capone returns as Frenchie.\n\nAfter recruiting Hughie in his Super hunting game, one of the first people Butcher reunites with is Frenchie. A neurotic frenchman connected to the criminal underworld, Frenchie is a technical genius who is constantly thinking of ways to kill powerful Supes. That doesn't mean he has vitriolic hatred for all Supes, as he forms an incredibly close relationship with fellow teammate Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara).\n\nLaz Alonso Mother's Milk\n\nAhead of the actor's surprising return to the Avatar universe, Laz Alonso will also be returning to the world of The Boys as Mother's Milk (more commonly known as MM).\n\nMother's Milk's name might be odd, but he's very much the mom of the group. While he has his own personal vendettas from time to time, MM places the safety of his companions above everything else. However, even above that, MM also is deeply concerned about the well-being of his daughter, especially now that her new stepfather is a Homelander sympathizer.\n\nKaren Fukuhara Kimiko Miyashiro\n\nThe final official member of the titular Boys, Suicide Squad and Bullet Train star Karen Fukuhara returns to her fan favorite role of Kimiko Miyashiro.\n\nMany of the characters in The Boys have experienced their fair share of trauma, but Kimiko's journey is among some of the most tragic. During Vought's initiative to create Supe terrorists to give their heroes some more entertaining opponents, Kimiko and her brother (Abraham Lim) were ripped from their homes and given superpowers. It takes some time for Kimiko to form a bond with The Boys, but with the help of Frenchie, she eventually learns how to use her superhuman strength for good.\n\nColby Minifie Ashley Barrett\n\nColby Minifie, star of Fear the Walking Dead, plays the CEO of Vought in The Boys, though she's really a CEO in name only.\n\nAshley Barrett started out as the personal assistant of former Vought executive, Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue). When Stillwell was killed and former CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) was ousted, Barett was put in charge of the company, but she's a patsy in every sense of the word. She might act like a hotshot executive to her fellow humans, but she is just as scared of Homelander as everyone else.\n\nClaudia Doumit Victoria Neuman\n\nWhere'd You Go, Bernadette star Claudia Doumit returns as Victoria Neuman - the corrupt politician who seems to be making a play for the White House.\n\nWhen she's first introduced, Neuman appears to be a benevolent senator who wants to hold Supes accountable for their actions. In actuality, Neuman is a Super herself, and a very powerful one at that. Gen V confirmed that her powers are very similar to that of Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), with her blood-bending powers being capable of exploding the heads of up to dozens of people.\n\nCameron Rovetti Ryan\n\nA character fans are very nervous about in Season 4 is Ryan, played by Big Little Lies star Cameron Rovetti.\n\nRyan is the young son of Homelander and Becca, and he inherited his dad's powers but not his natural propensity for violence. When he first meets his dad in Season 2, Ryan is deathly afraid of his father, and to an extent even himself after Ryan accidentally kills his mother with his own laser vision. In Season 3, though, Ryan is rejected by Butcher and pushed toward Homelander, and the way he smiles as Homelander kills civilians does not inspire confidence.\n\nNew Cast Members in 'The Boys' Season 4 Close\n\nA number of new cast members are joining The Boys Season 4, starting with a beloved Supernatural alum, Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Details around his role are shrouded in secrecy, but it seems apparent that he'll be playing an old frenemy from Butcher's past who wants to help put the impending Supe regime down. Also in the mix are two new members of The Seven, those being Valorie Curry (Blair Witch) as Firecracker and Susan Heyward (Orange is the New Black) as Sister Sage.\n\nThe Boys Season 4 is now streaming on Prime Video.\n\nWatch on Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

The fractured parts of Homelander's psyche speak to him during the episode's ending, encouring him to go \" home .\" Judging by the flashbacks he has, Homelander will return to the Vought lab he was created in future episodes of The Boys.\n\nThe Boys season 4 debuted on Prime Video with three episodes, and the ending of episode 3 sets the stage for further exploration of Homelander's (Antony Starr) past. Homelander has a rough time in \"We'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here,\" as he discovers there's a traitor at Vought and catches Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) sneaking out to visit Butcher (Karl Urban). The latter hits him particularly hard, dredging up his deep-seated insecurities. His anger leads him to lash out at Ryan, but it also pushes him to reflect on his own humanity.\n\nLooking in the mirror, Homelander faces the fractured parts of his psyche, which reveal just how human The Seven's leader is. He mostly condemns himself for this, wishing to be a beacon of strength rather than a vulnerable person. While part of him considers fixing things with Ryan, the others accuse him of being \"weak\" for desiring love. Homelander decides he must eliminate his vulnerabilities by going \"back to the start.\" This may leave viewers wondering where he's headed. Fortunately, his flashbacks at the end of episode 3 offer a clue.\n\nRelated The Boys: 25 Differences Between The Comics & The Show\n\nThe Amazon superhero series The Boys is based on a comic book series of the same name. Some things were changed comparing the comic book vs. show.\n\nHomelander Is Returning To The Vought Lab He Was Created In This Is The \"Home\" His Reflections Speak Of In Episode 3\n\nHomelander's reflections tell him to go back to the beginning in The Boys season 4, episode 3, and the episode's ending teases the Supe going \"home.\" This may confuse viewers, as Vought Tower is Homelander's residence -- and it has been since the Amazon series started. However, Homelander's fight with Ryan brings up baggage from his own childhood. When his reflections speak of home, they're talking about the Vought lab Homelander was created in. The Supe's flashbacks to a cold, sterile environment confirm as much.\n\nWhen his reflections speak of home, they're talking about the Vought lab Homelander was created in.\n\nWith that in mind, the ending of The Boys season 4, episode 3 sets the stage for Homelander to return to his place of origin in episode 4. It's unclear what his goal in going there is, but he believes it's the best way to rid himself of his humanity. Perhaps facing his parentage and upbringing will help him break the bond he feels with Ryan. Homelander's desire to have a relationship with his son stems from his lack of a father. It also comes from his need for love, which was denied when he was growing up.\n\nBreaking Down Homelander's Flashbacks At The End Of The Boys Season 4, Episode 3 The Brief Shots Of Vought's Lab Show A Cold & Sterile Environment\n\nAs Homelander decides to return \"home\" in The Boys season 4, episode 3, he has several flashbacks to his time in Vought's lab. One shows an ominous red door, while others depict tools like scalpels and torches. There's also a brief shot of a woman, though there's no clarification of who she is. Viewers can assume she played a prominent role in Homelander's upbringing, and he could confront her about it when he returns. The other shots suggest Homelander was experimented on as a child. The images of the lab are cold and sterile, highlighting the lack of love and warmth he felt growing up.\n\nHis flashbacks in episode 3 and promise to return to Vought's lab suggest The Boys will take a more direct approach to exploring his childhood in season 4.\n\nThe Boys will expand on this further in future episodes, but those familiar with the comics already know the dark truth of how Homelander was experimented on growing up. The Amazon series has alluded to this past as well, but it's mostly done so through his behavior in the present. His flashbacks in episode 3 and promise to return to Vought's lab suggest The Boys will take a more direct approach to exploring his origin story. In doing so, season 4 can finally answer major questions about the Supe.\n\nThe Boys Season 4, Episode 3 Can Answer Key Questions About Homelander's Past This Storyline Can Explore Homelander's Vulnerabilities & Vought's Role In What He's Become Close\n\nThe Boys season 3, episode 4 begins to answer key questions about Homelander's past, and his return to Vought's lab will continue this deep dive into his childhood. After The Boys' first three seasons, it's no secret that Homelander grew up without love and affection. This directly feeds into his consistent need for praise, and it explains much of his sociopathic behavior. But while viewers are able to infer things about Homelander's past in The Boys seasons 1-3, season 4 can finally shed light on the boy named John and how he became the deadly Supe leading The Seven.\n\nAs Homelander returns to the place he was created, viewers can learn all the details about how the Supe came to exist. The Boys alludes to the fact that Homelander is the strongest superhuman, and therefore, special -- but now the series can offer further explanations about what makes him so different. The series can also dig into his past relationships and how they impact his present ones. While Homelander is a villain in The Boys, he's one with psychological issues connected to his childhood. By returning to it, viewers can unpack why.\n\nThis could also be an opportunity for The Boys to explore Vought's role in what Homelander has become. Gen V makes it clearer than ever that Vought is just as much a villain as Homelander -- perhaps more so given that the company created him. Vought uses Supes to do its bidding, and it's largely responsible for what they've become. It also destroys the lives of innocent people in its attempts to make money and claim power. Its part in Homelander's backstory may further drive this message home.\n\nWhy Is Homelander Revisiting The Vought Lab From His Childhood The Supe Wants To Erase His Humanity In The Boys Season 4\n\nHomelander is revisiting the Vought lab from his childhood because he wants to erase the remaining pieces of his humanity. The Supe struggles with feeling vulnerable throughout The Boys, and that's become increasingly noticeable in seasons 3 and 4. Soldier Boy's rejection of his son seems to have hit Homelander hard, and he's clearly desperate to have a relationship with Ryan -- even if he doesn't know how to. Ryan's interest in Butcher makes Homelander feel rejected, and this pushes him over the edge.\n\nHomelander is revisiting the Vought lab from his childhood because he wants to erase the remaining pieces of his humanity.\n\nBecause of his sensitivity to rejection, Homelander wants to rid himself of his feelings of inadequacy and need for love. He's realized how his past factors into these things, and he believes that confronting it will solve the problem. Knowing Homelander, his efforts to face his upbringing won't be healthy, and his perceived weaknesses will probably remain. Only time will tell how Homelander grapples with his origin in The Boys season 4. But whatever happens in the coming episodes, viewers are sure to learn more about him and Vought.\n\nThe Boys ActionDramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

As the show progresses, Starlight's powers, rooted in electricity absorption, continue to expand, making her a formidable force against powerful supes. With the introduction of her flight ability in season 3, Starlight's powers could grow further, setting the stage for season 4. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nIn the world of The Boys, Starlight's powers seem to have unlimited potential. She was a timid addition and possibly the weakest member of The Seven in the show's early seasons, but Starlight has come into her own throughout the series. As she's become more collected and confident, her abilities have evolved, creating a deeper meaning for Starlight's powers that are more reflective of the person she is. At the end of season 3, Starlight unleashed an ability she didn't know she had: flight. This showed the other supes (and the audience) that her power spectrum is anything but tapped.\n\nWith the upcoming release of The Boys season 4, the series has the chance to dive even deeper into Starlight's character and her power set. The show can explore not only her new-found flight ability but any other powers from the comics that haven't been used in live action. Now that she's fully up against some of the most powerful supes in the universe, like Soldier Boy and an even more unhinged Homelander, the full extent of her powers will be needed for even a chance at beating them and Vought once and for all.\n\nRelated Homelander's Heat Vision Is a Corruption of His Father's Powers - The Boys Theory Explained\n\nHomelander's heat vision is more than meets the eye as it secretly demonstrates just how much more powerful he is than his 'father' Stormfront.\n\nWhat Powers The Boys' Starlight Has Starlight Draws Her Powers From Electricity Close Photokinesis Electrical Siphoning Bioluminescence Photokinetic Flight Superhuman Strength, Durability, Reflexes, Hearing, and Healing\n\nStarlight's superhuman powers mostly come from her ability to absorb electricity from her surrounding areas, essentially using it to charge her power set. Thus far in the series, there has been no indication that there is a limit to how much electricity she can absorb or convert into herself, which broadly widens her potential of becoming one of the most powerful supes of all time. Her electricity absorption and manipulation contribute to her ability of photokinesis: the power to create concussive or blinding blasts of light energy from her hands. Using these powers also allows her to glow with bioluminescence.\n\nDepending on the amount of electricity she siphons from a particular source, the power of her blasts can be strong enough to disrupt the most formidable supes, including Black Noir, Homelander, and Stormfront. Outside her energy power set, Starlight also exhibits superhuman strength, durability, and reflexes, which have allowed her to hold her own against more powerful enemies. Her durability held up strong against A-Train, Black Noir, Stormfront, and other supes who, at the time she fought them, were much more powerful.\n\nStarlight also has superhuman healing, which has helped her heal from severe injuries in less than a day. She was stabbed with a diamond drill and shot with high-caliber bullets and healed quickly. In the comics, she shows off her superhuman hearing regularly, but in the show, it's one of the few powers that hasn't been explored.\n\nHow Starlight Got Her Powers In The Boys Another Victim Of Compound V Close\n\nWhen Annie January was just a child, her extremely religious mother and father decided to take Vought up on an offer to inject Annie with a serum known as Compound V. Rather than telling Annie what they did, they made her believe her powers were a gift from God, exploiting their daughter in hopes of making her a religious icon. While her father felt guilty and left the family, her mother continued the lie, making Annie believe her powers came from divine intervention.\n\nAs a child, Annie's powers would hurt when she used them. As she grew older and learned to control them, the pain stopped.\n\nIt wasn't until much later, when Annie found out all supes' powers were caused by Compound V, that she confronted her mother about all the beauty contests and pageants she was forced to participate in. In fact, it was this betrayal that caused Annie to join up with The Boys in taking Vought and Homelander down. Unfortunately, the Christian events were also what brought her and Supersonic close together, which ended in him joining The Seven and being killed by Homelander.\n\nWhy Starlight Can Fly In The Boys Season 4 Her New Power Was Discovered In The Season 3 Finale Close\n\nWhen Starlight discovers her new ability for flight at the end of season 3, she isn't able to fly very long. Her ability to fly works similarly to Electro in the Marvel universe, so when the electricity runs out, so does her flight power. If Starlight's able to fly for extended periods in season 4, she'll either need to absorb incredible amounts of surrounding energy from a huge electrical source or have a device that produces the energy for her. It's likely she'll fly in short bursts of energy, rather than having a full-on flight ability, like Homelander.\n\nHow Powerful Starlight Is Compared To Other The Boys Heroes She Gets Stronger With Each Season Close\n\nWhile it's proven that Starlight can easily dispatch regular humans, she's struggled against some of the more powerful supes in The Boys universe. As the seasons have continued, she's gotten stronger and shown she can compete with the likes of A-Train, who she defeats in a one-on-one battle, and Stormfront, along with the help of Kimiko and Queen Maeve. However, it's doubtful she would have been able to take Stormfront alone at the time. Starlight also threatens to use her powers on The Deep, who is a powerful supe in terms of strength and abilities but is a massive coward.\n\nStarlight puts up a good fight against Black Noir, but against all-powerful supes like Homelander and Soldier Boy, she doesn't really stand a chance. She's routinely been threatened by Homelander to the point of tears and going into hiding. She's also expressed regularly throughout the series that Homelander terrifies her, and he shows no intimidation from her at any point. Starlight's biggest weakness comes from her heart. When Homelander routinely threatens to obliterate the people that she loves or cares about, she buckles under his intimidation, allowing him to win the confrontation.\n\nHowever, just because Starlight isn't at the power level of Homelander or Soldier Boy yet doesn't mean she can't get there. At this point in the series, Starlight's powers seem to have no bounds as long as there's an electrical source around, so in the right environment or circumstances, she may even become stronger than either. Season 4 of The Boys could unlock Starlight's potential more and help her even the playing field for Hughie, Butcher, and The Boys. At the very least, she could use her powers to take out the weaker and more detestable characters, like The Deep.\n\nThe Boys ActionDramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

It's not surprising season four opens on election night -- the third-season finale promised intense political warfare -- but it's draining anyway. Prime Video's superhero satire boasts a crisp, funny grasp on the state of the world. Since its 2019 debut, the show has unabashedly poked fun at everything while still being gory and inventive. But as seen in \"Department Of Dirty Tricks,\" it's inching dangerously close to reality in a way that threatens to dampen its unique, most welcome commentary.\n\nLook, satirizing any topic without succumbing to its tropes is tough. To embrace what you're ridiculing, you have to also embrace it. The Boys has impressively treaded those waters so far but the lines are getting blurred more than ever before. (The direct references to Pete Buttigieg and Ron DeSantis are eyebrow-raising.) It's partly the weariness from real news and partly The Boys spinning in circles but episode one lacks the show's trademark energy and promise. It often feels as dreary as the current climate, not an insightful escape from it.\n\nIt's not like the hour-long opener isn't enticing. There's action, cool visuals, and Antony Starr's utterly scary performance as the supervillain Homelander. It's always horrifying to watch him parade that fake smile, made worse by his teen son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) now accompanying him everywhere as Homelander imparts his wisdom (comparing humans to cockroaches, etc.). \"Department Of Dirty Tricks\" is a standard season launcher: New arcs are set up (hello, Jeffrey Dean Morgan!), and old ones are closed (goodbye, Homelander's freaky fanboy, Todd). Yet the pacing feels off with some rushed introductions and characters drifting with no agenda.\n\nThe throughline remains Homelander's rivalry with, well, almost everyone. People either want to obey or obliterate him. But no one wants him gone more than Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), who has six months to live -- a sad aftereffect of injecting Compound V to gain temporary powers. Billy pushes through bodily pain, a mental breakdown, potentially aligning with another enemy, and getting all but kicked out of his crew for this goal. The Boys, except for Hughie (Jack Quaid), are tired of his pissy attitude, including the next de-facto leader Mother's Milk, a.k.a. MM (Laz Alonso) and Starlight (Erin Moriarty).\n\nSo Billy suffers some losses: Ryan refuses to reconnect with him. Grace Mallory (Laila Robbins) hits him with a verbal gut punch (\"There are people who, because of ignorance or insanity, still believe you have something to contribute.\" Oof.). The Boys also spectacularly fail to kill VP candidate Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), who rightly points out they keep getting worse at their jobs. Meanwhile, her stardom rises. She's one step ahead even if it means turning her daughter into a murderous supe, as Frenchie/Kimiko find out. Her own POTUS boss is secretly working against her to no avail yet. Hate her as we must, but Victoria remains The Boys' fascinating secret weapon.\n\nThere's still hope for Billy in the form of an old colleague, Joe Kessler (Morgan). They \"bump\" into each other, and Joe hints at needing Billy for a secret mission before supes cause more destruction. In the comics, Joe is a CIA analyst dubbed \"Monkey\" with a wild sexual fetish. The Boys doesn't follow the source material beat-by-beat, so we might be in for a surprise or two with him. But at least the seeds are planted for them to join forces because, at the end of the hour, Billy chooses not to team up with Victoria to bring Homelander down. He just sends her a butthole photo instead of the blackmail files she wanted as leverage. (What an image to end the episode with, huh?)\n\nHomelander's other nemesis, his former Seven teammate Starlight, went public in season three about her hatred of Vought. She's discarded her superhero personality in favor of her real self, Annie January. Not only does she work with the Boys, but she's also running an anti-Homelander campaign. The masses are also split into two factions: raging, loud misogynists who support faux Superman and relatively normal humans who are Team Starlight. And folks, a violent war brews between them all thanks to Homelander's new pal.\n\nYou see, even he's concerned that he's applauded no matter what, whether he saves a life or takes one. He's bored in the workplace because there's no one to challenge him (miss you, Queen Maeve!). To put this to the test, he orders The Deep (Chace Crawford) to give A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) a blowjob. (They get this close to doing it). Meanwhile, Ashley (Colby Minifie) blindly listens to Homelander because it's better than risking his wrath or, worse, pulling all her hair out again. In short: The dude's having an identity crisis and some strange dreams about the women in his life who've died -- we get brief glimpses of Stormfront (Aya Cash) and Madelyn Stillwell (Elizabeth Shue).\n\nSo what does he do to remedy it? Seek out another woman, of course. Homelander dons his casual best to visit Sister Sage (Susan Hayward), a new addition to the Seven. Her very cool and sexy power is that she's the smartest person. Yet she acts incredibly stupid in \"Department Of Dirty Tricks.\" Here's where I have trouble believing The Boys' logic. Why would Sage, an uber-intelligent Black woman, so quickly say yes to work with a viciously racist antagonist? He lures her with the notion of testing her theories about democracy on a global scale. She doesn't display fear and goes along with him, but we know nothing about her so their entirely rushed conversation is random. The Boys doesn't do a good job of building her up here. What is her agenda? She better have one to make this plot sensical.\n\nHer idea to boost Homelander is so basic, even Hughie could've come up with it. They round up his three maniacal followers, including Todd (Matthew Gorman), who spent season three dating MM's ex. He's killed and used as a prop to aggravate a riot in front of the courthouse where Homelander is declared not guilty at his murder trial (duh). The blame is promptly put on Starlight, whose haters now say she murdered Homelander worshippers in broad daylight. That was the grand plan of the smartest person on Earth huh? I sure hope the next few episodes treat Sage with the sensibilities and a fleshed-out arc that she deserves.\n\nTo close out the hour, The Boys sets up other key elements: Butcher is having visions of Becca (Shantel VanSanten), Deep is still dating his octopus (no shocker there), we finally meet Hughie's mother, who arrives in town after his dad suffers a heart attack. Welcome to The Boys, Rosemary DeWitt, let's see if you can help elevate Hughie's storyline because he desperately needs it.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Every episode of The Boys is over-flowing with quotable lines of dialog whether it's the filter-less Billy Butcher or the awkward culture shock of Soldier Boy adjusting to modern times.\n\nWhile characters Frenchie and Homelander have great quotes, Starlight has produced some amazing ones as well. Starlight isn't like most characters in The Boys. She wasn't initially driven by revenge. She's not evil or just naturally cynical. She was originally full of hope and the desire to truly make a positive difference in the world. As her worldview began to shift after experiencing the reality of being a part of The Seven, Starlight grew into becoming one of Vought's biggest threats. Starlight's character growth is on full display when looking back on some of her best quotes.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n10 \"If Billy Butcher Can Do The Right Thing...\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8 - \"What I Know\"\n\nClose\n\n\"If Billy Butcher can do the right thing, then there's got to be some kind of higher power.\"\n\nStarlight and Billy Butcher have rarely seen eye-to-eye. Butcher hates Supes, and he's not afraid to say how he feels about them. Butcher has struggled to fully trust Starlight no matter how much she's contributed. That lack of trust is reciprocated as Starlight has always felt Butcher was dangerous, rash, and constantly putting Hughie in danger.\n\nWhen Butcher tries to protect his wife's son Ryan from Homelander, despite Homelander being Ryan's biological father, Starlight shows respect where respect is due while explaining to Hughie why she's wearing a cross necklace. In the past, Starlight has doubted whether there is a God. Butcher doing the right thing may have been the miracle Starlight was looking for\n\n9 \"If You Jump Ship And...\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8 - \"What I Know\"\n\n\"If you jump ship and let the assholes steer, then you're part of the problem.\"\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys: 15 Best Quotes From The Show\n\nThe Boys is one of the most quotable shows in recent memory, from darkly funny one-liners to deep musings on the arbitrary nature of good and evil.\n\nIn that very same conversation with Hughie on a park bench comes another great Starlight quote. After all that's happened throughout the first two seasons, Hughie is concerned about Starlight staying in The Seven and returning to Seven Tower.\n\nStarlight explains that she needs to go back. That someone has to keep Vought in check. It's a great life lesson to learn as giving up, ignoring a problem, or letting perfect be the enemy of good allows the wrong people to win. If those people are left unchecked, so much can go wrong and those who had the power to prevent it, but didn't, are not much better than those \"assholes.\"\n\n8 \"It Doesn't Bother You That I Could Whip Your Ass...\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 4 - \"The Female of the Species\"\n\n\"It doesn't bother you that I could whip your ass in bowling? And in everything? And bench-press you?\"\n\nA relative loner working in an electric store dating the newest member of The Seven is fairytale-like in a way. Two people with extremely different backgrounds and upbringings come together and immediately click. Starlight and Hughie need each other. Starlight's Seven dream has been a nightmare and Hughie is still coping with the loss of his girlfriend to A-Train.\n\nOn their first date at a bowling alley, Starlight questions Hughie on whether or not her being so much more powerful bothers him as some guys would feel their masculinity is threatened. Hughie says it doesn't bother him, which he later reveals in Season 3 was a lie and a driving force behind him taking Temp-V24. That scene toward the end of Season 3 was heartbreaking because Starlight put a lot of trust in Hughie's initial response as she felt Hughie embraced her as both Starlight and Annie January.\n\n7 \"You're Just The Fish Guy...\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 2 - \"Cherry\"\n\n\"See, I asked around. You're not number two around here. You're just the fish guy. Everyone thinks you're a joke. Me, most of all.\"\n\nWhy was Starlight's Seven Dreams off to a nightmarish start? The Deep for starters. On her first day as a member of the Seven, The Deep took advantage of her. Claiming that he was second to Homelander in the Seven, he used his position of faux-power to sexually assault Starlight.\n\nWhile that night continues to traumatize her, Starlight finds the strength to stand up to herself and confronts The Deep by saying what everyone thinks of him, whether in The Boys universe or viewers watching the show. The Deep is a joke and his actions will, and ultimately did, come back to haunt him.\n\n6 \"You Don't Need Powers!\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 5 - \"The Last Time to Look on This World of Lies\"\n\n\"You don't need powers! You just need to be human!\"\n\nRelated\n\n15 Incredibly Shocking Scenes In The Boys, Ranked\n\nThe Boys has created a number of shocking moments, with some that stand out even by their standards.\n\nHomelander is a terrifying Supe. Antony Starr steals every one of his Homelander's scenes by instilling an immediate sense of tension. Homelander can kill just about anyone at a moment's notice and no one could do anything about it. His power to do so formulates his god complex.\n\nWhen Starlight attempts to get new Vought CEO Ashley Barrett to take action against Homelander to keep him in check, Ashley panics. She knows Starlight is right, but she's so scared of Homelander knowing how expendable she is in Vought's grand scheme of things. Starlight makes one final plea for Ashley to do the right thing, but Ashley decides to reaffirm that she's the Vougtht CEO and declines to do anything about Homelander for the sake of Vought. It does illustrate the dynamic at the core of the series which is humans vs. Supes, and Starlight knows regular humans are more powerful than meets the eye.\n\n5 \"Here's The Truth.\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5 - \"Good for the Soul\"\n\nClose\n\n\"Here's the truth. Anyone who tells you they know the answers is lying.\"\n\nOne of Starlight's best moments was her speech midway through Season 1. Starlight has returned home to Iowa for the religious Believe Expo. Before joining The Seven, this was Starlight's normal. The small town and religious community. After spending time away from home, her world has flipped upside down and it's completely changed her perspective of her hometown.\n\nWhen Starlight got on stage to give one of the keynote speeches, she abandoned her script and used it as an opportunity to vent. She questions her faith and she admits she doesn't know what she's doing and she's \"just as scared and confused as the rest of you.\" Her willingness to trust has been broken. Most importantly, she reveals what The Deep did to her, while not naming names, ushering in a PR nightmare for Vought while her speech itself boosted Starlight's image.\n\n4 \"Eat My S***, You Nazi B****!\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8 - \"What I Know\"\n\n\"Eat s***, you Nazi b****!\"\n\nOne of the most cathartic moments in The Boys came in the Season 2 finale. Stormfront, bearing a Nazi history and ideology, has become too powerful - even having Homelander under her influence. Her movement has become a force, which continues to carry on into Season 4. Starlight, Queen Maeve, and Kimiko finally got the upper hand on her. The heroic trio began punching and kicking a grounded Stormfront to the soundtrack of \"Boys Wanna Be Her\" by Peaches. In the process, Starlight uttered this fan-favorite line before Stormfront managed to flee.\n\nFrenchie quips that \"Girls do get it done,\" which is a nod to Vought's promotional tactic highlighting female Supes which in turn satirizes the awkward attempt at an empowering scene in Avengers Endgame. Stormfront's beatdown isn't a clean and cookie-cutter scene. It's brutal. In turn, The Boys manages an even more empowering scene.\n\n3 \"Since When Did 'Hopeful'...\"\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1 - \"The Name of the Game\"\n\n\"Since when did \"hopeful\" and \"na\u00efve\" become the same thing? I mean, why would you get into this business if not to save the world? That's all I have ever wanted.\"\n\nRelated\n\nThe Boys' Erin Moriarity Shares Surprising Revelation About Starlight\n\nErin Moriarity spills new details on how The Boys' season 4 storyline will challenge Starlight and even uncover some dirt about who she used to be.\n\nStarlight has always dreamed of being in The Seven. Or, at least, that's what she initially believed before conceding that this dream was everyone else's but her own. In her interview with Vought, Starlight explains her philosophy.\n\nStarlight explains that during her hero pageants when she was younger she always wanted to save the world. The judges would chuckle and brush it aside as if Starlight was just being cute, and that never sat right with her. Why skepticism? Starlight had always believed that there was no point in having powers unless it was to do good and change the world for the better. A philosophy that she still maintains, albeit in a way she never imagined when she was younger.\n\n2 \"And One More Thing - I'm Not Starlight Anymore.\"\n\nSeason 3, Episode 6 - \"Herogasm\"\n\n\"And one more thing - I'm not Starlight anymore. My name is Annie January and I f****** quit.\"\n\nStarlight has been through a lot since joining The Seven, to say the least. After three seasons of abuse, sexualization, Homelander's intimidation tactics, and realizing that the bottom line means more to Vought than saving the world, Starlight had enough.\n\nAfter Solider Boy's powerful clash with Homelander at Herogasm left death and destruction in their path, Starlight took the initiative to inform the masses what actually happened long before Vought could make their spin. Starlight exposes the truth about Homelander, Soldier Boy's survival, and the fact she has no idea where Queen Maeve is. Maybe dead. Starlight reveals her name, publically, before quitting The Seven for good. It's an awesome scene that feels like a proper evolution of her Believe Expo speech in Season 1.\n\n1 \"The Good Guys Don't Win. The Bad Guys Don't Get Punished.\"\n\nSeason 2, Episode 7 - \"Butcher, Baker, Candlestick Maker\"\n\n\"The good guys don't win. The bad guys don't get punished. What we do means nothing. It's just all for money and I am in the middle of all of it. Alone.\"\n\nStarlight's relationship with her mother is one of the more complex ones in The Boys. Starlight's mother had her injected with Compound V when she was a newborn to facilitate superpowers - powers Starlight thought she was born with. That breach of trust put a massive strain on their relationship when Starlight learned the truth of how Supes are manufactured instead of being the God-given miracles she was led to believe.\n\nUnbeknownst to Starlight's mother was the dark world of Supes and The Seven, which Starlight emotionally explains to her. This helps the two begin to reconcile at the coffee shop before Starlight realizes her mom accidentally set up a trap by contacting Vought to clear up vacation time so the two could have a vacation.\n\nThe Boys\n\nTV-MA\n\nAction\n\nCrime\n\nDrama\n\nSuperhero\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRelease Date

Episodes 1 and 2 established that Butcher (Karl Urban) is going it alone and his rival Homelander (Antony Starr) is struggling to put his fatherly duties to son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) over his ego and fame as supe icon. Caught in the middle are a Boys team struggling under CIA mandate and the leadership of Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso); Vought and The Seven members struggling under the Homelander regime, while Hughie (Jack Quaid) is struggling with family issues, and Annie (Erin Moriarty) is stepping up to make \"Starlight\" a political figure.\n\nOh, and somewhere in all this mess, Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) just became Vice President-Elect of America, with a secret supe-killing virus in her clutches. Times are looking so good for The Boys (sarcasm) that it was hard to measure how much Season 4 Episode 3 could hit us with, before the premiere event was over...\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Episode 3 Recap (Spoilers)\n\nPatriots Rally - The episode opens with a young man singing \"America the Beautiful\" onstage with a choir of young men. The shot pulls back to reveal it's a rally for Homelander (Antony Starr) with the crazed superman looking on at the gathered crowd, which is divided between \"Starlighter\" liberals and \"Homelander\" conservatives. Homelander is clearly getting a bit manic over all the noise from the opposition but has to maintain his public persona. He thanks the boys choir for singing, and highlights them as a symbol of classic American goodness. Homelander stokes the crowd against liberal Starlighters, claiming they want to replace classic superheroes with liberal snowflakes. Homelander welcomes The Seven onstage, including The Deep (Chace Crawford), A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), and the actor now playing Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell). Homelander thrills the crowd by introducing two new members: conservative pundit Firecracker (Valorie Curry) and the World's smartest person, Sister Sage (Susan Heyward). Sage doesn't love her African-theme costume but plays her part. Homelander teases a final slot open on the team, teasing his son Ryan could fill it.\n\nTo Kill Patriots - Butcher meets with old CIA pal Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who provides a sedative strong enough to incapacitate Ryan. The plan is to take Ryan to a supe-holding safehouse and reprogram him from Homelander's brainwashing - or at least keep him doped up until they finish Homelander for good. Butcher casts doubt that anti-supe Joe will honor his wish to save Ryan; Joe reminds Butcher that he has nowhere else to go, since The Boys cast him out.\n\nBack at the rally, Homelander has to lean in and threaten Ryan to smile. [The Boys title logo Flashes over the scene]\n\nMeet the New Seven - The Seven has their first press conference with their new members and Homelander is not impressed with Firecracker's redneck rhetoric. Sage assures him it is great for their media campaign to have an anti-Starlight figure like Firecracker; Sage and Homelander tiff about tensions between them, with Sage calling out Homelander for putting her in the spotlight, in a costume, when they agreed she would be background. Sage knows the directions she's given Homelander has rubbed his ego wrong, and makes their goal of a cultural coup harder. Homelander tires of talk and pushes Sage into the press line, while getting equally annoyed that Firecracker is quickly commanding attention from the cameras.\n\nFamily Matters - Hughie (Jack Campbell) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) try to see a lawyer about Hughie getting back power of attorney over his sick father (Simon Pegg), from his estranged mother Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt). Legally, it turns out, there's little for Hughie to do. Meanwhile, Frenchie (Tomer Capone) heads to Starlighter organization headquarters, to speak with his new lover Colin (Elliot Knight). Frenchie is there to tell Colin about how he was the one who murdered his family; instead, a radicalized Firecracker fan storms in demanding to free trafficked kids from the basement of the place. A confused organizer tries to explain there are no kids - or a basement - but the crazy man pulls a gun. Frenchie intervenes and stops the assailant, getting hurt in the process. A surprised Colin takes Frenchie aside and tries to care from him while asking how he's \"Jason Bourne,\"; when Colin goes in for a kiss, Frenchie grabs him and starts to confess. Instead, Colin is turned on and they passionately kiss.\n\nPresidential Moves - President-Elect Robert Singer (Jim Beaver) is holding a strategy meeting with his cabinet - which does not include VP-Elect Victoria Neuman. Neuman rushes in coyly saying she must not have gotten the memo to meet; Singer smoothly launches into his new policy of banning supes from all government service, relegating them to entertainment. Caught on the spot, Neuman has no choice but to agree, flashing a fake smile.\n\nUneasy Alliances - At Boys HQ Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) approaches Frenchie about tracking down a local cell of the Shining Light trafficking group and killing them, as means of therapeutically dealing with her past. Frenchie (who just popped some drugs) is not about it, but Kimiko calls on their ride-or-die bond to make him go with her. Meanwhile, Annie tries to train Hughie in how to fist-fight, but he's not built for it. M.M. is analyzing Homelander's new Seven team from rally footage and reveals his next move: flipping A-Train. Hughie and Annie object, with Hughie reminding M.M. that this whole team (and series) started with A-Train killing his girlfriend. M.M. pulls rank, but is quickly undermined when Kimiko and Frenchie leave without explanation. On TV, Annie hears Firecracker throw shade, claiming a woman has made it to The Seven without need of sexual favors (a callback to the Deep's sexual abuse of Annie).\n\nGame Times - Ryan is playing a video game based on The Seven and other supes. Ryan selects Lamplighter and enters an online match against Crimson Countess, only to find Butcher playing the other character and contacting him through the game's chat. At first, Ryan almost quits (to obey Homelander), but Butcher lures him into the game. Butcher tries to talk sense into Ryan while Ryan takes out his frustration on Butcher's game character, burning and slaughtering Crimson Countess.\n\nSeventh Circle - Homelander watches rally footage of Starlight with an increasingly loud ringing sound in his ears. He can't even hear Firecracker, who is excitedly dancing around him, starstruck. Firecracker quickly comes onto Homelander, letting him know (repeatedly) that \"anything\" he needs she will provide. Black Noir is speaking to Ashley (Colby Minifie), having an existential breakdown over the lack of direction in his role, and asking for more context. Homelander cuts the chatter, commanding everyone to sit at the table; Sister Sage makes a point to take A-Train's usual chair, in his face. Homelander dismisses Ashley from the meeting (a first), revealing that Sister Sage has essentially taken over her duties as Vought CEO. Sage confirms that Ashley has been moved to mascot status, which she quickly accepts and scampers away. Homelander commands her to find Ryan and then starts the meeting. Turns out Black Noir's new actor is narcoleptic, and The Deep has to kick him away; Sage reveals that a leak from inside Vought allowed Starlight to clear her followers' names. The Deep is chastised and relieved of his duties as head of Crime Analytics; A-Train is relieved to escape suspicion and gets a text from his brother Nathan (Christian Keyes) about a meet-up.\n\nDeep Issues - The Deep goes home and is confronted by his octopus lover Ambrosius (Tilda Swinton) about forgetting to clean her tank. Ambrosius wants to work on their relationship, as intimacy has grown stale. The octopus worries about what's going on with \"Kevin,\" but The Deep avoids the conversation, and the request to move Ambrosius to the tank over the bed, instead of the closet. Meanwhile, Ashley is having a tirade about her demotion in her office, while putting on some new expensive heels for a BDSM session with her man-slave Cameron (Matthew Edison). Ashley makes the resolution to finally quit Vought and go to work for Disney (clearly a great fit for her...).\n\nDelicious Drugs - Butcher is baking up a batch of spiked cookies when Ryan comes flying up to his door. He offers Ryan cookies, reminiscing about how Becca used to bake them, but Ryan doesn't eat them. Ryan asks Butcher if he's scared to be dying, and Butcher says he is. Ryan knows he's lying, and turns to leave, but Butcher ropes him into a game of foosball.\n\nFlipping the A-Train - A-Train comes to meet his brother at their old running track but finds M.M. waiting for him. M.M. counters A-Train's threats with the reveal that he has him on camera at Boys HQ betraying The Seven. M.M. calls out that A-Train has clear signs of guilt and PTSD, and that his new heart and second chance at life, have maybe made the pretend hero want to be a real one. A-Train's answer is \"F*ck you,\" and he cynically reflects on good deeds getting people killed. M.M. points out that the fastest man in the world hasn't run away from the conversation yet.\n\nHigh Time For Action - Frenchie and Kimiko infiltrate the Shining Light safehouse, where Kimiko realizes that Frenchie is high. Frenchie is indeed hallucinating heavily but tries to play it off. Kimiko jumps the traffickers and starts killing them, but all Frenchie can see are bubbles and rubber duckies in place of the blood. The phantom voice of Colin calls away Frenchie as more traffickers jump Kimiko; Colin is sitting on a couch with the corpses of his family. Colin calls Frenchie out as a serial killer without remorse; next to appear is mob boss \"Little Nina\" (Katia Winter), who calls Frenchie pathetic and a monster for his relationship with Colin. Meanwhile, Kimiko is killing more traffickers until she's jumped by a supe girl who recognizes her. When Frenchie comes in, gun ready, Kimiko stops him from hurting the girl - but refuses to answer who she is. The strange girl flees.\n\nFuseball Is the Devil - During their foosball game, Butcher reveals how he lost his brother Lenny to Ryan. Ryan opens up and reveals that he killed his training coach during his staged solo save, and that while his dad (Homelander) says he shouldn't care, he knows he's the kind of monster Butcher wouldn't want. Butcher gives a heartfelt speech about how he pushed Ryan away because he's actually the monster, who has no business around a good kid. Ryan argues Butcher is more than that, but Butcher is resigned in knowing he'll die with few friends, family, or fond memories, but losing Ryan is unacceptable. Butcher dumps out the cookies he was going to feed Ryan, claiming he overdid it on the sugar.\n\nDigging for Dirt - Sister Sage, Homelander, and Ashley bring in Anika (Ana Sani) from the Crime Analytics department to talk about her former friendship with Starlight. Sage wants to know why Anika called Starlight's organization in the last few months, but Homelander doesn't believe it was for \"donations.\" Sage calms things down and gets Anika to talk, but Homelander immediately lasers her through the head. Sage is annoyed, but Ashley is traumatized. Elsewhere around Vought Tower, Annie confronts Firecracker (who is staying in her old room), asking her why there is so much beef between them. Firecracker reveals that she used to be a pageant girl with Starlight, going by \"Sparkler.\" At one Miami pageant, Sparkler was bullied and humiliated after Annie spread a rumor that she was white trash, who had group sex with the judges to get entry in the pageant. Worse yet, when Sparkler confronted Annie, Annie told her she didn't talk to \"fat sluts.\" Annie tries to apologize and claim she's changed, but Firecracker maintains that she still sees the mean girl inside Starlight, and will make the world see it too. Annie is left shook.\n\nCulture Wars: The Show - An ice skating show based on The Seven practices a song about the Culture War against Christmas. Hughie and M.M. are watching from the rafters, disguised as janitors; M.M. reveals that A-Train fed them the intel about Victoria Neuman's rendezvous at the location; Hughie objects but M.M. pulls rank. Neuman arrives too early while Hughie is still up in the ventilation shaft. Hughie goes to plant a bug, but has to freeze in his tracks when Homelander, Sister Sage and Neuman meet underneath the vent he's over. Hughie overhears the trio talking about pulling off their coup, but Homelander goes further, revealing to Sage that Neuman is a supe, and making plans for her to become president and reveal herself to the world. Hughie's sweat lands on Homelander's shoulder, and he instantly knows that it's Hughie. Homelander begins lasering the vents, while Hughie frantically escapes; the chase spills over into the ice rink, and Homelander accidentally lasers one of the lead performers (\"Queen Maeve\") causing pandemonium and even more carnage on the ice. Sage and Neuman make a strategic exit, while Homelander heads to the roof. Hughie manages to get away when A-Train speeds him out of the place, leaving without explanation.\n\nWho's to Blame? - Frenchie and Kimiko find Annie drinking alone and join her. Frenchie tells a sad story about loving the bath his father would put him in when he'd visit prostitutes. Annie is more focused on personal accountability, after blaming so many others in her life (mom, Vought, The Seven). Kimiko tries to get Frenchie to confess what's happening to him; Frenchie counters by challenging her over the strange girl they encountered. The two realize that they maybe aren't as close as they pretend to be.\n\nWhy Momma? - Hughie meets his mom in the hospital and offers an olive branch - if she'll answer one question: Why did she leave him? Rosemarie says that depression and postpartum played a big part, which shocks Hughie because he thought she was so happy. She confesses to trying to kill herself the day before she decided to leave, and leaving because she was convinced she would die if she stayed. She said Hughie's father wouldn't let her make contact after that. She apologizes and Hughie breathes a bit easier.\n\nMission Clock - Joe is pissed at Butcher for not securing Ryan as an asset. Butcher wants to turn Ryan slowly, but Joe says there's no timeline for that - they either train Ryan or kill him, lest he ends up like Homelander.\n\nSteamy Seven - The Deep breaks in on Sister Sage, who is eating an Outback Bloomin' Onion and watching reality shows. She feeds Deep some unhealthy treat and then seduces him; the camera pans down to a bloody tool on the table, that Sage used for something nefarious. Homelander is waiting for Ryan, who lies about where he's been. Homelander can smell the Butcher on Ryan, and they argue about it. Homelander is genuinely hurt that his son doesn't seem to love him, but his rage boils over again, signaling a growing crescendo of something bad happening to Homelander's mind. After breaking a mirror, Homelander is left alone staring at the fractured glass, and all the fractured reflections begin talking back to him. Clearly, Homelander is losing his sh*t, and gets one clear order from himself: to go back to the lab that created him.\n\n[End Credits]\n\nThe Boys Season 4 is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

Homelander is not only one of the main characters in the series but also its overarching villain. He is the most powerful Supe in the world and appears to be nigh invulnerable. However, in The Boys Universe, everyone is in constant danger, even the man who has god-like powers. Here is what we have discovered about the prospects of Homelander's death in The Boys Season 4.\n\nDoes Homelander die in The Boys Season 4?\n\nHomelander is alive as of season 4 episode 3, but he has begun showing signs of aging. In the season 4 premiere, he finds a grey hair on his body and becomes frustrated. The presence of grey hair indicates that unlike his biological father Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles), Homelander doesn't have the power of longevity.\n\nWith Soldier Boy gone and Ryan being too young, Homelander doesn't have an enemy who can physically take him on. Further, The Boys aren't that big of a threat in season 4. Homelander takes a morbid pleasure when he learns that Butcher has a big tumor in his brain. So, this season, Homelander's biggest enemy is himself. He struggles with the responsibility of being a father to Ryan, as he remains petty, attention-hungry, and needlessly cruel.\n\nIn front of the public and Ryan, Homelander pretends to be a relatable and kind heroic figure, but his psychopathic tendencies have started to emerge. We speculate that as the season progresses, Homelander will become more unstable. However, that doesn't mean that he will die by suicide. If anything, he will deal with his issues like he always has: by inflicting violence and cruelty upon others. Given his stature in the series, he will likely make it to the fifth and final season of The Boys.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tamal_kundu@comingsoon.net", "name": "Tamal Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Art_History/Online_Courses", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Art History/Online Courses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/The-Boys-Homelander-Die.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 39, "textEnd": 46}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Here's what happened in the first three episodes of season 4.\n\nIt's been almost two years since the blood-soaked finale of The Boys season 3, and the new season picks up with VP candidate (and secretly murderous supe) Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) riling up her supporters on election night. We learned last season that Neuman is allied with Homelander (Antony Starr), so naturally, the Boys have a scheme to take her out.\n\nTheir plan is to slip into Neuman's hotel room and swap her eye drops with poison... but they never get that far. Frenchie (Tomer Capone) and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) are caught by Neuman's daughter Zoe (Olivia Morandin), who kills the traitorous Secret Service agents with the nightmare inducing, Lovecraftian tentacles she's hiding in her throat, a by-product of her mother dosing her with Compound V last season.\n\nWith Starlight's (Erin Moriarty) help, Kimiko and Frenchie barely escape. And just like that, their plan is kaput. Butcher (Karl Urban), to none of the team's surprise, is no assistance whatsoever, 'cause he gets distracted when he sees Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) sneak off to the kitchen for some ice cream and decides to ditch his comms and go after his beloved late wife's son.\n\nButcher pleads with Ryan to run away with him, far away from his sadistic father Homelander. He even reveals to Ryan that he's got less than a year to live. Ryan's clearly affected by this, but before he can react, Homelander enters and takes Ryan away.\n\nVery quickly, we get the sense that Homelander's story this season is all about legacy. But Homelander's not just concerned about what comes after him because he's a father now... it's because he's starting to age. And we're shown this in the most The Boys way humanly possible: by watching Homelander systematically pluck his stray gray pubic hairs and toss them in a jar for... safekeeping?\n\nHilariously, Homelander's far more concerned with the contents of that jar than he is with the impending verdict from his murder trial, a consequence (if you could even call it that) of killing a Starlight fan in broad daylight in the season 3 finale. He knows he won't be found guilty, just as well as the rest of the country does, and the Starlighter movement is ready to riot while the Home Team are ready to celebrate. But more on that later...\n\nFresh off the Boys' epic failure in the opening sequence, MM (Laz Alonso) meets with CIA operative Grace (Laila Robins) for a debrief. To our surprise, President-Elect Dakota Bob is there with her, having authorized the mission to assassinate Neuman (which is why Secret Service helped them get inside the building). Bob knows that the moment he's elected, he's a dead man, so he's tasked the Boys with offing his VP before Congress ratifies his election on January 6th.\n\nWhile MM strategizes with Grace, Butcher is forced to wait outside, having been stripped of his command of the Boys after his shady antics in season 3. But as Butcher stews in the waiting room, he's approached by an old friend, CIA agent Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).\n\nKessler's agenda isn't immediately clear, but it's evident from their brief conversation that he wants Butcher to reclaim his captainship of the Boys and do whatever it takes to stop Neuman from becoming America's next president and destroying democracy as we know it.\n\nOver at Vought, the search is on for a new member of the Seven. After a run-through of the top candidates - a racist, a zoophiliac, and as Deep (Chace Crawford) puts it, \"a butterface\" -- one candidate emerges as a frontrunner: the smartest woman alive, known as Sister Sage (Susan Heyward).\n\nFed up with the sycophantic nature of the current roster of the Seven and seeking a team member with the courage to stand up to him, Homelander pays Sage a visit. Sage quickly proves her bonafides, impressing Homelander with her blas\u00e9 attitude towards the Seven and her pitch for how to help him achieve his goals on a global scale.\n\nPretty quickly, we see Sage's genius at work. Jeff (the ex-partner of MM's wife Janine) along with two other Homelander superfans, is escorted by Sage to meet Homelander himself... but Jeff and his fellow Home Teamers' enthusiasm is dashed when Homelander orders Deep, A-Train (Reggie Franklin), and Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) to beat the fans to death with baseball bats. As usual, they obey, and as we're left to wonder just what the hell Sage and Homelander are up to.\n\nHomelander jets over to court, where he's declared innocent of the murder charges. Outside the courthouse, Home Teamers celebrate while Starlighters prepare to riot. Among the Starlighters, we see Sage, disguised in Starlight yellow, move to the front of the crowd - and pelt a coffee at a Home Teamer. Just as she planned, a brawl breaks out between the two sides. Meanwhile, A-Train speeds in and, unseen by the crowd, plants the dead bodies of Jeff and the other Homestaters in the thick of the melee. Now we see Sage's plan: the media blames the deaths on the Starlighters, distracting Americans with fighting against each other while the supes cement their stronghold on the country.\n\nButcher's dead-set on getting Ryan away from Homelander, and to make that happen, he makes a deal with Neuman - she'll help with Ryan if he gives her the blackmail Hughie has on her (from her time at the Red River foster home).\n\nHughie (Jack Quaid) is frazzled when he learns that his father (Simon Pegg) has landed in the hospital after suffering stroke. Butcher uses a moment of consolation to steal Hughie's CIA access key to find Neuman's blackmail, but when he does, he hallucinates his late wife and she convinces him to do the right thing. Cutting back to Hughie at the hospital, he's even more frazzled when in walks his mom (Rosemarie DeWitt), who abandoned him and his dad when Hughie was six years old.\n\nStray Observations\n\nEpisode 2 opens on A-Train, who's frustrated that Will Ferrell (who cameos as himself) has been cast as his brother and coach Nathan in his mid-production biopic. As he huffs back to his trailer, Noir approaches him concerned with how often Homelander asks them to murder people -- remember, the real Noir was killed by Homelander in season 3, and has been replaced by an actor.\n\nElsewhere in Vought's media empire, Homelander's son Ryan is pitched a take on his public profile as they ready him for his first save. The team wants to shine a bright light on his connection to his father, and everyone seems thrilled with the direction... except Sister Sage. She thinks the pitch \"blows harder than Nancy Reagan on the MGM backlot.\"\n\nSage feels Ryan should stand on his own. He's the first natural-born superhero, she argues, and thinks they should be presenting him as one \"chosen by God\" to save the world. The more distance they put between him and Homelander, the better for his image. Homelander's obviously enraged to have anyone suggest the spotlight shift even an inch away from his beautiful face, but he goes along with Sage's plan... for now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Boys regroup at their HQ, where Butcher finally tells them about his fatal condition. But instead of being met with sympathy, MM walks Butcher out of the office and tells him to pack up and leave - he's now more of a liability than ever.\n\nThe rest of the team gets back to work, splitting up to track down two leads: Starlight and Hughie trail A-Train to try to prove that the dead men at the Starlighter v Home Front brawl were not killed by two Black Starlight fans, as the media claims, while Butcher, MM, Frenchie, and Kimiko follow Sister Sage to a nauseating right-wing convention called \"TruthCon.\"\n\nAt TruthCon, we're introduced to two key supe figures in the Hometeam movement: Firecracker (Valerie Curry) who's essentially the YouTube version of Tucker Carlson, and Splinter (Rob Benedict), her creepy sidekick with the power to endlessly clone himself.\n\nAs the newly minted team leader, MM tasks the Boys with finding out what a genius like Sage is doing at a place like TruthCon. He and the team follow her, listen in on her conversations, and learn she's planning a meet with Firecracker and Splinter \"at 9 p.m. in the Deep Blue Sea Room.\" After somehow preventing themselves from vomiting while listening to Firecracker rant to a small crowd about Hollywood conspiracy theories, MM, Frenchi,e and Kimiko head over to the location for the secret meeting.\n\nBut when they arrive, the Deep Blue Sea Room is empty. They've been tricked by Sage, who struts inside with Firecracker, Splinter, and a handful of his armed clones. Sage orders the right-wingers to kill the Boys, but Splinter's come down with a nasty case of pink eye from... and there's really no delicate way to put this... using his clones to toss his own salad. The itch of the pink eye distracts Splinter, which gives the Boys an opening to fight back.\n\nIn a disgusting, hilarious, and thrilling fight sequence - The Boys' bread and butter - that spills out into an in-progress bar-mitzvah in the next room, MM, Frenchie, and Kimiko find themselves outnumbered and outmatched. They're about to be executed when Butcher busts in (of course he followed them to the convention) and saves them.\n\nWhile the TruthCon mission turned out to be a total bust, Starlight and Hughie try to make some progress with their investigation into A-Train. They watch as he tries to bond with his nephews, only to be admonished by Nathan for his crimes. A-Train dashes off before Starlight and Hughie can make a move, but when they return to their office, Starlight and Hughie find A-Train waiting for them. But he's not there to hurt them... he's there to help them.\n\nTo their shock, A-Train hands over security camera footage that exonerates two men accused of the Home Front riot murders, and we're left feeling a strange amount of sympathy for A-Train, the man who began this series as arguably the most hateable character in the entire cast.\n\nThe episode ends with Ryan filming his first \"save,\" for which he's been rehearsing all episode with Deep and a handful of stuntmen under Homelander's direction. We watch the staged bank robbery play out on a NYC street, and as Ryan moves in to \"save\" a little girl being held hostage by the \"robber,\" Homelander decides to crash the party.\n\nThis goes directly against Sage's plan, but Homelander's become self-conscious about relinquishing his spotlight. So he steps in and \"helps\" Ryan handle the situation, encouraging him to, as they rehearsed, throw the \"robber\" down the street. Ryan does as he's told, but accidentally throws the stuntman too hard, smashing him against a building like an insect.\n\nLater, we see that Ryan is traumatized by what he did, but Homelander offers no sympathy. \"Humans are just playthings\" he keeps telling him... but Ryan doesn't seem to buy it. Frustrated with what he perceives as weakness in his son, Homelander leaves him to his misery.\n\nStray Observations:\n\nButcher's making cookies. Special cookies. For a special someone - Ryan. CIA agent Joe Kessler's managed to get his hands on a powerful drug that's sure to knock Ryan out. All Butcher has to do is get him to ingest it (hence the laced cookies). Once he's unconscious, they plan on whisking him away to Grace's supe-proof safehouse to keep him locked up.\n\nBut that's part two of the plan. First, Butcher needs to get in contact with Ryan and convince him to sneak away from Homelander so they can talk. And the way Butcher does this is an absolute riot. In Vought Tower, we find Ryan playing a supe-themed, Mortal Kombat-inspired video game online. He's challenged by another player to a duel, and when it begins... Ryan hears Butcher's voice on the line. As Ryan annihilates Butcher's player character, Butcher begs him to come by his place to chat. Ryan isn't convinced, but he's clearly considering it.\n\nMeanwhile, the other members of the Boys are each on a fairly separate track. Starlight's growing increasingly frustrated with Firecracker's (now an official member of the Seven) crusade against her, and wants to shut her up once and for all. MM has recruited Hughie, much to his reluctance, to help him try to flip A-Train. And Frenchie has agreed to help Kimiko track down and wipe out a local cell of Shining Light, the child trafficking group that imprisoned her as a child.\n\nLet's start with Starlight. Sneaking into Vought, she confronts Firecracker and asks her to explain her vendetta against her - something that's perplexing Starlight since they've never even met. In a surprising turn, Firecracker reminds Starlight that they have met, years ago, on the pageant circuit. Apparently, Starlight, once a real mean girl, started a nasty rumor about Firecracker sleeping with the pageant judges that ruined her career. Starlight reels from the realization that she's not the hero in everyone's story.\n\nKimiko and Frenchie bust into a Shining Light hideout as Frenchie trips balls on hallucinogens, making him no help whatsoever to Kimiko, who single-handedly takes on the entire gang of Shining Light henchmen. Frenchie simply watches, the spray of their blood transforming into bubbles and floating rubber duckies in his drug-addled mind. As Kimiko kills the gangsters one by one, Frenchie wanders off into a room filled with visions of every person he's ever killed. Colin sits with his arms around his dead family, flanked by dozens of Frenchie's victims from his time as an assassin.\n\nFrenchie flees the room and runs back to Kimiko, who's facing off against a young girl with scars on her face. The girl tries to kill Kimiko, but Kimiko won't retaliate - because she recognizes her. Kimiko tries to talk to the girl, but she quickly runs off. Frenchie asks Kimiko who she was, but Kimiko won't say.\n\nElsewhere in the city, MM meets with A-Train, having cloned his brother's phone and lured him to his running track. MM pulls on whatever's left of A-Train's conscience and tries to convince him to turn on Vought. Shockingly, it works. A-Train tells MM the location of a meeting going down that night between Neuman, Homelander, and Sage at a local ice skating rink.\n\nHughie and MM sneak into the rink - where some kind of Vought sponsored theater/musical company is rehearsing a song/ice-dance number railing against the liberals trying to ruin Christmas - and get to work on finding Neuman.\n\nHughie crawls through air vents, Mission Impossible-style, finding Neuman and recording her conversation with Homelander and Sage. The supes discuss their plans - once Dakota Bob's election is ratified, they'll kill him, elevating Neuman to the presidency... and that's when they can really get to work: they want to dismantle the Bureau of Superhuman Affairs, and put a supe in every county with authority over the police. But that's not all Sage and Homelander want from Neuman. They want her to come out as a superhero.\n\nNeuman refuses, but before Homelander and Sage can press their point too hard, a bead of sweat from Hughie's brow drops (again, Mission Impossible-style) onto Homelander's shoulder. Immediately, Homelander identifies the scent as Hughie's, and he starts blasting away at the vents above him. Hughie scampers away as Homelander chases him.\n\nHughie manages to get away unscathed, but not without help - A-Train bolts in, saves him, and speeds him away to safety outside the rink. When Hughie asks A-Train why he saved him, he just runs off without responding.\n\nAfter the chaos at the rink, Hughie stops by the hospital to visit his dad and finds his mom waiting in the hall. The night's events took the fight out of Hughie, so he doesn't come at his mom like he's done in the last few episodes. Instead, he just asks: \"Why'd you leave?\"\n\nHughie's mom softens his heart with her truth: she gave birth to him when she was only 22, and soon found herself debilitated with postpartum depression. She tried her best to be a good mother, but the weight of her illness was too heavy to bear, and one night, she attempted suicide. After that, she knew she had to go. So she left. She tried calling Hughie, but his dad wouldn't let her speak to him for fear of confusing him. She doesn't ask Hughie's forgiveness, but she does tell him, from the bottom of her heart, that she's sorry for hurting him.\n\nOff this somber moment between mother and son, we jump over to Butcher, who's convinced Ryan to stop by his apartment. Butcher tries getting Ryan to eat the drug-laced cookies he's cooked for him, but Ryan isn't hungry. To keep him from leaving, Butcher challenges Ryan to a game of foosball. As they play, Ryan confides in Butcher his feelings of guilt over killing the stuntman in the staged save from episode 2.\n\nButcher, unlike Homelander, validates Ryan's feelings. And as Ryan opens up, so does Butcher, admitting that he's terrified of the prospect of dying, but more specifically, dying without doing a damn thing for the people he cares about. It's perhaps the most vulnerable we've ever seen Butcher, and it's a moment of true bonding between him and Ryan. And so deep is this moment that Butcher decides to throw the cookies out. He doesn't want to force Ryan into submission; he sees an opportunity to form a true relationship with him and let the boy make his own choice.\n\nOf course, when Butcher tells Joe Kessler what he did, Kessler's pissed. Butcher knows he did the right thing, but Kessler reminds Butcher of what's at stake. They either need to train Ryan to fight for them... or they need to figure out how to kill him.\n\nStray Observations:\n\nThe Boys season 3 episodes 1-3 are streaming now on Prime Video.

Sure, it's silly that a Trumpian Superman is the main antagonist of the popular superhero parody series. But! It's tough to say that the concept is any more or less moronic than what our actual former president is up to on any given day. Earlier this week, Trump warned a crowd in the Las Vegas desert about shark attacks after he was found guilty of more than thirty counts in a hush-money scheme with a porn actor. If that's not The Boys coded, then I don't know what is.\n\nSo the fact that Homelander (Antony Starr) kicks off season 4 with his own Trump-esque trial is no less surprising. Mirroring Trump's infamous quote that he could \"shoot somebody and not lose voters,\" Homelander ended season 3 by killing a man in broad daylight with his laser vision. Instead of fearing his power, his right-wing supporters absolutely loved it. Now Homelander finds himself more unencumbered than ever before.\n\nMeanwhile, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and Hughie Cambell (Jack Quaid) continue their operations as \"The Boys.\" They're working for the CIA to assassinate Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), an anti-supe congresswoman running for higher office. In the spin-off series, Gen V, she revealed that she secretly has superpowers herself. She also got hold of a deadly virus developed at Godolkin that can allegedly kill supes.\n\nThis virus sounds incredibly powerful, but as Billy quickly reminds us, it's not strong enough to kill Homelander yet. Damn! I guess that's why creator Eric Kripke announced that he's ending The Boys after season 5 -- and not season 4, episode 1. Sorry! Whoops! The virus isn't strong enough.\n\nMarvin (Laz Alonso) also informs his fellow Boys, \"We might have to accept the possibility that Neuman's invulnerable.\" After fighting off the congresswoman's daughter and her nasty mouth tentacles, Hughie throws acid on Neuman while Billy attempts to shoot her in the head. Both attacks fail. So it's back to the drawing board.\n\nFeeling secure that Butcher is incapable of killing him, Homelander searches for what to do with his life. He's having something of a midlife crisis -- as always -- spurred by the white pubic hairs he picks off his testicles while taking a piss. He openly believes that humans are toys for his amusement, but he's run out of ways to make humanity dance for his pleasure. At a meeting to recruit more supes to the Seven, his only options are a border-patrol officer named the Warden and a man named Dogknott who reportedly \"ate out a dog.\"\n\nHomelander cries that he's \"surrounded by imbeciles.\" Everyone around him simply does whatever he says without any objections. When he orders the Deep (Chace Crawford) to perform fellatio on A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), he stops them both right before the act to prove that \"not one of you has the stomach to challenge anything I say.\" He seeks out Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), a woman who claims to be the \"smartest person in the world.\"\n\n\"I need advice,\" Homelander tells her. \"I save people. They cheer. I kill people. They cheer. It's meaningless.\" He wants to leave behind a legacy, but he has no idea what would make him happy. Knowing that he won't kill her in retaliation because he needs her help, she challenges his platform thus far. If he crushes the masses with an army of Nazi supermen, who will build his statues? You've just got to nudge 'em a little, then swoop in and save them. \"Like Caesar,\" Homelander responds. He offers Sage a spot on the Seven.\n\nSeveral characters join the party for season 4. In this episode, Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Walking Dead) makes his series debut as Joe Kessler, an old Army buddy of Butcher's. It's not quite clear what his role is moving forward, but maybe it has to do with the fact that prolonged usage of Compound V is destroying Billy's brain. He's seeing ghosts and vomiting, with just a couple more months to live. Desperate to find a way to free Homelander's son from his grasp, Butcher almost betrays Hughie to work with Neuman. At the last second, a vision of his dead ex-wife convinces him to find another way.\n\nSpeaking of characters that we thought were dead, Hughie's mom (Rosemarie DeWitt) shows up after his father is hospitalized from a stroke. I guess we won't see much of Simon Pegg this season, but he has another Mission: Impossible to film, so I can't blame him. There's also a new Black Noir, who is cheekily played by the same actor (Nathan Mitchell), since he never showed his face before he died.\n\nAt a private fan meeting, Homelander orders the Deep, Black Noir, and A-Train to beat three men to death with baseball bats. They comply, still afraid to defy their leader. \"That was so fucked up, you guys,\" the new Black Noir says. It's a pretty big deal, as the last Black Noir never spoke.\n\nThat same day, Homelander is found not guilty at his trial for murdering a guy in public. Outside the courthouse, his supporters yell obscenities across the picket line. Annie's (Erin Moriarty) Starlighter campaign is growing on the left, but it's about to hit a major snag. Sage attends the rally dressed in Starlighter gear and incites a riot. The Boys arrive and try to stop the violence, but there are too many agitators. A-Train then runs over the dead fans from earlier at super speed so that it looks like the Starlighters were just as violent as Homelander's supporters. As Sage advised, Homelander is creating chaos in order to swoop in and be the savior once again. I have only one major question: What does Sage get out of this?", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Quaid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Quaid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

Despite having a ton of superheroes, I'd say no one on this show is truly a hero. But some characters are up to some seriously nefarious activities. Quite a few villains are at play in The Boys season four, so let's look at how they are shaking up this universe.\n\nOf course, the chief antagonist is Homelander. He's trying to mold Ryan in his own twisted image and is willing to do anything to take down Annie/Starlight and the Boys for good. Homelander is threatening Victoria Neuman, lasering the heads of innocent people, and being an all-around d*ck to most of his Vought family. He's also unraveling mentally so he could do or say literally anything at any moment. Interestingly, he's actually not the mastermind of this season's most heinous acts so far.\n\nThe one who is really calling the evil shots is Sister Sage. Homelander brought her into the fold to help sustain Vought's power and destroy everything that Starlight has built. And boy is she using her smarts to the wildest extent. She convinces Homelander to have A-Train, Black Noir, and the Deep murder three of Homelander's biggest fans and pin it on two Starlight supporters. (Her doing this as a Black woman and framing two Black men is exceptionally nasty work.)\n\nShe's also turned the Deep against Ashley, which helped her secure power as Vought's CEO. And, she brought Firecracker, a dangerous conspiracy theorist with a rabid following, into the fold to tell her lies on a really large platform. Sister Sage may not be killing people directly but she is certainly a villain in The Boys season four.\n\nBeing a dangerous \"truther\" aside, Firecracker is dangerous because of her deep-seated hatred for Starlight. In episode three, we discover Firecracker was shunned from the pageant world after Annie told people she had sex with judges. She's certainly within her rights to hate Annie's guts but she's also putting a lot of innocent people in danger with her lies and twisted propaganda. Homelander's followers are bad, but her devotees are 10 times worse because they will literally believe anything she says. Sounds familiar, right?\n\nVictoria is also up to no good. She's only days away from becoming the next Vice President, a position she doesn't intend on staying in very long. Victoria is working with Homelander and Sister Sage to get Robert Singer out of the way so she can be the President. Once installed, they want Victoria to give supes ultimate power in every city and get rid of any educational platforms/theories that are \"anti-supe.\" After what happened with Soldier Boy killing MM's grandfather and Blue Hawk's murder of an innocent Black man, this certainly isn't good for society.\n\nOf course, there are other people who aren't exactly heroic.

The stress Homelander faces in season 4 is likely contributing to his graying hair and speedy aging. The Supe is collecting his hairs in The Boys season 4 as a reminder of his own mortality and desire to leave a lasting legacy behind.\n\nHomelander is under immense pressure as The Boys season 4 opens, and viewers may be wondering why the Supe is getting gray hairs in the newest episodes. The Boys season 4 opens with Homelander plucking a gray pubic hair while going to the bathroom. It's clear this isn't the only one he's gotten recently. He's filling a jar with gray hairs and keeping them with other objects in his residence at Vought Tower. The Supe is obviously bothered by them, and they hold a deeper meaning heading into The Boys' new episodes.\n\nWhen Homelander seeks out Sister Sage, she reveals that Homelander's graying isn't limited to a few pubic hairs. The Supe's stylist is dying the hair on his head as well, as it's also showing signs of aging. Homelander's graying hair may come as a surprise to those watching The Boys season 4. However, there's a simple explanation for what's happening to The Seven's leader, even if it feels somewhat out of character for him.\n\nRelated The Boys: 25 Differences Between The Comics & The Show\n\nThe Amazon superhero series The Boys is based on a comic book series of the same name. Some things were changed comparing the comic book vs. show.\n\nHomelander Does Get Older In The Boys (But He Ages Slowly) Season 4's Added Stressors Are Speeding Things Along\n\nAlthough Homelander's gray hair may come as a surprise to viewers, the Supe does get older in The Boys -- just slower than the average person. Season 4's gray hairs are a reminder of this fact, successfully humanizing Homelander as he becomes a greater threat than ever. With The Boys team still struggling to take him down, Homelander's gray hairs serve as a reminder that he's still a person with vulnerabilities. Sister Sage tells him as much when he visits her, pointing out that he still ages despite holding \"a lot of power.\"\n\nIt's no coincidence that Homelander is getting gray hair in The Boys season 4, which significantly ramps up the stress the Supe is experiencing.\n\nIt's no coincidence that Homelander is getting gray hair in The Boys season 4, which significantly ramps up the stress the Supe is experiencing. He's on trial when the fourth outing opens, and he's hoping to make a bid for even greater power. The Seven is a mess, and Vought is his responsibility now. All of this is weighing on him, and that's not to mention the \"existential mid-life\" crisis Sage accuses him of having. These things are speeding up Homelander's aging, and that goes beyond his hair. Sage reveals that he's peeing more, and other physical signs could surface later.\n\nHow Old Homelander Really Is During The Boys Season 4 The Seven's Leader Is 41 Years Old In The Amazon Show Close\n\nWhen Sister Sage says that Homelander is having a midlife crisis in The Boys season 4, she's spot on about his age. In Amazon's adaptation of The Boys, Homelander is born in 1981, making him a little older than 40 years old in season 4 (via Fandom.com). He's not so old that it's impacting his physical abilities, but he is hitting the period where gray hairs and other signs of aging are bound to surface. The fact that he's feeling the stress of The Boys seasons 3 and 4 adds to this, highlighting that he isn't as young as he appears.\n\nIt's easy to forget that Homelander is middle-aged, as Supes tend to have strength and speed that are more likely to be associated with youth. Vought also ensures that The Seven keep up their appearances, using stylists and other resources to maintain their hair, skin, and physique. The slower aging process also helps Supes seem younger in The Boys. And given that Homelander is collecting his gray hairs in season 4, it's obvious he's having trouble accepting that he's getting older.\n\nWhy Homelander Is Collecting His Gray Hairs It's A Reminder Of His Mortality\n\nStranger than Homelander going gray is the realization that he's collecting and keeping his hairs in a chest of mementos. However, his seemingly odd behavior makes sense when one considers his storyline in The Boys season 4. Looking at the other objects in Homelander's treasure chest -- which include a photo of Stormfront and a milk bottle -- it's clear that all of his keepsakes have bittersweet memories attached to them. The hairs are a reminder of his mortality, and they fit in well with this motif.\n\nThe hairs are a reminder of Homelander's mortality, and they fit in with the other objects well.\n\nHomelander's focus on his mortality ties into his motivations in season 4, as the Supe wishes to find meaning in what he does. He admits as much to Sister Sage, and he justifies his bid for power through his relationship with Ryan. Homelander begins looking to the future in The Boys season 4, insisting he wants to build a better world for his son. As he ages, he realizes he won't be around someday and will need to create a lasting legacy to combat that. Unfortunately, that legacy doesn't bode well for non-Supes.\n\nThe Boys ActionDramaCrime Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nThe Boys is a superhero/dark comedy satire series created by Eric Kripke based on the comic series of the same name.

The fourth season of the \"The Boys\" (first three episodes streaming now, then weekly on Thursdays) has a powerful figure on trial in Manhattan, scenes of angry protestors, Americans divided along ideological lines and even an upcoming presidential election.\n\nSound familiar? As \"Boys\" creator Eric Kripke puts it, they're simply \"supe-ifying\" what we see in everyday culture. \"There'd be a superhero really behind the QAnon movement and really motivating people with conspiracy theories. Or the world's smartest person would really be manipulating people into splitting up (politically) if it served their interest,\" he teases about upcoming episodes.\n\n\"We are reflecting what's going on in the real world. Frankly, I wish it would quit giving me so much material.\"\n\nThe Boys would probably prefer an easier go of it, too. In Season 4, Butcher (Karl Urban), Hughie (Jack Quaid), Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), Frenchie (Tomer Capone) and M.M. (Laz Alonso) are still trying to take down vicious homicidal superman Homelander (Antony Starr) and his group, The Seven, as well as the evil corporation Vought International. However, with head-exploding supe Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) - who's in cahoots with Homelander - on the way to the vice presidency, the bad guys are closer than ever to absolute power. (Jeffrey Dean Morgan joins \"The Boys\" this season as Butcher's ally Joe Kessler, while Susan Heyward and Valorie Curry play new supes Sage and Firecracker.)\n\nMaking things worse, our heroes, including Annie January (Erin Moriarty), aka Starlight, have to come to grips with their pasts. Annie escaped Vought's clutches, works with her boyfriend Hughie and the Boys, and squares off against Homelander as a hero viewers see as \"unambiguously good,\" Moriarty says.\n\nWhere to find it 'The Boys' Season 4: Premiere date, cast, trailer, how to watch and stream\n\nBut in the new season, she \"confronts some demons from her past and demons that are present that contradict who she is, who she knows herself to be,\" the actress adds. \"She needs to kind of fill in the gaps herself, and her own identity needs to be intrinsically found.\"\n\nHer relationship with Hughie is \"stronger than we've ever seen them,\" Quaid says. Hughie comes face to face with his estranged mom Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt) - \"It's so cool to take a character, one you've actually been playing for a while, and finally get to delve into their core trauma and what makes them tick\" - and continues to be a moral center for the heroes.\n\nIn one key scene, Hughie tells his teammates that \"if we're ever going to win against monsters, we need to start acting human\" and that \"violence isn't brave.\"\n\nQuaid says that's \"the secret little message of the show. I just love that I'm playing a character who started out in Season 1 desperately wanting revenge for his murdered girlfriend, and three seasons later he is saying stuff like this.\"\n\nEven the monsters have their problems. Homelander struggles with his mortality and goes \"home\" this season, although he's as unhinged as ever. The Season 3 finale saw the narcissistic villain laser a guy's head off, leading to cheers from a bloodthirsty crowd, and the new season is a continuation of finding out what he can get away with in terms of pursuing power and murdering people.\n\nJoin our Watch Party!

But \"he's not very good at team sports,\" says Starr, adding that the new season boasts a scene that's \"one of the strangest things I've ever done in my career. And I've done some pretty weird (stuff), brother.\"\n\nHomelander, who's now a character in video games like \"Mortal Kombat\" and the star of many GIFs and memes on social media, is a symbol of how much of pop culture \"The Boys\" has become in a relatively short period. There's more to come: Kripke says his writer's room has convened for a fifth and final season of \"The Boys,\" and the second season of spinoff \"Gen V\" is currently in production.\n\nQuaid says that when started on the show, \"I was like, oh, maybe one day I'll be in a Marvel movie or something, but I never thought I would be the first brick in the wall of this universe.\"", "source": {"uri":

Created by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, the premise of the series is to chronicle the adventures of the supe-hating sect of the CIA known informally as \"The Boys\". Led by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban; Dredd), The Boys' mission is to destroy the superheroes who seemingly have their own agenda and who may not be nearly as altruistic as they seem.\n\nIn 2019, showrunner Eric Kripke (Supernatural) transformed the anti-heroic group into a television series for Amazon. Starring Urban, Jack Quaid (Scream) as Hughie, the Billy Joel loving dork whose girlfriend was killed by A-Train (Jesse T. Usher; Shaft), Antony Starr (Wish You Were Here) as Homelander, the leader of the Supes who has an ego the size of Texas, Erin Moriarty (Captain Fantastic) as Starlight/Annie January, a female supe who has no idea who she is dealing with when she joins the 7, etc., The Boys is anything but your typical, superhero fare. An unethical, politically incorrect, depraved group, both the supes and the boys engage in underhanded, potentially illegal, warfare in their quest for control.\n\nOriginally intended to be a feature film, the property turned into a limited series that premiered on the streaming network, Amazon Prime, in the summer of 2019. Season two followed in September 2020 while Season three premiered in June of 2022. The debut of season four was delayed due to the writers' and actors' strike and the first three episodes will be available on June 13, 2024. A new episode will then air every week until the season finale on July 18, 2024. Kripke has already announced that season five will be the series' last.\n\nAs season three ended, Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles; Supernatural) and Maeve (Dominique McElligott; Leap Year) team up to kill Homelander but when Soldier Boy attacks Homelander's son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti; Big Little Lies), The Boys, Annie and Butcher attack him instead. Homelander, manages to escape with Ryan after the two reconcile, and Butcher, who is terminally ill, is determined to extract Ryan from Homeland's clutches as per Ryan's mother's, Beeca (Shantel Van Santen; The Flash), wishes. Meanwhile, Congresswoman Victoria Newman (Claudia Doumit; Timeless), is vying for the vice presidential role while she is out to stop supes for good. Ironically, though very few people know it, she is a supe herself.\n\nKripe has never been one to pull his punches when it comes to The Boys and season four holds just as many questionable and bizarre moments as did the previous three seasons. There also seems to be quite a bit of tension growing between Starlight and Homeland supporters, which in some ways seemingly mimics many of the events currently occurring in the United States. Of course, The Boys wouldn't be The Boys without numerous curse-laden scenes and unique scenarios.\n\nAmazon spares no expense with the production of this show and it pays off with audiences. From some of the goriest, bloodiest kills to the special effects of superheroes flying, running, and fighting, the regrowth of limbs, and the splitting of supes, every scene is well done and doesn't look cheesy. As with seasons past, there are also some new characters introduced, as well as, some great cameo appearances.\n\nFans can expect more of what they love about The Boys, with some new plot twists to keep things interesting in season four while paving the way for the final season yet to come. With the main cast and crew remaining intact, not too much has changed in the world of The Boys, yet almost everything seems somehow new and interesting.", "source": {"uri": "flickdirect.com",

As he rallies the gang for an assault on corrupt superhero leader Homelander (Anthony Starr), other nefarious groups start to make moves in the shadows. You can watch the trailer below.\n\nThe Boys season 4 episode 3 ending explained\n\nIn the final moments of The Boys season four episode three, Homelander, who has been experiencing somewhat of a confidence crisis (he found grey pubic hairs at the start of the season and he can't relate effectively to his son, Ryan), is seen arguing with himself in a cracked mirror in his penthouse apartment.\n\nPresumably a result of Homelander's psychotic personality, four versions of his face give him different advice until one silences the rest and says: \"It's time to overcome this need for love, this sickness - once and for all. You're never gonna be your true self until you transcend your humanity... You need to go back to the start. John, you need to go home.\"\n\nThe viewer is then shown a series of snapshot images from Homelander's (real name John Gillman) memory: a shadowy, red door; an older woman's face; someone in a lab coat handling sharp scientific-looking tools; a blowtorch being used. We then cut to black.\n\nWhere does the red door lead to?\n\nHomelander is a lab-created superhero, engineered by sinister corporation Vought in the early 1980s. When The Boys begins, in the late 2010s, he is leader of 'The Seven', Vought's elite superhero force marketed as mankind's protectors who actually abuse their power behind the scenes. In the course of the series, Vought's big secret - that they use a drug to create the superheroes called Compound V, rather than recruiting naturally-gifted child prodigies - is revealed to the public.\n\nIn recent spin-off series, Gen V, which follows new recruits at supe college Godolkin University, it is revealed that Vought has been testing and torturing some of their students in the hopes of creating a virus that can kill them (to ultimately control them more closely).\n\nIt's not a stretch to imagine that when Vought created Homelander, they used equally vicious and cruel methods to see what he was capable of. This could be what he is remembering in the final seconds of season four episode three. The red door, presumably, leads to the lab where these experiments took place during his childhood and adolescence - before he became the depraved villain The Boys fans know as Homelander.\n\nIn a 2022 episode of animated anthology series The Boys Presents: Diabolical, this was indeed confirmed to be what happened to Homelander. Flashbacks of his childhood during One Plus One Equals Two revealed the systematic torture he received from Vought scientists testing the extent of his powers.\n\nAs for the woman we catch a glimpse of, it's possible she is his first handler. Homelander is known for responding best to women. In season one, he seemed to have a closeness with Vought CEO Madelyn Stillwell, one of the only people at the company capable of keeping him under control. In one scene, he was even seen suckling on her breasts. Could this mystery woman be another of his female confidantes - or even, perhaps, his mother?\n\nThe remaining five episodes of this season are set to hit Prime Video on a weekly basis, with the final one arriving on July 18.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_pilley@nme.com", "name": "Max Pilley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Ennis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Ennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darick_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darick Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_Presents:_Diabolical", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boys Presents: Diabolical"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthology series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prodigy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child prodigy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other Media", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the_boys_season4_two.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 187, "textEnd": 194}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 4138, "textEnd": 4145}], "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Homelander forms an alliance with Sister Sage, setting the stage for a dark and politically relevant season. The premiere doubles down on satire and introduces compelling new characters, maintaining the show's fiery tone.\n\nWhen The Boys first premiered in 2019, superheroes were still the dominant force in Hollywood. Avengers: Endgame had recently claimed the title of the highest-grossing movie of all time (only for that title to be reclaimed by Avatar not long after), movies about Captain Marvel and Aquaman had grossed a billion dollars, and we were just a few months away from the arrival of the ever-controversial but massively successful Joker.\n\nThe Boys has never really felt like your standard superhero fodder. After all, the creator of its source material, Garth Ennis, has famously confessed his disinterest in the genre. Showrunner Eric Kripke has created three blood-soaked, sex-fueled seasons that are far more than just another \"superheroes gone bad\" story. The Boys tackles fascism head-on as a scathing satire on capitalism, Trumpism, the virtue-signaling elite, and more. There may be a lot of dismemberments and casual nudity, but The Boys has always been a show that perfectly encapsulates the era we're living in. But Season 4, as was recently revealed by Kripke himself, is officially the penultimate season of the series.\n\nSeason 3 ends with Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) having faked her death to leave the corrupt superhero team known as the Seven. The team's leader, the deranged Homelander (Antony Starr), ruthlessly murders the crew's silent but deadly member, Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell). Meanwhile, the incognito head-exploding Supe Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is on her way to becoming the Vice President of the United States. Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) finds out that he is terminally ill after his extensive use of V24 (aka Temp V) and only has months to live. Ex-Seven member Starlight (Erin Moriarty) is now officially a part of the Boys and has become a reluctant political activist against Vought. Homelander and Butcher's late wife's son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), having aligned himself with the insane Supe, attends a political rally, where he is attacked by a Starlight supporter. In the final minutes of Season 3, Homelander finally snaps, murdering the protester in front of a rapturous crowd.\n\nThe Boys TV-MASuperheroAction Sci-FiDramaCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Main Genre Superhero Seasons 4 Studio Amazon Studios Expand Smash Mouth Kicks Off 'The Boys' Season 4 With a Botched Assassination Attempt\n\nSeason 4's premiere, titled \"Department of Dirty Tricks,\" opens on election night, where presidential candidate Robert Singer (Jim Beaver) and his running mate, Victoria Neuman, are hosting a party. As Neuman speaks to the crowd, Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso), Frenchie (Tomer Capone), Hughie (Jack Quaid), and Annie are preparing to assassinate Neuman in her private hotel suite. However, before they can even get started, Butcher has fled from the group, intoxicated, delusional, and throwing up near the dumpsters. Frenchie and Kimiko find him and are immediately concerned, but give him his disguise, which he promptly trashes. Somehow, the trio still makes it into the building, but as soon as they reach the elevator, Frenchie and Kimiko receive an order from MM to force Butcher to stay back.\n\nIt is also revealed that Homelander is also attending the event, and we first see him stoically using a urinal, examining a strand of his gray pubic hair. In any other series, this may seem like a stretch, but this kind of weirdness isn't even that strange in the world of The Boys. He then meets up with Ryan, who is nervous about presenting himself at the rally. Homelander asks his son, \"Would you be scared of a bunch of cockroaches?\" to which Ryan meekly replies, \"Yeah.\" Homelander sadistically comforts Ryan with the reminder that \"They're only humans, and toys for our amusement.\"\n\nThe Boys' plot is interrupted once they realize that Homelander and Ryan are in attendance. Homelander meets up with Neuman, where it's revealed through their conversation that he is now on trial for the murder of the pro-Starlight protester in the Season 3 finale. Backstage, Butcher sees Ryan walking with Neuman's daughter Zoe (Olivia Morandin) and follows him to the kitchen, where he attempts to plead with him to get away from Homelander. Ryan tells Butcher that, according to Homelander, the protester he killed was a pedophile. Their conversation is short-lived once Homelander walks into the room and chides Butcher. He then leaves with Ryan, saying, \"I do not want to miss Smash Mouth.\"\n\nAs \"Walking on the Sun\" plays in the background, Frenchie and Kimiko make their way into Neuman's hotel room. As they attempt to toy with Neuman's eye drops, Zoe walks in and, while talking to security, spots Frenchie and Kimiko. Zoe then unveils her new Supe abilities as four sharp-toothed tentacles spring out from her mouth and devour the faces of the security men. She then swiftly attacks Frenchie and Kimiko, biting off the latter's right arm. The pair jump out the window, with Annie catching Frenchie and failing to do the same with Kimiko thanks to her slowly-regenerating baby hand, leading to Kimiko face-planting onto the glass-coated concrete (though her face also regenerates before the eyes of her grossed-out colleagues).\n\nNeuman discovers Hughie in the Boys' van, and the latter questions her about why she turned her daughter into a Supe, to which Neuman replies: \"To keep her safe.\" She attempts to lie to Hughie by saying she always cared about him, and Hughie's response is to throw acid on Neuman, which isn't that effective besides producing some holes in her suit. Butcher then attempts to shoot Neuman in the head but somehow misses. Numan gets notified that she and Singer have just won Arizona, meaning they have won the presidential election.\n\nThe Seven Needs New Members in 'The Boys' Season 4 Premiere\n\nSometime after the botched assassination, Butcher and MM meet up with Grace Mallory (Laila Robins) at the CIA headquarters. Butcher is barred from the meeting, where it's revealed to the audience that Singer has been conspiring with the CIA and the Boys against Neuman. The team only has until January 6, when the election is certified, to take out Neuman before she decides to explode Singer's head too. In the lobby, Butcher reconnects with Joe Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), an old accomplice whose life he saved over a decade earlier. Kessler tells Butcher that the CIA still needs him before the inevitable Supe uprising occurs.\n\nMM gets a call from his ex-wife Monique (Frances Turner), who tells him that their daughter, Janine (Liyou Abere) has been acting up more and more ever since her step-dad Todd (Matthew Gorman) disappeared, having become swept up in pro-Homelander conspiracies. Monique pleads with MM to find Todd, and he reluctantly agrees.\n\nBack at Vought Tower, The Deep (Chace Crawford) appears in an interview, denying the claims his ex-wife made in her tell-all book about him having an affair with an octopus named Ambrosius (more on that later). Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) leads a meeting about recruiting a new member of the Seven, including Talon, Hyperion, Dogknott, Wrangler, and Sister Sage (Susan Heyward). A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) reveals that he previously worked alongside Sister Sage, whose power is that she's the world's smartest person. Black Noir is also in attendance at the meeting, somehow still alive after being dismembered not too long ago. Homelander has become sick of his team members and Ashley constantly trying to appease him. To prove a point, he orders the Deep to perform a lewd sex act on A-Train, and the two nearly do it before Homelander stops them, disgusted by their willingness to do anything he demands.\n\nThe Boys reconvene at their office, as Hughie rejects a call from his father (Simon Pegg). Annie and Mother's Milk try to convince Hughie to cut Butcher loose from the team, but he refuses. Butcher discreetly meets up with Neuman at an abandoned \"Vought Video\" store. Butcher tries to persuade Neuman for a truce that could allow him to get Ryan back and in return, the CIA would give her protection from Homelander and that Hughie's material on her from the Red River Group Home would be destroyed.\n\nSister Sage and Homelander Form an Unlikely Alliance in 'The Boys' Season 4\n\nHughie receives another phone call, where he's told that his father is on life support, causing him to rush to the hospital. At Starlight's House for At-Risk Teens, we meet Annie's associate Colin (Elliot Knight), who was recommended to Annie by Frenchie. Kimiko begins to suspect that Frenchie has feelings for Colin after watching the two interact with one another.\n\nHomelander, disguised in civilian clothing, visits Sister Sage at her home, testing her powers before opening up to her about his unhappiness and feeling of meaninglessness. Sister Sage encourages Homelander to cause civil unrest, causing the humans to begin killing each other and giving him an entry point where he can truly rise to power. Homelander invites Sister Sage to join the Seven, to which she reluctantly agrees. Hughie finds Butcher alone at the Boys' office, where he confides that his father had a stroke and that he didn't pick up the phone when he called right before it happened. Butcher embraces Hughie for the sole purpose of snatching his hard drive containing critical information on Neuman.\n\nTodd Becomes an Unwilling Martyr in 'The Boys' Season 4\n\nMM, Kimiko, and Frenchie embark on a stake-out and find Todd meeting up with two fellow \"Hometeamers,\" outside Planet Vought. The three men are invited in where they are greeted by Homelander, Sage, Black Noir, The Deep, and A-Train. Homelander unveils his plans to use his three top supporters as martyrs and orders his teammates to kill them with baseball bats. While Black Noir and The Deep do this with minimal hesitation, A-Train is more reluctant and stands by as his teammates do the work.\n\nOutside the courthouse where Homelander is standing trying, Sage disguises herself as a \"Starlighter\" as the verdict is revealed to be \"not guilty.\" She proceeds to incite a riot by splashing hot coffee on a \"Hometeamer.\" Frenchie rescues Colin from being attacked by a protester and the two begin to kiss, while Kimiko watches from a distance. A-Train is given orders to drop the corpses of Todd and the other two conspiracy theorists right outside the courthouse to make it seem like they were murdered by Starlighters.\n\nThe episode concludes after the events of the riot, as Ryan confesses to Homelander that he still cares about Butcher and doesn't want him to die. The Deep talks to his octopus lover Ambrosius, voiced by none other than Academy Award winner Tilda Swinton. Frenchie is shown to be in bed with Colin and gets up to look at a picture of Colin's family. Hughie sits by his father's bedside listening to the voicemail he left before being interrupted by his estranged mother (Rosemarie DeWitt). The episode also ends with the revelation that Butcher has been having hallucinations of his late wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten), leading to him having a change of heart about sending Hughie's files to Neuman. Neuman receives a text from Butcher, only to see that Butcher has sent a lewd photo instead.\n\nThe Season 4 premiere may not be as shocking and gross as past season openers, but it doesn't necessarily need to be. Not only does it maintain that fiery and angry satire, but it also maintains its sense of humor and knack for creative violence. Homelander is never not a fascinating character, but Butcher and the team's ongoing quest to take him out could get repetitive very easily. However, the way Kripke is able to raise the stakes all the way to the White House leads us to believe that this may just be the darkest and most politically relevant chapter yet.\n\nREVIEW The Boys\n\nThe Season 4 premiere of The Boys doubles down on the satire and less on the shock while introducing some compelling new plots and characters to this madcap world.\n\n810\n\nProsSusan Heyward's introduction as Sister Sage is a major highlight, showing she may be an effective foil to Antony Starr's Homelander.The satire is as strong as ever, and the political commentary feels incredibly relevant.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Boys Season 4 are now available to stream on Prime Video in the U.S.\n\nWatch on Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType":

Given the show's penchant for shocking twists, dark humor, and a critical take on the superhero genre, season 4 promises to push boundaries even further. With its trademark blend of gritty storytelling, complex characters, and biting social commentary, this season is poised to deliver another compelling chapter. Let's take a peek at some of the spoilers and speculations surrounding season 4 of The Boys.\n\nSeason 3 of The Boys ended with several cliffhangers that set the stage for dramatic developments in the next season. One of the most pressing questions revolves around the fate of Homelander. By the end of season 3, Homelander's public image was at an all-time high despite -- or perhaps because of -- his increasingly unhinged behavior. Speculation suggests that season 4 might explore the consequences of his growing power and influence, potentially leading to a confrontation that could reshape the world of The Boys.\n\nSpeaking of antagonists, we can't forget the rising threat of Victoria Neuman, who is set to be the main antagonist of season 4. Armed with the power of blood manipulation, which she has used to earn the nickname \"Head Popper,\" Neuman now has something more terrifying under her sleeve -- a virus. This virus, which we got a glimpse of in Gen V, was specifically made to be deadly against Supes. While it is stated that the virus is currently not very contagious, it is nonetheless still deadly. However, Neuman may be holding onto it for protection against Homelander, especially after he threatened her daughter's life. But knowing The Boys, things can go very wrong very fast.\n\nThe introduction of new characters has always been a significant aspect of The Boys, and season 4 is expected to continue this trend. One of the most anticipated new characters is Sister Sage, played by Susan Heyward, described as a powerful and enigmatic figure. Her role in the narrative remains shrouded in mystery, but early speculation suggests she could be a formidable ally or adversary to both The Boys and The Seven. We're also expecting to see a few Gen V cameos in the new season.\n\nAnother new character is Firecracker who is set to be joining The Seven. Additionally, fans are eager to see more of Soldier Boy. His arc in Season 3 left many questions unanswered, particularly regarding his connection to the origins of Compound V, and his complex relationship with Homelander. Some theories propose that Soldier Boy could return as a central figure in the battle against Vought International, possibly leading to an uneasy alliance with The Boys.\n\nAnother major plot thread involves the character of Butcher. Season 3 revealed Butcher's terminal illness, a result of his use of Temp V, a temporary compound that grants superpowers. This revelation raises several questions: Will Butcher find a cure? How will his illness affect his vendetta against Homelander?\n\nSome fans theorize that Butcher's desperation might drive him to more extreme measures, blurring the line between hero and villain even further. Moreover, with Butcher's deteriorating health due to Temp V, the show might explore the broader consequences of artificial enhancements, and the moral cost of power. This could also tie into the storyline of Vought's ongoing experiments and the commercialization of Compound V, raising questions about the exploitation of superhuman abilities for corporate gain.\n\nAccording to a spoiler circulating, season 4 will reveal that Butcher had cheated on his wife Becca while they were still together. While some fans speculate that he might have cheated in a metaphorical sense, using Becca as a reason to rampage against supes, others believe that Butcher might have slept with a shapeshifter thinking they were Becca. Regardless of the reasons behind it, the entire fandom agrees that this plotline may potentially ruin Butcher's character development so far.\n\nReturning characters such as Starlight and Hughie are expected to face new challenges. Starlight's departure from The Seven and public stance against Vought set her on a dangerous path, potentially making her a primary target for Homelander's wrath. Meanwhile, Hughie's ongoing struggle with his role in The Boys and his relationship with Starlight will likely be tested further, especially given the ever-present threat of Vought's retribution and his use of Temp V. Nonetheless, there are some speculations that the two will break up, and Hughie will be engaged to another supe by the end of season 4.\n\nAccording to potential spoilers posted by the famous fan account VoughtHq, The Boys are going down a path of separation and they may never get back together. The account hints that The Boys will no longer be on good terms and would say goodbye to each other. Starlight may be behind this, as she is said to allegedly be gunning for Butcher to leave the group. The new element of Compound V being used has also put an evident strain on the group dynamics, and will surely continue to push them to the edge.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "demi_phillips@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Demi Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_commentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social commentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffhanger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cliffhanger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Butcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Butcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Character arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Art_History/Online_Courses", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Art History/Online Courses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Boys-Season-4-Homelander-Antony-Starr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Not on purpose -- showrunner Eric Kripke, articulating a reality of television production, has noted that his narrative plans often precede their real-world parallels -- but the hit Prime Video series has a pretty consistent rep for producing a bloody response to the moment at hand. In its fourth season, the dark satire circles a familiar target, once again arriving in a pivotal election year. Now it's returned to ask if anyone learned anything since the last go round.\n\nUnfortunately, the only clear answers to that question are bad ones in the world of The Boys. Last season ended with Homelander (Antony Starr) lasering a man's head off in public to the cheers of his supporters, signaling a shift in the status quo between the world and the supes that inhabit it. As debauched and amoral as the supes of The Boys have been in the series, they still kept up appearances. They engaged in the theater of being superheroes, noble exemplars there to help their fellow man. But the appeal of playing pretend is losing its luster.\n\nNormal humans, Homelander frequently tells his son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) and himself, are lesser, \"toys for our amusement.\" The ticking time bomb of The Boys, narratively, has been: How long can the show's writers convince us that he is more amused with the normal people committed to ruining his fun?\n\nThis is where some may find exhaustion beginning to creep in, as a show with an antagonist who can credibly eliminate all sources of conflict whenever he chooses continues to, well, not do that. But The Boys has always been a canny show where petty flaws and insecurities drive the action more than big, violent fights, and while season 4 leads with politics, its character work carries the show this year.\n\nIn between the clear parallels to our modern media circus, The Boys takes its time for a renewed focus on its characters, making a point to have everyone articulate what it is exactly that they're fighting for. It can be easy to forget, with all the ass-exploding, genital-forward antics of the show, but it is a story deeply concerned with humanity, and how hard it is to hold on to it in the face of pure uncontested power. At its best moments, season 4 lingers on pairings of fathers and sons or other strained relationships. The strongest divide in the world of The Boys isn't necessarily between the superhuman and not, but who still gives a shit about people, even when there's no incentive to. As The Seven become more depraved under Homelander's unrestrained control, the temptation to meet them in kind remains strong -- even if the Temp V that briefly superpowered The Boys last season is now off the table.\n\nNaturally, Hughie (Jack Quaid) sits at the center of this, as the formerly nervous dweeb is now a seasoned operative in danger of losing the heart that keeps his team grounded. But Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) and Frenchie (Tomer Capone) see their relationship tested, and even those within Vought, like A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) or the beleaguered PR flack Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie) have some contemplating to do as Homelander shakes things up in Supe Camelot.\n\nThe new season is less deft with its political satire, with frankly not enough time in its eight episodes to situate viewers in the world as it stands now (something spinoff Gen V was quite good at). Homelander's trial for killing an innocent man splits the public into Homelander stans and anti-stans -- who take up Starlight (Erin Moriarty) as their figurehead -- but there's no real ideology at play here, just the veneer of team sports. Two new additions to The Seven, Sage (Susan Heyward) and Firecracker (Valorie Curry) gesture at the shifting political landscape, but in a way that feels like a preamble. While what is present makes for a pretty accurate and damning approximation of current U.S. politics, reproduction is not commentary, and unfortunately a season that so successfully refocuses on interpersonal dynamics suffers when its scope widens.\n\nWhat's undeniable is that The Boys' fourth season has doomsday on the mind. As mentioned above, even before the news of next season being its last, there's a ticking clock inherent in its premise. Much like Homelander will eventually tire of whatever restrictions remain on his id, so do all authoritarians in swaying the public toward their view.

Alas, such bragging rights prove more favorable in getting a \"not guilty\" verdict when jurors are mere mortals who the defendant could laser to death with the blink of his eyes, or snap in two with the flick of his wrist. Of course, Homelander is found not guilty.\n\nSeason four of The Boys -- as creator/showrunner Eric Kripke has explained -- reflects even more of the political chaos going on in real U.S. politics today than in previous seasons. \"Did I know it was going to come out during Trump's trial? Of course not. But we write what we're either scared of or pissed off about,\" he said of the show always being about Trumpism. \"The show's many things. Subtle isn't one of them.\"\n\nAnd its core will never change, says Kripke when chatting again with The Hollywood Reporter about the premiere as the Boys, a group of vigilantes, pursue and try to bring to justice to the dangerous, murderous supes (the name for superheroes in the Amazon series).\n\nFresh from being vindicated, an annoyed Homelander tries to adjust to the demands of being a father and is furious with the incompetent remaining members the Seven, his group of elite supe fighters who are the stars of corporation Voight International. Right now there are four -- including himself -- who remain his \"yes men\": The Deep (Chace Crawford); the new Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell), after Homelander killed the original because he never told him that Soldier Boy (Nathan Mitchell) was Homelander's father; and A-Train (Jessie T. Usher).\n\nHe needs three new recruits. One will eventually be his son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti). But he is also facing a vacancy from Starlight, aka Annie, (Erin Moriarty), who left the group and started an anti-Voight, anti-Homelander national grassroots movement called the Starlighters. (Homelander repays Starlight organization for protesting outside of his trial by inviting three of his biggest \"Homelander fans\" to a private meet-and-greet, has members of the Seven kill the fans and then drops their bodies among the \"Starlighters\" crowd to claim they were killed there.)\n\nHomelander's first choice for a new Seven member is a young Black woman from Detroit named Sister Sage (Susan Heyward). The choice of Sister Sage, whose power is to be the smartest person in the world, may seem jarring at first for someone like Homelander, who some audience members have thought of as being racist or a white supremacist, but it makes sense if you think about, says Kripke.\n\n\"It's funny you say that, because Ant [Starr] and I have actually talked about it. And if you look, I mean, he's way more of a supe supremacist than he is a white supremacist,\" Kripke tells THR. \"He just hates humans. But, he loves A-Train. He likes if someone has superpowers, that puts them in a position where he at least doesn't immediately try to murder them. And I think that's Sage.\"\n\nKripke adds, \"He realizes that he's surrounded by idiots. For as big as his ego is, he's not stupid, and he knows that he needs someone intelligent around. And even though the world's smartest person is a lot for his ego to take, and he really struggles with it, he does value her in a way where, as an African American woman who is the smartest person on Earth, I don't think she found as much of that value. People weren't listening to her, which was ironic and frustrating considering how brilliant she was. Homelander was willing to listen, and that's what she needs.\"\n\nIn episodes two and three, the Boys are also dealing with their own personal traumas. Hughie (Jack Quaid) neglects staying in touch with his father, who ends up having a medical emergency and is on life support; Frenchie (Tomer Capone) falls in love with a worker for Starlight's organization who may know about the horrible things Frenchie did in his past; Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) is recklessly living life in denial that she may jealous of Frenchie's new relationship; and Butcher (Karl Urban) is still being a pain to everyone as goes about trying to do something decent before the Temp-V drug he took in season three extinguishes his short life.\n\nAnd then, there's Firecracker (Valorie Curry), who comes in episode two. Ironically, it's Sister Sage who ushers in arguably one of the most dim-witted and racist members of the Seven. How would Kripke describe Firecracker?\n\n\"I think it's like [politicians] Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert,\" he says, offering inspirations. \"When we were writing her, [South Dakota Gov.] Kristi Noem wasn't in our heads, but then she comes out and she's shooting puppies and then it's like, 'There's Firecracker! She's literally shooting puppies!'\"\n\nAnd there you have it. With the new season, The Boys is off to satire what it pleases, while offering some gut-wrenching laughs if Kripke has his way. He says if audience members thought the first three episodes were a rollercoaster ride for season four, prepare to strap in for a rocket launch: It's going to get crazier.\n\n\"I think every episode has at least one totally fucking bananas moment,\" Kripke says. \"I love the ones in episode five. Episode six makes me cover my mouth with my hands every time I watch it; so, I think there's lots of good stuff going on.\"\n\nBut, will it top Herogasm from season three?\n\nKripke releases a big, sly grin, \"Not in the scope of Herogasm. But -- and this was in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler -- Temp V-ed up farm animals is pretty terrific! And Tek Knight (Derek Wilson) taking Hughie down to the Tek Cave and being able to riff on Batman a bit is absolutely delightful.\"\n\nAhead of season four's release, Kripke announced that the already renewed fifth season of the Amazon hit series would be the last.\n\n\"From the very beginning, I wanted to wrap it out around season five,\" Kripke told THR about the decision, calling season four the \"calm before the storm\" that ushers in the big \"climax\" with season five. \"The show is a serialized story that is about Butcher and Homelander slowly crashing into each other, and the show doesn't work without either of those. So, you just can't keep that going on forever, you have to let them smash into each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "demetrius_patterson@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Demetrius Patterson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Mitchell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumpism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parallel universes in fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Chi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

In the fourth season of the white-hot Amazon series, it seems that Starlight isn't alone in joining forces with Butcher, Hughie, and their comrades. The first three episodes are now available to stream on Amazon Video, giving fans a deep dive into the problems facing this fictional United States and how one member of the Seven found themselves at odds with the plans that Homelander was hatching.\n\nWarning. If you have yet to watch the first three episodes of The Boys' fourth season, be forewarned that we'll be diving into some major spoiler territory for the recently release premiere. The sins of the Seven have been taking a heavy toll on almost every member of the superhero group that stand on the top of the ladder in terms of power and popularity. Even Homelander, the nefarious antagonist who seems like a dark reflection of the Man of Steel, is working desperately to hold it together. Unfortunately for Vought, there is one member of The Seven who has had enough and is throwing his lot in with the Boys, as A-Train has become a secret mole in their ranks.\n\nA-Train Crosses The Tracks\n\nThere are several reasons why the Seven's resident speedster has decided to work in the shadows on behalf of the Boys. On top of the remaining guilt he has for accidentally killing Hughie's girlfriend, he is struggling with his role as a hero in the face of his brother and his nephews looking down on him. These facts don't even take into account Homelander's consistent belittling of him, as the head of the Seven even goes so far as to demand that the Deep performs a sexual act on A-Train in one of the creepier moments of the fourth season.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Boys' fourth season are now available on Amazon Prime. The remainder of the season will release one new episode per week, meaning that the season finale will arrive this July. Here's how the streaming service describes this new season, \"The world is on the brink. Victoria Neuman is closer than ever to the Oval Office and under the muscly thumb of Homelander, who is consolidating his power. Butcher, with only months to live, has lost Becca's son as well as his job as The Boys' leader. The rest of the team are fed up with his lies. With the stakes higher than ever, they have to find a way to work together and save the world before it's too late.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_Steel_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Man of Steel Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spoiler (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(animal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mole (animal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Season finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_British_Columbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Victoria, British Columbia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/12/a8a19212-a042-4d76-a850-7336d90f475b/the-boys-season-4.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Lord, help me find the words to describe what I just witnessed. And please, don't blame me for the words you're about to read. A man named Splinter -- who has the power to duplicate himself -- forms a six-person human centipede made entirely of his own clones so that they can all perform oral sex on one another.\n\nI may need to gouge out my eyeballs.\n\nWhile I consider my options, let's talk about episode 2's Will Ferrell cameo. He plays himself, acting in Vought's A-Train-centered origin story film. \"Damn it, Reggie, you're the most talented superhero I've ever seen,\" Ferrell tells A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) when he catches him dealing drugs in the scene. \"Yet you're throwing it all away slinging yayo for gang bangers?\" That's definitely something I never thought I'd hear Will Ferrell say! Sligning yayo for gang bangers. He tells the director that he's hopefully \"not giving off too much of a Blind Side vibe.\" Then, Ferrell leaves (thank god!) without doing any embarrassing sex stuff. If The Boys made me watch Will Ferrell fuck clones of himself, I would have never forgiven them.\n\nMeeting Ferrell has some great ripple effects on A-Train. He's beginning to think differently about the way he uses his powers, especially after the murders he committed for Homelander (Antony Starr) last episode. When A-Train runs into his disappointed brother at the park, it's the final catalyst for him to do some good. \"You never actually saved anyone,\" he tells A-Train. The superhero then gives Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) evidence that frees the accused Starlighters of the murders he committed outside the courthouse. Why did A-Train help The Boys? After three seasons, maybe he's finally feeling guilty.\n\nA-Train isn't the only one. Hughie's estranged mother appears, played by Rosemarie Dewitt (Little Fires Everywhere). She reps Voughtality, some multi-level-marketing-sounding skincare scheme from Vought. \"You know Vought killed my girlfriend, right?\" Hughie asks her. She left them when Hughie was just six years old, but she's back because she has power of attorney regarding his father's incapacitated state. I wonder if that's Simon Pegg lying in that hospital bed, or a well-made mold.\n\nElsewhere, Vought creates an origin story and costume for Homelander's son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), ridiculously naming him \"Homeboy.\" Sage (Susan Heyward) disagrees with their marketing plan. He's the world's first natural born superhero, so his public image should reflect that. Her presence also rubs off on The Deep (Chace Crawford). He begins to demand some respect around Vought, spurred on by Sage's advice and Homelander's influence.\n\nEven though Homelander brought Sage here because he needs her help, he seemingly starts to regret his decision. She plans a staged crime for Ryan to save the day with no casualties. Homelander crashes the event and tells Ryan to murder the actor playing the criminal. \"Accidents happen all the time,\" Homelander tells him. \"Humans are fragile.\"\n\nSage still has yet to explain her motivations for working with Homelander. Is this a joke on her character as \"the smartest person in the world?\" Would the smartest person in the world work with Homelander? I need some more answers here.\n\nBefore The Boys' next mission, Marvin (Laz Alonso) kicks Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) out of the group. He's volatile and untrustworthy. Still, Butcher refuses to leave. He follows them to their next operation at TruthCon, a convention for Homelander's supporters -- which is full of conspiracy theorists and right-wing nut jobs. The Boys attend a panel titled \"Starlight at the Hollywood Pedophile Cabal,\" led by Firecracker (Valorie Curry) -- a new character created for the show. Sage is in attendance, seemingly monitoring all of Vaught's activities moving forward.\n\nAfter Butcher fails to keep himself together and insults Marvin's family, he beats Butcher outside with some heavy punches. \"Just go home man,\" he tells him. Butcher isn't the only one losing his cool at TruthCon. Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) refuses to deal with her past and is triggered by images of children in cages. Frenchie (Tomer Capone) is now romantically linked with a man named Colin (Elliot Knight), after he and Kimiko broke up. The split is affecting her more than she thought it would, in addition to distracting Frenchie from his work with The Boys. Kimiko walks out of therapy and starts pounding beers.\n\nButcher's absence and Kimiko's drunkeness affects the group most when Sage captures The Boys with the help of Splinter (Rob Benedict) and Firecracker. The gang flees into a Marvelous Mrs. Maisel-themed bat-mitzvah occurring next to TruthCon at the hotel, where they fight many nude Splinters. Butcher returns just in time. He helps them escape, incapacitating Firecracker and killing Splinter.\n\nLater, Butcher comes clean to Marvin back at their base. He has six months to live, and he just wants to get Ryan safe and away from Homelander. Shockingly, Marvin doesn't care -- even after Butcher just helped save their asses. \"Too fucking little Butcher,\" he responds. \"Too fucking late.\"", "source": {"uri": "esquire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Esquire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cloning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

An intense sequence at Vought on Ice leads to chaos, with Hughie eavesdropping on a pivotal conversation.\n\nThe wheels have now been set in motion for Season 4 of The Boys, as this chapter of the bloody superhero satire looks to be a major turning point for many of the characters. Episode 3, titled \"We'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here,\" continues to unveil more dark secrets about each of the Boys; in the meantime, the Seven aim to put \"Christ back in Christmas\" in their ice capade spectacular (well, not the real Seven, but you get the point). As Firecracker (Valorie Curry) decides to attack Annie (Erin Moriarty) directly, we begin to learn more about both of the women's beliefs beyond just their thoughts on Vought. There's lots of blood and gore, but also plenty of emotion. In other words, it's par for the course with The Boys.\n\nThe Boys TV-MASuperheroAction Sci-FiDramaCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Main Genre Superhero Seasons 4 Studio Amazon Studios Expand Sister Sage and Firecracker Are Officially Inducted Into the Seven\n\nEpisode 3 begins with a Vought rally hosted by Homelander (Antony Starr), who warns his followers and supporters that Starlight wants to get rid of superheroes and replace \"real Americans\" with a bunch of \"godless, non-binary socialists.\" He promises to protect America before introducing the newest members of the Seven, Firecracker and Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), while also hinting that he plans to induct Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) into the team, referencing the viral video of him accidentally killing the \"bank robber.\" Butcher (Karl Urban) and Kessler (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) watch a telecast of the rally at the former's apartment. Kessler gives Butcher drugs with the intention of sedating Ryan, so he can not only rescue him but also get intel on Homelander. Butcher then reveals his plan to bring him to a safe house set up by Grace Mallory (Laila Robins).\n\nAt Vought Tower, Homelander watches as Firecracker speaks to the press about how vaccines cause autism, leading him to question why Sister Sage advocated for her to be on the team. Sage claims that Firecracker's rhetoric will only make the Hometeamers louder. It is also revealed through their conversation that Sage feels that her being front and center will prevent her from staging any more coups like the one outside of Homelander's trial. At the Starlight House, Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie talk to an adviser about Hughie potentially suing his mother Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt) for power of attorney over his father (Simon Pegg), who is now in a vegetative state. The advisor stresses to Hughie that there's not much he can do and advises him to make amends with his mom. Frenchie (Tomer Capone) attempts to talk to Colin (Elliot Knight), but walks away when a gunman walks into the building demanding the advisor \"free the children from the basement.\" Frenchie responds by knocking out the would-be terrorist. While Colin patches him up in the bathroom, and even though he finally has a private space to talk, Frenchie can't bring himself to tell him the truth.\n\nPresident-elect Robert Singer (Cameron Coleman) talks to his VP Victoria Neuman (Claudio Doumit) about removing Supes from the military and law enforcement, an idea she obviously rejects. Singer retorts by saying that superpowered beings need to go back to being celebrities, instead of interfering with the government and foreign affairs. Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) asks Frenchie to join her in her plot to murder the members of Shining Light, the terrorist group that kidnapped her as a child, and he agrees. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) tells Hughie and Annie that he wants to \"flip\" A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) so that they can use him as a mole to gain intel on Homelander. The two reject the idea, with Hughie stating that he believes that they need to bring back Butcher.\n\nBack at Vought Tower, Ryan plays an Injustice-like fighting game called Vought: Tournament of Heroes (a plea to Amazon, please make this a real thing). He receives a \"battle request\" from Butcher, who talks to him through a Crimson Countess player model. Butcher pleads with Ryan to visit him at his home so they can finally talk and make amends. At Vought Tower, Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) asks Ashley Barret (Colby Minifie) for a sense of direction. Before she can even respond, Homelander demotes her and makes Sister Sage the new CEO of Vought. Sage mocks her by calling her a \"mascot\" on par with Ronald McDonald. Homelander proceeds to ask her to find Ryan.\n\nSage reveals to the team that the footage acquitting the two Starlighters from the murder of the three Homelanders has been stolen, and blames The Deep (Chace Crawford), who has been the head of crime analytics. She then claims Ryan already has offers for superhero teams such as Teenage Kix and Capes for Christ, but this could be derailed by an Anti-Vought social media campaign called #RescueRyan. Ashley Barret vents her frustrations to Vought News anchor Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison), who is revealed to be in a BDSM relationship with her.\n\nButcher Bakes Some Cookies in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 3\n\nAt the safehouse, Butcher bakes cookies laced with drugs to give to Ryan, but he declines them upon his arrival. Ryan accuses Butcher of trying to trick him, but Butcher won't give up, and invites him to play Fussball with him instead. MM tries to coax A-Train into working with the Boys, and attempts to level with him, but is rejected. MM lets A-Train know that he knows he is behind the footage being leaked. Frenchie and Kimiko sneak through Shining Light's safehouse, as the former is revealed to be high. As Kimiko murders the terrorists, Frenchie begins hallucinating the thugs bleeding rubber ducks, bath toys, and bubbles, before hearing Colin's voice talking to him. Frenchie envisions Colin sitting with the corpses of his family, as he also hallucinates the bodies of all the people he has killed over the years.\n\nButcher and Ryan finally seem to be bonding and Ryan's \"save\" is brought up. Ryan confesses that he accidentally killed the man killing the bank robber and that Homelander told him that he shouldn't care. Butcher attempts to comfort him and opens up about his regrets, revealing to him that he's dying, and he's all he has left. Butcher has a change of heart and trashes the cookies, fibbing to Ryan that he put too much sugar in them.\n\nSage and Homelander interrogate a Vought Employee who was an acquaintance of Annie's in the past, who denies that she was close with Annie, but that she did receive a call from her a few days ago. In an act of rage, Homelander lasers her to death. Annie breaks into Firecracker's bedroom in Vought Tower and confronts her about her hatred. Firecracker reveals that she used to compete against her in pageants and that Annie would spread demeaning rumors about her as well as body-shame her. Annie attempts to apologize, but Firecracker brushes her off, claiming that people don't change and that she's the only person who she's Starlight for who she really is.\n\nThe Seven Finds Jesus on Ice in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 3\n\nMM brings Hughie to a rehearsal of Vought on Ice, where a team of costumed figure skaters dressed as the Seven sing about putting \"Christ back in Christmas.\" He tells Hughie that A-Train has informed him that Victoria Neuman will be in attendance with her daughter Zoe. Hughie crawls up into the vents and eavesdrops on Neuman's conversation with Sage and Homelander. Sage promises that she'll take care of Singer for her, so she can rise to become president, and in return, she'll get rid of the \"defund the Supe\" movement and put Supes above the law and the police. They also ask her to go public about her Supe identity, believing that it will get Vought in the public's good graces once more.\n\nA droplet of Hughie's sweat falls on Homelander's shoulder and Homelander detects his presence and begins using his laser vision in retaliation. He misses Hughie but lasers the ice skater playing Queen Maeve in half. Pandemonium erupts as the ice-skaters begin slicing each other's limbs off while trying to escape. Hughie is nearly cornered by Homelander but is saved at the last minute by A-Train. At the Boys' office, Kimiko confronts Frenchie about his continued drug abuse, but he refuses her help, claiming that rehab does not work for him. At the hospital, Hughie talks to Daphne, where she reveals the reasoning behind why she left, claiming that she suffered from severe Post-Partum depression and even by the time she recovered, she was too afraid to go back to her family, believing they were better off without her. She in turn apologizes to Hughie, and the two slowly begin to make amends.\n\nKessler reprimands Butcher for not drugging Ryan. Butcher, now with a renewed sense of fatherhood, feels that Ryan is far too young to become involved in the war on Vought, but Kessler won't hear anything of it. The Deep angrily confronts Sage, who has temporarily deactivated her powers using a metal rod; however, she seduces him and the two begin furiously making out. The episode concludes in Homelander's penthouse, as Homelander finally snaps at Ryan, violently throwing furniture, causing the tween to run away. Homelander begins talking to various reflections about himself, who are each giving him conflicting advice, before advising him to \"go home.\"\n\nThe Boys Season 4 continues to ramp up the tension in this episode as we finally get a better sense of characters' motivations. We also get a sense that Kessler may not be as much of an ally to Butcher as initially expected. While the \"will-he, won't-he\" arc of A-Train was starting to feel a bit repetitive, the final 10 minutes are finally able to set things in stone for viewers. The dynamic between Firecracker and Annie is also quite fascinating and paints a different picture of Starlight's supposedly squeaky-clean past. The Vought on Ice sequence felt like the cherry on top of this blood-soaked cake and provided some much-needed laughs amidst this season's bitter darkness.\n\nREVIEW The Boys\n\nEpisode 3 of The Boys Season 4 continues to raise the stakes to even greater levels while also introducing a new fascinating wrinkle to Annie and Firecracker's arc.\n\n810\n\nProsVought On Ice might not add much, but it sure is entertaining.The reveal that Annie used to bully Firecracker as a child adds an interesting new wrinkle to her character arc. ConsA-Train's will-he, won't-he arc with Mother's Milk was starting to feel a little repetitive, but the episode course-corrects.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Boys Season 4 are now available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nWatch on Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Minifie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colby Minifie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laz_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laz Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safe house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_McElligott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominique McElligott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laila_Robins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laila Robins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorie_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valorie Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aya_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aya Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

This week the first three episodes of the eight-episode season debut; then it's one episode weekly on Thursdays through July 18.\n\nThe extremely gory -- it's often hilariously blood-soaked -- series savagely satirizes right-wing politics and culture wars this season.\n\nHomelander discovers a new ally in Firecracker (Valorie Curry), a right-wing TV news pundit who uses the slogan \"Make America Super Again.\" That fits right in with Homelander's plan to take out anti-supes President-elect Bob Singer (Jim Beaver) and install Vice President-elect Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), a closeted superhero.\n\nTellingly, Homelander's culture warrior shtick doesn't play with the elites who poke holes in his plans for supes domination. But they respond approvingly to Neuman's approach.\n\n\"The masses are [expletive] stupid,\" she says. \"Anyone who owns a 'Live, Laugh, Love' mug shouldn't have a say in how our country is run. People are a labor force that need a kind but firm hand. There are no nations. There's Apple, Exxon and Berkshire Hathaway. Corporations are the real superpowers here. You should be able to operate without any regulation or restrictions. After all, you're billionaires. You're smart enough to know what's best.\"\n\nKripke, the series' creator, has always used \"The Boys\" as a clever ongoing satire of corporate media culture. This season includes a celebrity cameo in a feature film starring A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), one of The Seven's top corporate superheros, and an over-the-top Vought event with ham-fisted attempts at inclusivity.\n\n\"For the first time in Vought history we have two Black heroes in The Seven and one unspecified,\" The Deep (Chace Crawford) says. \"Vought proudly supports and amplifies BIPOC voices.\"\n\nIt's part of a presentation that seems like a cross between a fan event and a network upfront presentation to advertisers where Vought introduces a new initiative, \"Black At It,\" featuring diverse superheroes, prompting The Deep to add, \"Some say 'go woke, get broke,' well, we say, 'go woke, get yoked.' \"\n\n(Vought International is \"The Boys\" universe's corporate punching bag, \"a global leader in the media, retail, energy and pharmaceutical sectors.\")\n\nIn addition to Butcher's interaction with Kessler, this season Butcher is also preoccupied with his own mortality and taking care of Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), his adoptive son, who was born after Homelander raped Butcher's wife. Ryan wavers in his allegiances, shuttling between Butcher and Homelander.\n\n\"The Boys\" is a lot to take and the gore will certainly make it a no-go for some viewers. But from the intricate plotting to the show's knack for parodying already over-the-top American political and cultural touchstones, \"The Boys\" remains unlike any other American series.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_owen@seattletimes.com", "name": "Rob Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead:_Dead_City", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walking Dead: Dead City"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President-elect_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President-elect of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Dean_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Dean Morgan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Beaver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Beaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorie_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valorie Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culture war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeted", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closeted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

This is why that's a good thing. (Prime Video)\n\nThe villainous Homelander is bisexual in source material comics The Boys, but not in hit Prime Video adaptation - and this is why, for once, that might be a good thing.\n\nBased on the comics by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, season four of The Boys dropped on Prime Video on Thursday (13 June). Leading the charge on the side of Vought International (the corrupt company in charge of the very bad superheroes), is Homelander, played by Antony Starr.\n\nIn the TV show, Homelander is too sociopathic to enjoy anything close to what people might call a relationship, but he does have a dalliance with season two's neo-Nazi superhero Stormfront (Aya Cash), including a levitating, electricity-fuelled sex scene or two.\n\nAside from a \"pre-show\" relationship with the bisexual Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott), that viewers never get to witness, the weirdest Oedipus complex you've ever seen, the time he gave himself a blowjob (via shapeshifter Doppelg\u00e4nger) and a PR relationship with Starlight (Erin Moriarty), Homelander's main focus is on retaining power, with no time for any extra-curricular activities.\n\nIn the comics, Homelander has sex with men - a character detail that hasn't (so far) been translated to TV screens.\n\nShort answer: yes. Longer answer: yes, unfortunately.\n\nBy that, we mean that in a Volume Five issue of The Boys, which focuses on a giant superhero orgy called Herogasm, Homelander forces Solider Boy to have sex with him in an attempt to degrade and humiliate him.\n\nIn the comics, Soldier Boy is desperate to join The Seven (Vought's version of the Avengers, so to speak), and views the sex as a sort of audition for Homelander.\n\nAlthough Herogasm was adapted into an episode season three of the TV adaptation, this key plot arc was omitted... thankfully.\n\nSeries creator Eric Kripke has been fairly liberal with his characterisation of the maniacal superhero when compared with the comic book origins. It's beneficial that Homelander's bisexuality has been erased because, although The Boys has a very diverse cast, its only other leading queer character was Queen Maeve, who is \"off-grid\" for the foreseeable future.\n\nHaving the only other example of queerness be murderous psychopath Homelander, who has engaged in sexual violence against other characters, would have done more harm than good for bisexual representation on screen, just like the character himself.\n\nKripke recently confirmed that The Boys would end after season five, so there's still a possibility that Homelander's canonical bisexuality could be explored in the future - but we're certainly not calling for it.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlie_duncan@thepinknews.com", "name": "Charlie Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garth_Ennis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garth Ennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darick_Robertson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darick Robertson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_McElligott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominique McElligott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormfront (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aya_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aya Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus_complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oedipus complex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg\u00e4nger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doppelg\u00e4nger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orgy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fellatio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shapeshifting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Story arc"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Bisexual", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Reviews", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-boys-homelander-bisexual-comics.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 410}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The show's sharpness, wit, and, most of all, audacity have made it a delight. Just because the satire is unsubtle doesn't mean it's unsatisfying.\n\nIn Season 4, which launched with a three-part premiere on Thursday, the satire sticks to the formula. Mostly, it still works. There are few sacred cows the series won't tackle -- at one point, even an actual cow gets torn apart. (OK, a bull, but it's cattle -- close enough.) But consider how the series trains its sights on its first target: the superhero-industrial complex.\n\nIt seems almost unsporting for The Boys to kick Marvel and Hollywood when they're down, but in Episode 5 -- perhaps this season's strongest -- a presenter at a Vought event stands in front of a backdrop studded with dozens of logos for upcoming projects and hypes up a crowd by teasing \"Phases 7 through 19 ... which we'll be sharing with you all today in exhaustive detail.\" Another superpowered star announces, \"It's been a whole year since my last movie, so I'd say we're due for a reboot.\" And then there's the bragging about Vought's diversity campaign -- insensitively dubbed \"Black at It\" -- and jibes about a show reshooting its reshoots and the reboot's \"soundtrack of Nirvana hits and a 12-minute sequence that's entirely pitch black.\" (That Season 4 also features its own Nirvana needle drop -- and a director who remarks that Vought is making a teen show called Super School \"because we like money\" -- shows some winning self-awareness about The Boys' evolution into a blockbuster spinoff factory.)\n\nApologies for explaining the joke, but the humor here lies in how it heightens the truth. Marvel may be prolific, but it hasn't teased Phase 7 yet, let alone 19. And even the conglomerates behind the Batman, Spider-Man, and Superman film franchises generally let at least five years go by before a reboot. When it's making fun of fellow fictional franchises, The Boys ramps up reality exponentially. There's the bigger and broader. And as for the bloodier -- well, there's more of that, too. This season especially, bodies don't bleed so much as they explode, repeatedly dousing the series' antiheroes in the evidence of their deeds.\n\nIt's notable, then, that when fascist superhero Homelander meets the speaker of the House, the Kevin McCarthy equivalent cracks, \"Well, it might've taken 18 rounds of voting, but we got there, didn't we?\" The real McCarthy, of course, was elected as Speaker after 15 rounds of voting. So that's how The Boys skewers that travesty: It tacks on three rounds. Reality, plus a piddling 20 percent.\n\nThe Boys still aims to be bold. But the franchise's satire seems to have met its match in American politics -- and Donald Trump may be its least interesting target. The current, Trump-fueled climate of conspiracy theories and culture wars is so preposterous and sordid that even The Boys can't concoct a much more extreme scenario. You can't top something that's already over-the-top.\n\nThat this is a problem for the country goes without saying. And precisely because it goes without saying, it's also a (much lower-stakes) problem for The Boys that the series nonetheless says it so often. This season is more explicitly, specifically political than ever, which is, well, saying something after Season 3. In the world of The Boys, as in our own, it's a presidential election year. Victoria Neuman, whose tough-on-supes posturing obscures her own status as a secret supe, is the VP-elect. Once her running mate, Robert Singer, is sworn in as commander in chief, a supe will be a heartbeat away from the presidency -- and it won't take Victoria more than a heartbeat to pop the president's head. With that final roadblock removed, President Neuman will be a puppet for Homelander, who's already staged a successful coup at Vought and is looking to level up by cementing his control of the country -- and maybe, then, the world.\n\nWhy do some aspects of this story line seem so tiresome, even as much of the season still thrills? There are a few factors. In part, I'm probably reacting to election-year fatigue. In the way that playing The Last of Us Part II during a real-life pandemic arguably made it more misery-inducing, watching The Boys a few months before November 5 makes its depiction of a Trumpian figure running roughshod en route to the White House extra-exhausting. I suppose one could say that such pop culture clarion calls are \"needed now more than ever,\" but I can't imagine that The Boys will make many viewers reconsider their support of Trump. (At most, it might make some reconsider watching The Boys.) Series creator and showrunner Eric Kripke doesn't disagree: \"It's catharsis,\" he recently told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I have no illusions about my job. ... I am not particularly up my own ass, so I don't know if it'll ever change minds.\"\n\nIn contrast to the actual election, the one on The Boys doesn't seem to have a whole lot riding on it. The series tries to tell us it does, but superpowers trump (sorry) political power, so even if Homelander can't put a pawn in the White House, he'll still be unstoppable. Not only is he invulnerable, but he can fly, shoot deadly lasers from his eyes, and rip people apart with his hands. Politically, he operates with impunity: Homelander starts the season on trial, but unlike Trump, he's acquitted. What does access to the Oval give him that he can't already do? Homelander says he sees humans as insignificant playthings, and in one exchange he tells his son Ryan that he doesn't care about anyone except the two of them. The combination of craving adulation and being uncaring is pretty Trumpian, but there's still something discordant about Homelander simultaneously seeking influence over others and realizing how little he needs them. If Trump could take Compound V, he might not bother running for office.\n\nMost of all, though, the show's political satire this season often falls flat because it isn't satire -- it's imitation verging on transcription.\n\n\"Yes, Homelander on 'The Boys' Is Supposed to Be Donald Trump,\" read the headline on a 2022 Rolling Stone story about Season 3. In typical Boys fashion, the parallels between Trump and Homelander weren't exactly opaque then. Kripke has always considered Homelander a Trump analogue, but in 2022 he told Rolling Stone, \"I'll admit to being a little more bald this season than I have in past seasons.\" If last season seemed on the nose, then now that nose is bleeding because Neuman's squeezing its brain. No one would need a headline now to tell them that Homelander is supposed to be Trump, or that he's the baddie.\n\nLast season, The Boys tried to up Trump's ante. Trump said he could stand on the street and shoot somebody, and he wouldn't lose any voters. Well, what if Homelander did it? (Whatever crimes Trump has committed, he hasn't done that.) That twist yielded the indelible last scene of Season 3, and an omnipresent meme.\n\nIt's hard to up the ante from committing murder in broad daylight and drawing applause. This season, Homelander's cribbing from Trump comes more in the mold of the former (and potentially future) president's plans to consolidate control, gain revenge against his enemies, and detain or deport those he considers undesirable. And last season's nod to Trump's taco bowl was a prelude to numerous digs at Trump and other Republican politicians -- though the show never names the GOP -- that are ripped so straightforwardly from the headlines that creative license (or any kind of creativity) aren't really required.\n\nIn Season 4, Homelander goes on trial in New York, echoes Trump's Charlottesville speech, sells NFTs, promises to make America super again, refers to his supporters as \"patriots,\" and decries the deep state and the woke mob. The speaker refuses to be alone with any woman other than his wife, \u00e0 la Trump's former VP. A new member of the Seven, Firecracker -- a successor to Season 3's Stormfront whose insignia of choice is a Confederate flag instead of a swastika -- peddles conspiracies about pedophiles and Jewish space lasers, bemoans \"critical supe theory,\" announces an interview with Kanye West, and delivers anti-vax, anti-trans, and anti-immigrant screeds. A \"patriot\" in the crowd at a Homelander rally shouts \"string her up\" about Starlight; a line of graffiti reads \"a safe space for libtards.\" Right-wing talking points and buzzwords abound, as The Boys copies and pastes from the zeitgeist, changing one word here or there (or one number, in the case of the speaker's election).\n\nAn authoritarian streak has long run through some superhero stories, which many reevaluations of the medium have noticed and interrogated (see Rorschach from Watchmen). The Garth Ennis comics series that The Boys is based on picked up on that too, but the details were understandably different on the page than they are on the screen. The original tale hails from the comparatively tame time of 2006 to 2012. (Not that it seemed so tame at the time.) \"It's not like you're palling around with Mitt Romney,\" someone says to Neuman this season, drawing a distinction between the man who ran against (Boys fan) Barack Obama and the present threat. \"You're working with Homelander!\" Kripke told Rolling Stone that \"the world is getting more coarse and less elegant,\" and thus The Boys has adapted to it.\n\nSpeaking to THR, Kripke described himself as \"somewhere between a carnie and a court jester,\" affirming that his primary intention is to entertain. But it's challenging to jest about bad things that prominent people are actually saying and doing. And though satire strives to \"hold up a mirror to society,\" its value is limited if that reflection just exposes something we can easily see.\n\nPlus, political commentary isn't a scarce commodity. When The Boys debuted, months after Avengers: Endgame, superheroes' hegemony was at its peak. The Boys felt fresh and vital because it was willing to deconstruct the form. Five years later, that's not unique: Such irreverent takes are so popular -- thanks in no small part to Prime Video -- that the genre may be ripe for a return to tradition. (James Gunn wrote and directed The Suicide Squad, but his new Superman movie seems to be channeling Christopher Reeve more so than Zack Snyder.) Even if we're verging on super-antihero fatigue, though, The Boys is still the best and most subversive of that bunch. There's much more competition when it comes to calling out Trump.\n\n(Maybe it's me, but there's also something slightly suspension-of-disbelief-destroying about the show's frequent references to real-life celebrities and, increasingly, politicians. Season 4 invokes entertainers such as Noah Baumbach and Shia LaBeouf; Will Ferrell makes a cameo as himself. Fine: Ferrell is funny, as are the tossed-off references to the Deep's acting career. But the name-drops in the political realm fly as fast as Homelander, from Mike Lindell and Rick Santorum to Elizabeth Warren and AOC. Is this series set somewhere in the multiverse? In a world rife with sociopathic superheroes, where Lindell is still rich and famous for selling pillows? What about the butterfly effect?)\n\nBy and large, The Boys is still a blast. Even after three seasons of desensitization, the violent or sexual set pieces sometimes make me gasp (or gag). There are a lot of laugh lines -- one of the best being, \"This man is in no condition to fuck a sheep,\" the context for which I won't explain. And although this season is somewhat overstuffed with subplots -- and characters, including the best new addition, the Seven's super-smart mastermind, Sister Sage -- I still care about the Boys. Throughout this season, the group's members confront their past sins and try to find forgiveness, whether from others or (even more daunting) themselves. (\"It's so easy to become a monster around here,\" Ashley Barrett says about Vought, but the same applies to the Boys -- and Washington, D.C.) Boys superfan Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a new character who acts as the devil on the dying Butcher's shoulder, while Butcher's ex-wife Becca, from beyond the grave, acts as the angel. But by far the most affecting arcs belong to Hughie and his parents, and Frenchie and Kimiko. Bleak as the Boys' backstories are -- not to mention their present mental states! -- I look forward to time with them more than I do updates on the quasi-Republican cabal.\n\nAs always, the season ends with a spectacular climax that promises to raise the stakes and deepen the depths of depravity. But I'm glad The Boys is ending after five seasons, before it can become a caricature of itself. There are only so many times Antony Starr's jaw and cheek can twitch as Homelander hears a high whine and barely restrains himself; that the Boys can improbably escape destruction by their superpowered opponents; that Butcher can wrestle with where to draw a moral line in his fight for humanity; that Hughie and Co. can be disappointed by one of Butcher's betrayals. Or that Homelander can take a page from Trump's playbook.\n\nArmando Iannucci, the creator/director of political satires The Thick of It, In the Loop, The Death of Stalin, and Veep, has very often opined that Trump is as impervious to satire. \"Satire or comedy is about exaggeration, distortion,\" he said in 2019, to explain why he'd turned down offers to make a movie about Trump. \"But that's what Donald Trump does. ... He's a self-basing satirist. He is parodying himself.\"\n\nIt's not the fault of The Boys that Trump is so satire-proof -- that although you can imitate him, you can hardly make him seem more selfish, dangerous, or absurd than he is on the surface. Trying to take him down via shame, scorn, or satire is like trying to trade punches with Homelander: Neither one will be wounded, and they'll both wriggle out of the jam. There's still a place for politics in fiction, and in comedy -- but the latter, Iannucci notes, works best when its practitioners fuse jokes and journalism in John Oliver mode. The Boys isn't quite equipped for that kind of comedy. \"We're angrier and more scared as the years go on, so that is just being reflected in our writing,\" Kripke explained in 2022. The Boys does well with anger and fear: Butcher takes a piss on his dad's coffin. But even he can't take the piss out of today's politics.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lindbergh@theringer.com", "name":

Homelander's training of Ryan leads to deadly consequences. Firecracker introduces conspiracy theorists to the series, and an intense fight scene at TruthCon ensues.\n\nThe Season 4 premiere of The Boys sets up quite a few new obstacles for our favorite foul-mouthed group of anti-capitalist vigilantes. After having hallucinations of his deceased wife Becca (Shantel VanSanten), Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) has decided against helping VP-elect Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit), which would have had him double-cross Hughie (Jack Quaid). Speaking of Hughie, he's been dealing with his own issues after learning that his father (Simon Pegg) is on life support after suffering from a severe stroke, and to make matters even more complicated, his estranged mother Daphne (Rosemarie DeWitt) has decided to re-enter the picture.\n\nMeanwhile, Frenchie (Tomer Capone) has reconnected with Colin (Eliot Knight), and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) senses that something more romantic is going on between them. Annie (Erin Moriarty) is now running a center for at-risk Teens, having become a reluctant political activist, but still wants to shed her Starlight persona. As for the Seven, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with Homelander's (Antony Starr) sociopathy, The Deep (Chace Crawford) has been having a secret affair with an octopus (Tilda Swinton), and Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) is somehow still alive. Homelander has also recruited a new member of the Seven, Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), a Supe who's the world's smartest person. Sage assisted Homelander in staging a riot outside his court trial, which involved using three of his biggest supporters as martyrs.\n\nThe Boys TV-MASuperheroAction Sci-FiDramaCrime\n\nA group of vigilantes set out to take down corrupt superheroes who abuse their superpowers.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2019 Creator Eric Kripke Cast Karl Urban , Antony Starr , Erin Moriarty , Dominique McElligott , Laz Alonso , Chace Crawford , Colby Minifie , Aya Cash Main Genre Superhero Seasons 4 Studio Amazon Studios Expand A-Train Gets Blind Sided by Will Ferrell in 'The Boys' Season 4, Episode 2\n\nSeason 4, Episode 2, titled \"Life Among the Septics\" begins with Notorious B.I.G.'s \"Hypnotize\" playing in the background as we see shots of an urban neighborhood. A car pulls into the parking lot of a low-income housing project and out walks none other than Will Ferrell as \"Coach Brink,\" trying to convince A-Train to come back home with him and to get out of the hood. Filmmaker Adam Bourke (P.J. Byrne) yells \"Cut,\" and waltzes his way over to Ferrell, hyping him up by proudly proclaiming that he's on his way to giving an Oscar-winning performance. His conversation with A-Train is less enthusiastic, as the speedster Supe is uncomfortable with the movie's script as it's full of inaccuracies about his life and portraying his brother as a drug dealer. Black Noir also happens to be on the set of the movie, and somehow he's talking, clearly a different person than who he was before.\n\nAt the hospital, Annie sits at the bedside of one of her associates who was attacked by Hometeamers during the riot outside Homelander's trial. She watches a Vought News show on TV claiming that two Black men are the ones responsible for the deaths of the three Hometeamers used as political martyrs. Hughie sits in his father's hospital room, confronting his mother, who is now revealed to be working with Vought as a \"Voughtality Consultant.\" Daphne confesses to a perplexed Hughie that his father had reconnected with her over the past two years and updated his will, giving her the power of attorney, leading Hughie to angrily leave the hospital suite.\n\nKimiko is shown attending a speech therapy session but storms out when the therapist asks her about her parents. She walks into the Boys' office, where Butcher finally tells his teammates that he's dying and has been having hallucinations. Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) pulls him aside and fires him from the team, claiming that he's become a liability.\n\nAt Vought Tower, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), Sister Sage, Homelander, and Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie), listen to a pitch, presenting Ryan with his first superhero costume and his name, \"Homeboy.\" While Homelander and Ashley are thrilled by the pitch, Sage claims that if Vought wants people to truly look up to Ryan, he needs to stand on his own as the first naturally-born Supe. Ashley has become increasingly jealous of Homelander's allyship with Sage and confronts her in the elevator. Their conversation is disrupted by The Deep, who pitches to Ashley that he will show up at Ryan's first \"save,\" something she turns down, but Sage encourages him, telling him to stop acting submissive towards Ashley.\n\nThe Boys Go To TruthCon in Season 4, Episode 2\n\nMM informs the Boys about Sister Sage, having tracked down her coordinates at a Vought-owned hotel. Hughie and Annie stay behind, the latter believing that A-Train was the one responsible for the deaths of the three Hometeamers. Ryan has begun rehearsing his first \"save,\" with The Deep and Black Noir in attendance. During a break, the Deep begins harassing Ashley, threatening her status.\n\nMM, Kimiko, and Frenchie arrive at the hotel where they find Butcher, who finds a way to still tag along as a \"private citizen.\" The four of them then attend a conspiracy theorist convention known as TruthCon, where Kimiko begins to have flashbacks of her childhood, where she was forced to fight other children. Butcher, MM, and Frenchie attend a panel called \"Starlight and the Hollywood Pedophile Cabal,\" hosted by the alt-right Supe and internet personality Firecracker (Valorie Curry). MM has Frenchie follow Firecracker's right-hand man, Splinter (Rob Benedict) and, while walking the convention floor, bumps into a drunken Kimiko, who tries to encourage him to get with Colin, which he rebuffs, claiming their relationship is far more complicated. The two sneak into the sauna, where they find Splinter and his duplicates eating each other out while one of them pleasures himself to a photo of Firecracker.\n\nHughie and Annie spy on A-Train from their car, where Annie confides to her boyfriend that she is uncomfortable that her followers still use her Vought-owned superhero name, Starlight. Hughie gives her a pep talk, claiming that her followers view the name as a symbol and that it might be best for her to embrace it, even if she doesn't want to. The two watch A-Train talking to his nephews, who are soon interrupted by his brother Nathan (Christian Keyes), chastising A-Train for lying to his nephews about being a superhero and saving people.\n\nSage meets up with Firecracker, as Butcher and MM eavesdrop from a distance. Sage, trying to recruit her, questions her reasoning for spreading misinformation, to which she responds that she is giving the \"unrepresented and unrecognized\" a feeling of greater purpose. Butcher wants to intervene, but MM pulls him outside, berating him for constantly breaking the rules for his own gain and putting those he's close to in harm's way. Kimiko attacks a conspiracy theorist manning a booth about child trafficking, criticizing him for ignoring the real victims of child trafficking and instead making up and spreading conspiracies.\n\nHughie and Annie return to The Boys' office, where they find A-Train waiting for them. He gives them a flash drive containing the security footage that will acquit the two Starlighters accused of killing the three Hometeamers during Homelander's trial. When they question why he wants to help them and go against Vought, he thanks the two for not interrupting him when he was with his brother and nephews earlier that day. Homelander, despite Ryan's wishes, interrupts his first save, encouraging him to throw the actor playing a criminal. Ryan reluctantly does, launching the actor into a building and instantly killing him. Ryan, having not intended to kill the actor, is visibly shocked, while his father praises and congratulates him.\n\n'The Boys' Season 4 Introduces Us to the Marvelous Mrs. Firecracker\n\nFrenchie, Kimiko, and MM meet up with Firecracker, Sister Sage, and Splinter in an empty convention hall, where Sage tells Firecracker that they are CIA and that she needs to kill them to win Homelander's approval. Splinter begins to duplicate, which starts a fight that carries over to a young girl's Marvelous Mrs. Maisel-themed Bat Mitzvah next door. Splinter and his naked duplicates begin wreaking havoc on the party, attacking Frenchie, Kimiko, and MM. Firecracker livestreams the event on her social media, claiming that she is being attacked by Zionists. Butcher makes his way into the room, finally killing Splinter, much to the shock of Firecracker, who flees the scene.\n\nLater that night at Homelander's penthouse, Homelander attempts, in his own sadistic way, to comfort a devastated Ryan, telling him that \"you can't save them all.\" When Ryan questions the purpose of superheroes and that he doesn't want to try to do a save again, Homelander becomes angry, telling him that he is \"destined for so much more.\" After Hughie's encouragement, Annie decides to reclaim her Starlight moniker, much to the excitement of her followers. Frenchie connects with an old friend when he talks about Colin, where it's revealed that his reluctance to pursue a relationship is because he killed his family, something that he has never been able to get over himself.\n\nHughie storms into his father's hospital suite, where he angrily recounts to Daphne how she abandoned him as a child. Before he leaves the suite, Hughie threatens his mother that he'll take her to court over gaining power of attorney. Kimiko discovers that the terrorist group that kidnapped her as a child, Shining Light, has a base in New York City, leading her to go on a solo mission. Butcher arrives soon after, and MM thanks him for saving them from Firecracker and Splinter. Butcher opens up about his regret over all the messes that he has created and his devastation that he is unable to fix any of it before his inevitable death. He pleads with MM, who rejects the possibility of Butcher rejoining The Boys.\n\nAfter a relatively tamer start (at least by The Boys standards), the second episode of Season 4 jumps right back into the darkly comic and explicit action sequences that have always made the series feel so special. The political commentary is still there, clear as day, but it never once feels forced, and feels completely natural with the story and even the action setpieces. Firecracker's introduction as an alt-right commentator is another major highlight, with Curry having no issues leaning fully into the character's lunacy while still feeling incredibly real. A-Train seems to be finally getting his face-turn this season, something that has felt like a long time coming. He's done a lot of damage to the Boys -- he's the entire reason Hughie has even gotten into this mess -- but Kripke and Usher clearly see that there's enough there where he can be somewhat redeemed. This episode proves that the series has not missed a step.\n\nREVIEW The Boys\n\nEpisode 2 of The Boys Season 4 leans into the crude and explicit action that has made the show such a hit while also finding clever ways to scrutinize conspiracy theorists.\n\n810\n\nProsValorie Curry is outstanding as Firecracker, fully embracing her character's delusional nature yet still feeling completely real.The Mrs. Maisel-themed fight is the best setpiece of the season yet, retaining the series' signature sense of humor and knack for violence.\n\nThe first three episodes of The Boys Season 4 are now available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nWatch on Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigilantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vigilantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Urban", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Urban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Minifie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colby Minifie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laz_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laz Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

The departure of heroes like Starlight (Erin Moriarty) and Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) has given Homelander (Antony Starr) leeway to do whatever he wants. No one within the Seven has the guts to stand up to him anymore, as heroes like the Deep (Chace Crawford) and Black Noir (who mysteriously returns after being disemboweled by Homelander at the end of Season 3) have been reduced to henchmen status.\n\nIt's everything a megalomanic Superman stand-in could possibly want. Hilariously, however, Homelander actually hates it. That leads him to recruit a new member of the Seven, one whose subtle powers threaten Homelander's own supremacy.\n\nHaving conquered Vought, Homelander now wants to conquer America, and he realizes he needs someone on (or above) his level to do it. So he visits Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), a new candidate for the Seven. She doesn't seem to have any physical superpowers, but what she lacks in strength or invulnerability, she more than makes up for with her infinite intellect.\n\nSage is literally the smartest person in the world and possibly the only person who can bring Homelander's vague aspirations to fruition. Before he can recruit her to the Seven, however, Sage has to prove how smart she is, which she does effortlessly by pointing out Homelander's latest insecurity.\n\n\"You've got a lot of power,\" Sage says, \"but you do age.\" Not only does she clock that Homelander's hair is greying and his prostate is swelling, but she ties all that stress to his encounter with Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles) in Season 3. Her intellect obviously goes beyond this particular \"party trick,\" but The Boys makes a clever choice in tying her powers to another, better-known genius: Sherlock Holmes.\n\nWhat sets Sherlock apart from other high-IQ heroes is his fondness for deductive reasoning. He's typically able to \"guess\" things about people after taking a quick glance at their clothing, posture, or skin. Most adaptations already depict this skill as a kind of superpower: see Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes or the BBC's much-memed modern-day reboot. That The Boys has turned deduction into an actual superpower (or, at least, the manifestation of one) is clever. By making Sage a modern Sherlock, the series creates an effective shorthand. We don't waste much time wondering how smart Sage actually is -- and neither does Homelander -- which means the unlikely duo can get on the same page that much faster.\n\nSage might be the most interesting addition to the Boys-verse, if only because she brings nuance to a show that otherwise lacks ambiguity. In just one episode, she's established as Homelander's most valuable ally, someone who can turn the nation into the supe-first empire he dreams of. That essentially makes her Homelander's evil campaign manager, which may be enough to give him an edge over the Boys.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_McElligott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dominique McElligott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherlock Holmes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Ritchie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guy Ritchie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Ackles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Ackles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deductive reasoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherlock (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Youth and High School", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Art_History/Online_Courses", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Art History/Online Courses", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/12/6571eca6/thby_s4_ut_402_220929_savjas_00323_r1_crop_3000.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

However, some viewers may be disappointed by Anika's (Ana Sani) season 4 fate.\n\nThe Boys season 4 recently enjoyed its three-episode premiere, kicking off with Homelander's (Anthony Starr) trial for murder. Homelander is as unhinged and manic as ever in his desperation to escape consequences for his actions and preserve his quickly disintegrating public image. Meanwhile, The Boys have found a new leader in Mother's Milk \"M.M.\" (Laz Alonso) but are still struggling to shake Butcher's (Karl Urban) influence. On top of that, Victoria Nueman (Claudia Domit) is speeding towards the Oval Office, much to the dismay of the vigilantes.\n\nSeason 4 also quickly introduces a new supe, Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), to shake things up within the Seven. Amid the mix of new and returning characters, viewers will spot Anika. While she has played a relatively minor role in The Boys, viewers were eagerly awaiting her potential return in the new season.\n\nAnika has appeared sporadically in The Boys and garnered quite a following for her subtle acts of resistance and notably awkward confrontations with the Seven's supes. Not much is known about her personal life, but at Vought International, she works as an analyst in the Crime Analytics department. Anika made her debut in season 1, episode 2, \"Cherry,\" in which Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) seeks her aid in finding Translucent (Alex Hassell).\n\nIt's not long before she has her first encounter with Homelander, who also wants an immediate update on Translucent despite Stillwell discouraging him from finding the supe himself. A visibly uncomfortable Anika suggests they get approval from Stillwell, causing Homelander to remind her that he's the Homelander and can do \"whatever the f**k\" he wants. In season 2, she has another awkward encounter when Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) silently appears at her desk and hands her a piece of paper that says \"Butcher.\" Anika is again hesitant to share her information with the supe, but Noir continues silently hovering by her desk until she relents and finds the last known footage of Butcher.\n\nAnika also has an affinity for Almond Joys and is often seen munching on them at her desk. Interestingly, Almond Joys are also Starlight's (Erin Moriarty) favorite candy bar and Noir's kryptonite due to his nut allergy. Many viewers hoped that Anika would end up either intentionally or unintentionally bringing about Noir's demise with her Almond Joys, but The Boys chose not to go that route. However, eventually, Anika and Starlight would boast a connection that went beyond their love of Almond Joys.\n\nIn season 3, Anika starts taking a more rebellious route when she helps Starlight track down Solider Boy (Jensen Ackles). Later, she deleted footage that proved Maeve (Emma Mackey) survived Soldier Boy's attack, thus allowing her to live a life in secrecy, safe from Homelander after faking her death. These small acts of rebellion against Homelander and the Seven only further proved that Anika was the real MVP of Vought International.\n\nSpoilers for season 3, episode 4 of The Boys ahead\n\nOur favorite Vought analyst returns in The Boys season 4, episode 3, \"We'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here.\" However, viewers may be disappointed by the outcome of Anika's appearance. In the episode, Homelander, Sister Sage, and Ashley (Colby Minifie) interrogate Anika about her connection to Starlight. Initially, the analyst denies having anything to do with the ex-Seven member, claiming they only ever shared an Almond Joy together.\n\nWhen Sister Stage reveals that they know she made a recent phone call to Starlight, Anika lies and claims she was just donating some clothes. Homelander continues pushing her to tell the truth, swearing on his son's life that no harm will come to her if she does. She begins to confess, stating that Starlight had requested her help tracking something. Before she can reveal what or who she is tracking, Homelander kills her instantly with the laser beams from his eyes, leaving Ashley and Sister Sage shocked and horrified.\n\nUnfortunately, Anika's story has come to an end on The Boys. While viewers would've loved to see her join The Boys or take on a bigger role in the show, her demise demonstrates that no one at Vought International is safe from Homelander.

Showrunner Eric Kripke reshuffles the series' deck but deals out eerily similar hands in these three episodes. Billy Butcher's (Karl Urban) crew hatches schemes to terminate Homelander (Antony Starr). New caped allies fill empty slots in The Seven, aligning themselves with Homelander's #SupeLivesMatter agenda. If you're still enamored by The Boys and its \"M for Mature\" take on spandex-clad commentaries, rest assured - you'll still savor the same flavors. For those who felt betrayed by Season 3's finale? Or complain The Boys is losing momentum? Season 4 won't do anything to assuage your frustrations.\n\nButcher's behavior throughout Episodes 1-3 is the only aspect that suggests The Boys can learn new storytelling tricks. Can a terminal diagnosis soften his merciless and bloody-knuckled brash personality? A more compassionate Butcher is a welcome diversion for Urban, who capitalizes on opportunities for his performance to color outside the British brawler's outlines. Butcher chooses not to betray his teammates, and affectionately converses with Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) over foosball instead of force-feeding him sedative-laced cookies. Butcher's mortality ushers in a tingle of regret for his past actions, and sees him try empathy on for size. He's still the same Butcher who barbarically impales a supe henchman's head on a crowbar, but now with moral fibers that make us believe even the nastiest bastards can change. We'll see if Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Joe Kessler ruins Butcher's redemption arc. In this version of the story, Kessler is an old agency ally of Butcher's, who encourages his meaner, scorched-earth tactics, not his newfound sympathies.\n\nParallels between bitter rivals stay strong in Season 4. Both Butcher and Homelander confront death - Homelander just spirals infinitely harder. Episodes 1-3 capture Homelander's mid-life crisis like the gray pubic hairs in his secret, sealed jar. Starr's performance flexes spontaneous evils with usual excellence, but so far in Season 4, it's more about what goes unsaid. Homelander's Aryan-ass Superman gets caught staring into voids, the only audible sound a faint tinnitus pitch as a glazed-over Starr gazes ahead like a defeated statue. Homelander's obsession over his everlasting legacy, Ryan's Mini-Me upbringing, and a \"purified\" world where supes enslave humanity nudges him closer to catastrophic breaking points. We'll be rewarded someday with Starr's full-blown psychotic meltdown, and it'll be glorious - but Kripke sure is taking his damn time.\n\nButcher's cohorts seem overwhelmingly distracted by internal demons at the start of Season 4. There's no easing into MM's (Laz Alonso) stint as The Boys' captain - he's immediately distressed by the position's hardships. Frenchie (Tomer Capone) falls in love with an ex-assassination target's all-grown-up orphan son, who, in an added complication, happens to be working at Annie January's (Erin Moriarty) Starlight House headquarters. Hughie (Jack Quaid) can't catch a break when a stroke puts Hugh Sr. (Simon Pegg) in the hospital, which feels cruel at this point given everything Hughie's endured (it's still nowhere near what he endures in the comics, but still.). Kripke jumps back into the proverbial shit feet-first, which feels like overkill, even over a three-episode premiere. The show's repetitive structure doesn't hide, dampening and darkening The Boys' moods before there's even a chance to suggest alternatives.\n\nVought International's ranks don't fare much better, succumbing to their own predictable patterns. Like I said in my spoiler-free Season 4 review, Firecracker (Valorie Curry) is Alex Jones, X-Men's Jubilee, and Stormfront all rolled up into a camo-wrapped package. Comparisons between Curry's grossly antisemitic conspiracy slinger and Stormfront make the ditzy Vought mouthpiece feel too obvious an addition to the main ensemble. Vought's acting CEO, Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie), is again belittled by Homelander and The Seven - but quitting Vought under Homelander's regime is a death wish. The Deep (Chace Crawford) abuses the same emotional cycle, demanding worth not from his octopus lover Ambrosius, but from colleagues who treat him like garbage. Speedster A-Train's (Jessie T. Usher) doublecross against Vought is a juicy development, though - he's bound to be found out, and it'll be exciting when he is. The other members of The Seven are starting to feel more like cutout props behind Homelander, so A-Train's legitimate heroism is a forgiving touch.\n\nBrainiac Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) is the far more fascinating addition to the team, handpicked by Homelander thanks to her superhuman intelligence. Sister Sage asks Firecracker what the pedo-accuser is selling her audience, and the exchange perfectly assesses both characters. Firecracker's fraudulent leadership is exposed when she answers \"a purpose,\" something Joe Six-Pack can believe so he feels significant, while Sister Sage displays her unique ability to logic past carefully market-tested supe facades. Sister Sage immediately establishes herself as a frontrunner for Season 4 MVP with the way her blunt truths challenge Homelander's ego - something his sycophantic followers can't muster.\n\nBut don't despair, sickos and freaks: There's still plenty of indecent action spectacles on display, too. Episode 2 crashes a Marvelous Ms. Maisel bat mitzvah celebration with gunfire and swingin' dongs (Supernatural regular Rob Benedict plays said dong-swinger), Episode 3 unleashes Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) on Shining Light footsoldiers as Frenchie hallucinates rubber duckies, and there's even a revolting Human Centipede recreation (the slurping sounds [shivers]). Bless Will Ferrell's hilarious awards-bait cameo, Vought's Mortal Kombat ripoff (Lamplighter's Fatality is a gory delight), and especially Vought's holiday ice show, as Homelander amusingly lasers a figure skater in half while she's singing about keeping \"Christ\" in \"Christmas.\" Kripke excels at plastering a stupid smile on our faces, and that depraved juvenility keeps Season 4's first few episodes afloat.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score":

The complete eight-episode season will continue to drop weekly every Thursday through July 18. The show has already been renewed for a fifth and final season.\n\nSpeaking with ET, Starr mused on what Homelander's endgame might look like.\n\n\"I'm a bit of a weirdo, I like sometimes seeing the bad guys win,\" Starr admitted. \"I'm not always a fan of the good guy always winning.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I think in this case, Homelander's so bad and I think, I don't know, I don't think the message of the show is about bad guys winning.\"\n\nAs for how he could hypothetically meet his match, Starr mused that his character \"probably should die.\"\n\n\"Maybe suicide by sun,\" he speculated, before shifting gears to suggest that perhaps Homelander should be killed by his on-screen son or his nemesis, Billy Butcher (Karl Urban).\n\n\"The whole show started with Butcher wanting to take down Homelander,\" he said, adding an important caveat. \"I mean, that's Antony with no knowledge of what's coming.\"\n\nFor now, fans can expect to see plenty of banter between Starr's Homelander and Crawford's The Deep.\n\n\"We have so much fun doing it,\" Crawford said of the duo's scenes.\n\nAsked to sum up the season in three words, Erin Moriarty (Starlight), Karen Fukuhara (Kimiko) and Claudia Doumit (Victoria) were in complete agreement on the phrase, \"Wow, such pain.\"\n\nFor Moriarty's Starlight aka Annie, the 29-year-old actress hinted that fans will see her frustrations with the men surrounding her reach a tipping point this season.\n\n\"I think that she's stronger than everyone gives her credit for,\" Moriarty said. \"She symbolizes what a lot of us might feel as women in an industry or in a world where there are expectations set and we feel like we have to prove to someone via action that we are stronger than they anticipate.\"\n\nShe added, \"This season [Starlight] is catching up to the fact that everyone around her has expected less of her to such a substantial degree, that she keeps fighting the good fight and that takes a lot. ... We're gonna see that get to her.\"\n\nMeanwhile, newcomers Valorie Curry (Firecracker) and Susan Heyward (Sage) offered a tease of what to expect from their characters in this \"grotesque\" new season.\n\n\"I love to think of Sage as someone with incredibly complex superpower reign,\" Heyward offered. \"She's able to take an infinite amount of information and strategize around an infinite amount of possibilities, so she very confidently she knows what to do and when to do it.\"\n\nAs for Firecracker, Curry said, \"She's a former pageant girl-turned-podcast host. ...

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?\n\nFOR THREE SEASONS, Prime Video's The Boys has served as an important foil to the Marvel Industrial Complex as both Marvel and DC experience growing pains with their film and television releases. Based on the comic book series of the same name from Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, The Boys follows a ragtag group of the same name that covertly (and not-so-covertly) fights against superheroes who frequently abuse their powers. The Boys has successfully parodied the idea of superhero-powered content through Vought International -- the corporation which runs The Seven (the main group of superheroes, based on DC's Justice League) and markets superheroes throughout media.\n\nThe show has done more than just look at the ways we idolize those in power. So far, over the course of three seasons (and a spinoff, Gen V), showrunner Eric Kripke has cast a sharp look at modern American politics, ranging from the Trumpian figure of Homelander (Antony Starr) to scheming politician Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit). And all that cultural commentary doesn't take anything away from the absurd humor, cartoonish hyperviolence, and frankly pretty queer relationships that help build the heart and soul of the show out.\n\nIt makes sense that everything begins (and potentially will end) with Hughie Campbell (Jack Quaid) -- the everyman who ends up getting into the vigilante group known as The Boys after his girlfriend is accidentally killed by one of the Seven, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher). He's brought into the fold by Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), a foul-mouthed loose cannon with a cockney accent and a ton of charisma -- and that's just the beginning of their fraught relationship.\n\nAs for the rest of the gang, Frenchie (Tomer Capone) has been brought on after Butcher and Hughie kidnap Translucent, an obnoxious member of The Seven with the power of invisibility, after Butcher and Frenchie went their own ways years ago. After the death of Translucent (Hughie kills him the only way possible to breach his impenetrable skin: by detonating an explosive shoved up his butt), Frenchie decides to stick around even after Butcher wants to bring on their other old associate, Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso), whom he does not get along with. But after they track A-Train's devices together, they solve their differences. There's also Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara), perhaps the character who has evolved the most since her Season 1 introduction. She's found in a Triad hangout, initially known just as \"The Female.\" When Frenchie releases her, she kills her entrappers and escapes. M.M. finds evidence that she's a test subject. Both Frenchie and M.M. work to find out her history -- learning her name is Kimiko and that she was kidnapped and tested on by the Shining Light Liberation Army, giving her powers of superstrength and Deadpool-esque regeneration.\n\nThroughout all this, one of the most important discoveries is Compound V -- a drug they learn A-Train is taking while spying on him. Basically, Compound V is a drug that can turn ordinary human beings into superheroes. But for A-Train it essentially works as a steroid, and one that later causes him to have a heart attack and go into cardiac arrest later in Season 1 (he feels he's slipping in his performance, and with major races coming up doesn't want to risk losing his title as fastest man alive. Because, obviously, that just can't happen. Imagine if The Flash lost to some dude?).\n\nKeep in mind, Compound V remains incredibly important throughout the series, and Season 1 reveals that the drug was given to pregnant women to create \"supes\" at random since the '70s.\n\nSeason 1's insight into the workings of The Seven comes via Annie January (Erin Moriarty) who plays Starlight, a new superhero introduced into the Vought Industries group after the retirement of Lamplighter (another piece of work we eventually meet in Season 2). Her introduction to the Vought world isn't good -- fellow supe The Deep (Chace Crawford) sexually assaults her and she tells him she'll kill him if he tries anything with her again. She stops a rape from happening and gains support for that, but she's struggling with having to shill the Vought agenda. She meets Hughie by happenstance, and the two emotionally connect which later leads to a romantic relationship.\n\nAnnie's assault by The Deep eventually gets taken seriously and he's made to publicly apologize before being shipped off to Ohio for a sabbatical where he himself then gets sexually assaulted by a fan. After that, he's not allowed back into The Seven, and loses it. Speaking of losing it, Homelander perhaps had already lost it when we meet him in Season 1. He starts not one, but two plane crashes in the season -- the second with Queen Maeve (Dominique McElligott) which he later uses as a political angle to push for militarized Supes. He also kills Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue), one of Vought's executives, when he's made angry that she's kept a secret from him (this is a major moment in his sociopathy, as Homelander's entire All-American backstory sold to the public was a lie; he was created and raised in a lab, and Stillwell was the closest thing he ever had to a mother... which made their sometimes romantic (?) relationship even stranger). That secret leads to a big reveal between Homelander and Butcher, explaining much of Butcher's constant push to destroy superheroes: Homelander raped Butcher's wife, Becca, and then she disappeared, and is presumed dead. Her disappearance however is revealed that she was sent away because she was pregnant with Homelander's child.\n\nButcher's revelation that Becca has been held by Vought to raise Homelander's child just adds fuel to the fire between The Boys and the Supes going into Season 2. After everything Annie has gone through with Vought, she now works as a double agent, feeding information to The Boys. This season, the gang is no longer the ragtag bunch they were before -- they've got an organized and concerted effort in place to take Vought down. There's an unknown assassin on the loose, who they later learn is Kimiko's brother, but is murdered by a new member of The Seven, Stormfront (Aya Cash). More on her later. Compound V remains a big issue, with Annie leaking to the media that it's responsible for the powers of Supes. However, when The Boys break into a psychiatric hospital, they discover trapped Compound V patients and learn that Vought is trying to stabilize the drug in adults. When it's found out that Annie leaked information about Compound V, Hughie attempts a rescue mission that ends up with Maeve saving Annie. This information leads Congresswoman Victoria Neuman to schedule a hearing against Vought. By the end of the season, Hughie ends up working for Neuman, thinking she's a good guy. It turns out, though, that she's been a secret assassin -- with the ability to make people's heads explode -- all along.\n\nMaeve is in full \"bring down Homelander\" mode after the plane crash, warning her ex-girlfriend about him and plots a way to bring him down. She's not the only one trying to bring Homelander down -- Butcher is trying to find Becca and her son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) and is ready to do anything to find their whereabouts. When he does, Becca refuses to leave with him because he won't accept Ryan as her son. Homelander, on the other hand, has been aggressively trying to become a father to Ryan, forcing himself into their lives and pushing Ryan to use his powers.\n\nWhile he's trying to \"parent\" Ryan, Homelander is also desperately trying to keep his standing in The Seven, due to Stormfront's newfound popularity. While both Maeve and Butcher are trying to bring him down, a video surfaces of Homelander killing two civilians which Stormfront helps him deal with and the two embark on a relationship. The Boys discover that Stormfront has a Nazi past and was involved in a racially-charged murder. She also tells Homelander she's the first successful Compound V subject, and the widow of Vought's founder. The pair together get Ryan to leave his mother, and Butcher attempts to save Becca and Ryan from Stormfront. Ryan, when Stormfront attacks his mother, cripples her with his powers, but accidentally kills Becca in the process. Maeve uses the plane footage to blackmail Homelander into letting them go.\n\nAs for the rest of The Seven, The Deep joins a church to regain favor that quickly becomes a cult situation (one that recruits people using Fresca of all things) where he's drugged and ends up in an arranged marriage. After all of that, he's still not reinstated into The Seven. A-Train has awakened from his coma, and is taken out of the group by Homelander. He ends up joining the Deep for a minute at the church, but quickly questions their intentions. Unlike The Deep, he ends up back in The Seven.\n\nTaking place a year after the events of Season 2, The Boys are working for Victoria Neuman's Bureau of Superhero Affairs, which aims to capture problematic Supes. In order to polish the tarnished reputation of The Seven, Annie is now co-captain along with Homelander. Maeve is also working alongside Butcher to aid in taking Homelander down for good, telling him to investigate Soldier Boy (Jensen Ackles), a Captain America-esque superhero who mysteriously died, in order to find someone who could destroy him. She also gives him V24, a Compound V variant that allows the user to have temporary superpowers.\n\nV24 is a big part of Season 3. Both Butcher and Hughie begin taking it, being able to protect themselves in ways they previously couldn't. Annie finds out that 3-5 doses of V24 can potentially kill users and tells Butcher who abandons Hughie (saving him from terminally dosing on the drug) rather than tell him directly. At the end of the season, it's revealed that the V24 has left Butcher terminally ill.\n\nSpeaking of superpowers, Hughie finds out that his boss, Neuman, isn't who she says she is: she's actually a Supe. He investigates her further, finding out that Vought's CEO Stan Edgar (Giancarlo Esposito) is actually her adoptive father. She later goes against him, leading to him being pushed out from Vought, leaving Homelander alone at the top of the company. After getting Compound V from Homelander, she injects her daughter with it. At the end of the season, Neuman is declared to be Robert Singer's running mate in the presidential election after Homelander has The Deep kill the politician who was previously on the ticket.\n\nThe hunt for Soldier Boy takes our guys to Russia and to Herogasm, an annual \"supe orgy,\" which has some of the weirdest stuff you'll see on television. They find Soldier Boy's widow and old friends to find out information about him -- learning he died in Nicaragua on a C.I.A. mission. Mother's Milk rejoins the group because Soldier Boy killed his family, so everyone has a reason to find the guy. They find Soldier Boy, still alive, in a Russian laboratory. He frequently releases energy bursts that cause explosions around him, inadvertently harming Kimiko and causing her to seemingly lose her powers. However, he goes on a spree finding his former teammates with Butcher and Hughie in exchange to kill Homelander. While his attempts to kill Homelander don't end up working out, it is revealed that he's Homelander's father. He's later taken into government custody after they leave with The Boys, Annie, and Maeve to kill Homelander. Homelander is with Ryan during this and when he tries to protect him, Soldier Boy attacks Ryan, causing everyone else to attack Soldier Boy. Maeve takes one for the team, keeping Soldier Boy away from the others. This in turn causes her to lose her powers, but she can finally live a non-Supe life in private with her girlfriend.\n\nUpon learning that Soldier Boy is his father, Homelander, in true Homelander fashion, goes nuts. He kills Noir (Nathan Mitchell) because he never told him who his father is, even though we learn about Noir's own past trauma with Soldier Boy. Earlier in the season, Homelander is already on the edge -- claiming his greatness at Vought, even though executives aren't quite convinced. He pressures Starlight to pretend they are in a relationship. A-Train informs Homelander of Starlight's planned coup, and threatens Hughie if she doesn't comply. Annie, finally sick of Vought, livestreams leaving The Seven and condemns them. Homelander confronts her, but Annie records him confessing to his crimes and posts it online. After he escapes with Ryan at the Soldier Boy confrontation, he ends up at a Neuman rally, killing a Starlight supporter for hitting Ryan with a thrown soda bottle.\n\nAs for everyone else, Kimiko and Frenchie continue their will-they-won't they and both grapple with their pasts (and Kimiko eventually gets her powers back). A-Train tries to rebrand himself -- including a cringy energy drink commercial that brilliantly satirizes an infamous Pepsi ad -- and goes back and forth on whether or not he'll side with Homelander or Starlight. He ends up with the Supe Blue Hawk, asking him to make a public apology for his racist behavior. It ends up in a fight with A-Train's brother becoming paralyzed (and A-Train kills Blue Hawk as revenge during Herogasm).\n\nAfter suffering another heart attack, A-Train ends up with a heart transplant -- Blue Hawk's. And the Deep finally gets his wish, landing a spot back in The Seven because of his comeback which includes a book about escaping the Fresca cult, and a new wife. However during Herogasm, he meets an octopus and after they have consensual sex, he tries to get his wife to open up their relationship, which she declines (and later writes her own tell-all book). And he continues to remain faithful to Homelander.\n\nIf you haven't watched Gen V yet, you don't need to for Season 4 of The Boys. But if you get the chance, you should. The drama set at a superhero college is a fantastic world building of The Boys universe and features a fun story and incredible performances that feel like a cross between The Boys that we already love and a kind of X-Men vibe. However, the one thing to know about Gen V is that Godolkin University, where they go to school, has been testing (illegally, of course) a Supe-specific virus that can only kill them. You won't be surprised to learn that Vought, and some of our favorite Vought executives (Ashley!) are involved.", "source": {"uri": "menshealth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stormfront (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_Boy_(The_Shirelles_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soldier Boy (The Shirelles song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

But this episode is easily my favorite in this first batch of three; it strikes a really good balance between plot and small-scale character drama, both exciting and emotional.\n\nLet's start big picture this time. Dakota Bob is full steam ahead with the planned Superhero Management Act, now with an amendment immediately banning supes from military, private policing, and government positions. It'll be a tough one to get through Congress; hundreds of representatives and senators are still in Vought's pocket, and Victoria Neuman knows that the bill could doom her own career. That's not to mention the growing polarization between the Starlighters and Hometeamers, which Sister Sage hopes to deliberately exacerbate by picking Firecracker for the Seven. (I guess the fuck-up last episode didn't matter, or Sage never found out.) Firecracker's incendiary language will make both sides louder and louder, eventually setting the stage for a coup. That's the villains' end goal for this season, and it's clarifying to have the stakes spelled out in such explicit terms.\n\nSome of this, admittedly, feels a little reminiscent of Stormfront's arc in season two: Sage is the new partner at Homelander's side, and the attempted attack by a radicalized Firecracker fan at Starlight House reminds me of the Stormchaser who once killed an innocent grocery store employee he suspected of being a supe terrorist. But things at Vought Tower feel different enough these days that I'm willing to overlook some of the repetitive satirical content.\n\nPart of that different feeling comes from Sage quickly usurping Ashley as CEO, though she'll stay on as a figurehead and errand girl. If this were a normal job, that would be a blessing in disguise, freeing Ashley up to build her career somewhere else. But seeing the speed with which Homelander zaps a hole in one traitorous employee's head scares her into staying. Maybe she'd be safer somewhere else, but with the amount of corruption and grotesquerie she has witnessed at Vought, Homelander probably wouldn't let her leave anyway.\n\nWe also learn a key bit of Firecracker's backstory that adds a personal element to her war with Starlight: She used to run into Annie a lot back in their pageant days, when the toxic influence of Annie's mother made her a bully. At one pageant, when Firecracker (\"Sparkler\" at the time) was 13 years old, she and Annie made it to the finals, and Annie made a tossed-off comment to the other girls about how Firecracker could only make it to the finals by having an \"ass-fuck gang-bang\" with the judges. That remark mutated into a rumor damaging enough to force Firecracker out of the circuit.\n\nIt might be ridiculous for Firecracker to assume that Annie is the same \"conniving little mean-girl bitch\" as when she was a teenager, but it's an interesting change of pace to see Annie in the bully role, and to see her apologizing to arguably one of the evilest people in America. I'm intrigued by the idea of Firecracker working to unearth this darker, crueler side of America's sweetheart. It feels possible that there's something real in Firecracker's generally unfair characterization of her.\n\nThere's also really solid progress on the A-Train front, with the Boys' newest informant directly involving himself in a plot to surveil a meeting between Homelander and Neuman during a Vought on Ice rehearsal at VoughtCoin Arena. Mother's Milk points out that he could blackmail A-Train if he wanted to, continuing this show's endless exchange of threats. But I like that his goal isn't to force A-Train to help them; it's to appeal to the man during a crisis of conscience and make him want to help the Boys.\n\nHughie wriggles through the vents to plant a bug when the meeting gets moved up, but there's not enough time to escape without making a sound, so he sits there and waits, listening to the conversation. Sage suggests an arrangement: She and Homelander will kill Dakota Bob themselves after certification, protecting Neuman from suspicion, and in return, Neuman will disband the Bureau of Superhuman Affairs, condemn the \"defund the supes\" movement, remove \"critical supe theory\" (really?) from schools, put heroes in charge of police departments all over the country, and, most difficult of all, come out publicly as a supe herself. Before they can set anything in stone, though, Hughie inevitably drips sweat down onto Homelander, exposing his presence and almost getting himself fried to a crisp.\n\nThis whole Vought on Ice set piece might not be as flashy and drawn-out as the fight with Splinter last episode, but I think it's my favorite action climax of the season so far. Part of that is the Vought on Ice stuff itself: the \"Put the 'Christ' Back in Christmas\" song is perfect, and the deaths of a few ice skaters are amusingly gnarly, from Homelander's off-balance laser blast to the violent rush across the ice to flee. (Of course a bunch of ice skaters would end up dead by the end of the episode.) But I also just always enjoy The Boys in espionage thriller mode, and the whole sequence of Homelander chasing Hughie (and knowing exactly who he's chasing) is great fun. Realistically, Hughie doesn't stand the slightest chance against Homelander, so I appreciate how it ends, with A-Train silently saving his ass.\n\nIt makes for a pretty shitty day for Homelander, who has another conversation with the more confident, cold-blooded version of himself he sees in the mirror. Still smarting from jealousy after hearing that Ryan spent the day with Butcher, he wants to \"transcend his humanity\" and get over his undignified emotions to become the superior version of himself. Apparently, his way of doing that will be to confront his past -- like Hughie, Annie, Frenchie, and Kimiko have already been doing this season.\n\nFrenchie and Kimiko's side quest in this episode accomplishes that same goal, with Kimiko encountering a scarred young woman she remembers from her Shining Light days. The objective here is to completely wipe out everyone involved in this operation, but Kimiko (somewhat annoyingly) lets the scarred woman go, neglecting to explain her significance to Frenchie. Frenchie also continually refuses to tell Kimiko why he's so resistant to Colin, preferring to just take hallucinogens and stop thinking about it. He doesn't participate in the bloodshed at all this time; instead, he watches Kimiko's kills in a daze, visualizing blood and guts as bubbles and rubber ducks.\n\nIf we weren't clear already on what's bugging Frenchie, a slightly unnecessary hallucination reminds us. An imaginary Colin calls him out for all the other people he murdered on Little Nina's orders, suddenly crowding the room around him. Nina herself appears, too, calling him a failure for \"fucking the boy he orphaned\" and remaining trapped in this cycle of self-flagellation despite Nina herself being gone. In a nice post-mission venting session at home base later, he bonds with Annie over that constant temptation to abdicate responsibility, to hold anyone other than yourself at fault for your own mistakes.\n\nAt least Butcher is sticking with doing things \"the right way\" for a while; we've seen him resort to his usual brutal tactics on missions this season, but he always pulls back before doing something really awful. In \"We'll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here,\" we see him contemplate drugging Ryan with an extremely potent opioid so that he and his scary CIA buddy can squirrel him away to a safe house and \"deprogram\" him. But after a genuine heart-to-heart with the kid, he decides against it, dumping the spiked cookies in the trash.\n\nThat heart-to-heart might be the emotional peak of the season for me so far, maybe because we've been following this dynamic for a while now, especially with the promise that Butcher made to Becca back in the season-two finale. Butcher and Ryan's foosball game offers a perfect segue to discuss Ryan's frustration with everyone at Vought Tower letting him win all the time (a parallel irritation to his biological father's). And I especially felt for the kid when he opened up about accidentally killing someone, especially with that really vulnerable comment: \"I get why you don't want me. I wouldn't want me, neither.\"\n\nHow gratifying to close the loop on Butcher's painful rejection of Ryan last season, with Butcher finally offering some important context and a confession: He intentionally pushed Ryan away because he has no business being a father, but now he's terrified he'll die before he gets the chance to make things right with Ryan. Seeing the two of them lower their defenses and just spend some time connecting feels really refreshing -- and it makes Kessler's final warning all the more grim. Soon, the CIA may need to either train Ryan or kill him. The country itself might be at stake, but the characters and relationships are what I'm most scared for right now.\n\n* Hughie learns that there's nothing he can do legally about power of attorney, but he and his mom have a productive heart-to-heart where she tells him about the severe depression she experienced in the years after his birth. Her choice to abandon the family was \"life or death,\" and Hughie's dad didn't want her to confuse him by continuing to call after she left. Seems like she and her son are already really starting to heal, so I'm curious where this story goes from here.\n\n* Sage knows that someone stole the surveillance footage of the accused Starlighters, and I don't anticipate her letting that slide.\n\n* The Deep and Sage unexpectedly hook up near the end of the episode after sharing a Bloomin' Onion from Outback Steakhouse, so that's fun. Sage also seems stoned throughout the scene, probably related to the bloody tool we see lying nearby. I do love the idea that the smartest person in the world wants to watch Say Yes to the Dress and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.\n\n* \"These 'vaccines' that they're giving out at the Starlight House actually cause autism, and not that cool Rain Man autism that makes you good at counting cards and shit.\"\n\n* \"Enough yeast infections to open a Panera\" is quite vivid.\n\n* I know Vought controls a lot of the news, but it strikes me as odd that Butcher would see Ryan's televised save without also seeing the splattered body he left behind. Isn't there plenty of footage from live-streaming bystanders? Isn't Ryan legally in the clear anyway, since he was \"protecting\" a little girl?", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_rosenstock@vulture.com", "name": "Ben Rosenstock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormfront_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormfront (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figurehead", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Figurehead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_listening_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covert listening device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice skating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendiary_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incendiary device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queen Victoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback_Steakhouse", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outback Steakhouse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/124/d40/0d5d156bc60dd0aabf03174a3cdacf7945-THBY-S4-FG-403-00315415-Still442-3000.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

But before you watch The Boys season 4, check out the list of characters whose deaths occur between seasons 1 and 3.\n\nHere are the important characters who have met their ends in the previous three seasons.\n\nWho has died in The Boys so far?\n\nDeveloped from the namesake comic book series by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, The Boys takes place in a world where superheroes are often megalomaniacs, killers, and products of corporate marketing. Driven by personal tragedies, the eponymous team of vigilantes is locked in a bitter struggle with these superheroes. No one is safe in The Boys Universe, no matter their importance in the overall narrative.\n\nRobin Ward\n\nRobin (Jess Salgueiro) was Hughie Campbell's (Jack Quaid) girlfriend at the start of the series. A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) accidentally kills her after running through her while being high on Compound V. Her death sets off the chain of events that leads to Hughie joining The Boys.\n\nTranslucent\n\nTranslucent or Schecht (Alex Hassell) was a member of the superhero group The Seven. He had the power of invisibility. Hughie kills him by detonating the C4 that Frenchie (Tomer Capone) planted in the man's colon.\n\nPopclaw\n\nPopclaw or Charlotte (Brittany Allen) was A-Train's girlfriend. After she tells The Boys about Compound V, A-Train kills her by making her overdose on the substance.\n\nMadelyn Stillwell\n\nMadelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) was a high-ranking executive of Vought International in season 1. Homelander (Antony Starr) kills her with his heat vision.\n\nSusan Raynor\n\nSusan Raynor (Jennifer Esposito) was a deputy director of the CIA and had a complicated relationship with Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). During a meeting with some members of the Boys, Raynor's head explodes. It is later revealed that Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) was responsible for her death.\n\nLamplighter\n\nLamplighter (Shawn Ashmore) was a former member of The Seven but was demoted before the start of the series. He died by suicide in Vought Tower.\n\nBecca Butcher\n\nBecca Butcher (Shantel VanSanten) was Butcher's wife and a former Vought International employee. Homelander sexually assaulted her, after which she became pregnant with his child. Eventually, her son with Homelander, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti), accidentally killed her with his heat vision while trying to protect her from Stormfront (Aya Cash).\n\nAlastair Adana\n\nThe chairman of the Church of the Collective, Alastair Adana was killed by Victoria Neuman.\n\nStormfront\n\nStormfront or Klara Risinger was once the wife of Frederick Vought, the man who invented Compound V and established what is now Vought International. She was the first successful recipient of Compound V, which effectively made her the first Supe to ever exist. In season 3, Stormfront died by suicide.\n\nSupersonic\n\nSupersonic or Alex (Miles Gaston Villanueva) was a member of The Seven for a short period until Homelander killed him for working against him.\n\nBlue Hawk\n\nBlue Hawk (Nick Wechsler) was a bigoted superhero whose costume was inspired by law enforcement gear.

Viewers are likely wondering why he does this as he seemed enthused about the buffet just a few moments earlier. We'll examine why The Deep wouldn't want to be seen eating in front of Homelander below.\n\nWhy does The Deep spit the food out when he sees Homelander in The Boys S04E01?\n\nOne of the more confusing scenes in The Boys Season 4 so far is when The Deep spits out his food when Homelander enters the buffet in Episode 1. Just moments before, he was commenting on how good the food was to A-Train, so what gives?\n\nWhile we don't get an overt explanation of The Deep's behavior, he likely spits the food out for one of two reasons:\n\nThe Deep is a pathetic, spineless suck-up, and that's what's kept him alive when so many other members of the Seven have died. As we see earlier in the episode, when Homelander tells The Deep to perform fellatio on A-Train, he puts up little protest despite his obvious discomfort with the scenario. The Deep will defer to Homelander in any situation, and because of that, he's rarely at risk of Homelander's ire. Homelander might bully The Deep, but he manages to fly under the radar most of the time. He might instinctively spit out the food, so there's no chance Homelander might think The Deep isn't entirely focused on whatever he has to say.\n\nAlternatively, Homelander has bullied other supes about their eating habits in the past. In particular, when A-Train was sidelined after breaking his leg, Homelander called him fat on more than one occasion. We've seen The Deep eating junk food multiple times throughout the series, and he might comfort eat. As such, he's probably on guard against possible criticism from Homelander, which would cause him to immediately spit out his food when he entered the room.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_faulkner@comingsoon.net", "name": "Jason Faulkner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deep_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Deep (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_(landform)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spit (landform)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buffet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bloom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Bloom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fellatio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Junk food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Dried_and_Emergency_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Dried and Emergency Supplies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/The-Boys-Season-4-Episode-1-Why-Does-the-Deep-Spit-Out-Food.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Last season ended with faux-progressive, head-popping supe Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) being chosen as the Democratic vice presidential nominee.\n\n\"The Boys\" season 4, episode 1, \"Department of Dirty Tricks,\" opens with the election being called for Neuman and her running mate, Bob Singer (Jim Beaver). In a mild surprise, Singer is working with the Boys and their CIA handler Grace Mallory (Laila Robins). He now knows Neuman is a supe and that once he's sworn in, his head will only stay on his shoulders for so long.\n\nThough he's not on the ticket, Homelander's (Antony Starr) presence is felt in Neuman's storyline. He's at the victory party and intends future-President Neuman to be his patsy in seizing control of America. This season reveals that while he's invulnerable to violence, Homelander ages like a human. (Starr is currently 48 years old in real life). His mid-life crisis is driving him to finally create the supe-dominated world he's always wanted so that he can leave it to his son, Ryan (Cameron Crovetti).\n\nDuring season 3 of \"The Boys,\" I wrote about how fans really shouldn't have been surprised by Homelander being so evil. The show wears its anti-capitalist, pro-social justice politics on its sleeve.

If there is anyone out there who would absolutely love to see Homelander taken down to some degree, it is her. She's been forced to deal with so much because of him, and she never got a real chance to show her true self when she was with Vought.\n\nOf course, the superhero company a.k.a. evil empire has already figured out replacements for both Maeve and Starlight (who departed the Seven), as you see both Firecracker and Sage within the premiere. Both of them seem to be fully in line with what Homelander wanted in the premiere, at least to some extent. It does appear as though Sage may have some sort of hidden agenda that she is trying to achieve, but what will she be willing to do in order to achieve that? For now, let's just say that this remains a mystery.\n\nRelated - Be sure to get some more discussions on The Boys season 5, otherwise known as the final season\n\nBe sure to share right now!

His ass hurts. During a trip to Mexico last week, Antony Starr, the New Zealand-born actor who plays Homelander on Prime's The Boys, sat on a box that turned out to be a thin piece of cardboard covering a portable generator. \"The handle went flush up my backside onto my tailbone,\" he says, adjusting his position again. \"So I'm doing a lot of angled cheek sitting.\" He laughs. \"Way more than you needed to know.\"\n\nStarr tends to get at least mildly offended when people assume he's anything like his evil-Superman character, a smiling, volatile sadist with unlimited power, profound emotional damage, and a freaky breast-milk fetish, all draped in an American-flag cape. On set, day players and new crew members treat him like he's really Homelander, scurrying out of his way in fear as he walks by in costume. Off-duty, he tries to create as much physical distance from the character as possible, even to the point of shaving his head at season's end. At the moment, he's grown a stubbly beard, with his hair back to its natural brown instead of the character's Aryan blond; his tinted glasses blunt the impact of the ice-blue eyes they share. \"People are surprised, like, 'Oh, my God, you're actually not like him,'' says Starr, a 48-year-old dad and hardcore Queens of the Stone Age fan. \"And I'm like, 'Yeah, he's a psychopathic narcissist. So yeah, thanks. Thank you for that.'\u2009\" He smiles at the idea that the tailbone incident offers objective proof of that reality. \"I actually don't have superpowers,\" he says. \"I have a very sensitive rump.\"\n\nIn the world of The Boys, based on the gleefully scabrous 2000s indie comic-book series of the same name by writer Garth Ennis and artist Darick Robertson, superheroes are real, pop-culture-dominating, and with rare exceptions, entirely unheroic. They're all the creation of Vought International, a many-tentacled corporation that probably offers free two-day shipping when it's not deluding the public into worshiping the \"supes\" as celebrities, and, increasingly, culture-war political figures. In the show's fourth season, (which kicks off today), Homelander, an ever-more obvious Trump analogue, begins to plot outright fascist rule of the United States, with the assistance of a Bible-thumping, conspiracy-mongering new character, Firecracker (Valorie Curry), explicitly modeled on the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nWith its bald political analogies, not to mention an adolescent preoccupation with splattery eviscerations and novel sexual grotesqueries -- extending, in Season Four, to a glimpse of a self-replicating supe engaging in a one-man human-chain orgy -- The Boys could never be accused of subtlety. But somehow, the show's depiction of post-MAGA America as a tragicomic, blood-soaked carnival of lies comes off as more true-to-life than any other. When its provocations hit just right, it can feel like it's secretly the very best show on television, and without a doubt, the most entertaining. Just ask Barack Obama, who astonished the show's creators when he touted it on one of his year-end lists, which then led them to wonder what he made of the episode with a giant exploding penis prop.\n\n\"Homelander isn't scary because he's powerful. He's scary because he's weak.\"\n\n\"I had no idea it was based off a comic book when I first read the script,\" says one of the show's leads, Jack Quaid, who plays Hughie Campbell, a gentle-hearted Billy Joel fan who's the most unlikely recruit to the titular Boys, a law-flouting crew of anti-supe insurgents led by the amoral, Homelander-hunting Billy Butcher (Karl Urban). From some angles, Jack looks a lot like his dad, Dennis Quaid, but his vibe is pure young Tom Hanks. \"I thought someone just made a show about America. And put superheroes into it.\"\n\nThat's pretty much how the show's creator sees it. \"The superhero trappings are literally just the suit it wears,\" says showrunner Eric Kripke, previously best known for the long-running, much-loved CW show Supernatural. \"It's about politics and authoritarianism and media, and an almost Simpsons- or South Park-like desire to parody things of the moment. And Sam Raimi ultraviolence. The reason I'm in genre, period, is because with monsters or demons or superheroes, you're able to say subversive shit that all the people writing the classy-ass prestige shit can never get away with saying. And that, to me, is the fun of it.\"\n\n\"It's power, grief, hope, and betrayal in a show about exploding dicks.\"\n\nThe skull-eyed cynicism of its behind-the-curtains gaze at societal power ends up making The Boys oddly reminiscent of one of the best \"classy-ass prestige\" productions of the era. \"It really delves into the dynamics of power and grief and hope and betrayal, wrapped up in a show that's also about exploding dicks,\" says Claudia Doumit, who plays Victoria Neuman, a charismatic, vaguely AOC-like politician who secretly can make people's heads explode with her mind. \"It's Succession -- with exploding penises.\"\n\nTHE BOYS' NARRATIVE MOMENTUM is ruthless. In last season's cliffhanger ending, Homelander commits a laser-eyes murder in broad daylight, but he's acquitted so rapidly at the start of Season Four that we don't see a second of the actual trial. \"There was only one way that trial could end,\" says Kripke, sitting in his West L.A. production office. Nearby is a writers room I'm barred from entering because there are already ideas for Season Five on the whiteboards, even though the show is still a week away from being officially renewed. \"If he was guilty and he went to jail -- one, he wouldn't stay, and two, he'd be a criminal and on the run, and that's just not the show we want to make. So he can only be innocent. And when there's an ending that is a fait accompli, I immediately say to the room, let's get through it as fast as possible.\" The murder was, of course, a nod to Trump's comment about how he could shoot someone \"in the middle of Fifth Avenue\" without losing support, and, indeed, we see Homelander's fans cheering for the bloodshed. In the new season, when chaos breaks out after the verdict, Homelander tells the crowd, \"You're all very special people,\" a nod to Trump on Jan. 6.\n\nWhen Kripke started developing the TV version of The Boys in 2015, four years before its debut, he thought he was working on a parody of celebrity culture and superheroes themselves. \"It wasn't until I started to get more and more in Homelander's head that we said, 'Wait, they're using their celebrity for authoritarian ends,'\u2009\" he says. \"Which is a phenomenon that bubbles up now and again in history but, when we started this thing, was not in the front of everyone's minds. And then suddenly it was. And we're looking at each other like, 'Did we stumble into the metaphor that best describes the moment we're actually living in?' Then it just got really exciting.\"\n\nIncreasingly, Kripke began seeing Homelander as Donald Trump. \"He's not scary because he's powerful,\" he says. \"He's scary because he's weak. Our interpretation was, if you have that much power, you would feel inevitably disconnected and superior to humanity. But the more you become dis\u00adconnected from humanity, the more you hate the parts of yourself that are human. If you combine all that, you'll come up with malignant narcissism.\"\n\nSome right-wing fans of The Boys were vocally unhappy online when Kripke made the already-obvious-to-most Trump connection explicit in a 2022 interview with this publication. As it turns out, Starr himself isn't always thrilled with it either. \"For me, it's a bit of a red herring,\" he says, \"because if we strictly stayed in that lane, the character would be one- or two-dimensional, and we wanted to create something more layered. Whatever parallels there are to the real world, it has to be driven by our characters.\"\n\nStarr's reminders along those lines have helped push the show to stay focused on Homelander's decidedly non-Trumpian characteristics, like the fact that he was raised, entirely unloved and parentless, in a laboratory -- which we learn more about in a gruesome, revenge-laden return to that setting in Season Four. \"I'll give Ant credit,\" says Kripke. \"He'll speak up, and he'll say, 'Eric, they are different people.' It's easy to fall into a Saturday Night Live trap of being a parody, but I actually owe the psychological truth of the character first and foremost.\"\n\nMuch of Starr's ever-wounded, ever-deadly performance was present from his self-taped initial audition for the part. \"He rang so true of that American patriotism and optimism meets American Psycho,\" says Kripke. \"Because he was charming, but then his smile would just get a little too big. Or there was nothing behind his eyes.\" But it wasn't until a scene in the show's second episode where Homelander is accurately accused of downing a plane that Kripke really saw how far Starr could take it. \"He has this take where it's 20 seconds of just eight different expressions on his face -- 'I'm sorry, Mommy' and also 'Yes, I totally did it,'\u2009\" he says. \"I was like, 'Oh, my God, this guy is so capturing the snake's nest of insecurity and victimization and power that is Homelander.\"\n\nFor Starr, what makes Homelander terrifying is his unpredictability, the looming sense that he might suddenly murder anyone in his vicinity. He works to inhabit the character so fully that he's never quite sure himself how he'll approach any given moment on set. \"We try and set it up so that in the scenes, like, I don't know what's gonna happen,\" Starr says. \"Like, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.\"\n\nOf course, all that actorly effort has to be paired with frequently pretending that you're shooting deadly lasers out of your eyeballs -- \"literally standing there doing this little head move and looking very serious,\" Starr says. When Karl Urban's Butcher got superpowers last season, he told Starr, \"Fuck, I had no idea how stupid I was going to feel doing laser eyes.\" \"I'm like, 'Welcome to my world, my brother,'\u2009\" recalls Starr.\n\nStarr is slippery on the subject of how much Homelander might reflect any dark side of his own, but suggests it's overly facile to find any evidence in his widely reported 2022 bar fight in Spain, in which he punched a 21-year-old man twice and hit him with a glass, resulting in assault charges and a suspended sentence. \"We live in a soundbite age,\" he says, elliptically, \"where people read a headline and then they make a decision, and the decision is concrete and that's who someone is. I would rather shut up than speak out of turn about something that's super complicated.\"\n\nIf he shares anything with Homelander, it's \"vulnerability,\" says Starr, who can't help seeing the character as a victim, a \"poor little kid that was damaged so badly and just used for his entire life. He's mentally ill. He's been through a hell of a lot. It all ties back to something I actually do personally care about and wanted to try and honor as much as possible -- the damage and mental-health issues that come up from the kind of treatment that he's had. And we all struggle. We all struggle. I think that's probably why people strangely empathize with the character. Some people got it completely wrong at one point and were championing him like he was the hero, and that was a bad thing! That was wrong. But I do get a lot of people saying they have very conflicted feelings about him.\"\n\nTHE BOYS COMIC-BOOK SERIES was very much a product of peak George W. Bush-era culture. It began in August 2006, after voters declined to vote for change, with the Iraq War raging and Hurricane Katrina fresh on the minds of its creators. The ruling class was indifferent, if not actively malevolent -- why would superheroes be any different? Darick Robertson, the series' artist and co-creator, finds it depressing how well the TV series came to fit a new era. \"It just feels like we're in this doom loop as a culture,\" he says, \"because all the stuff that happened during the Bush years laid the ground for what's happening in the Trump years.\"\n\nThe earliest idea for The Boys from Garth Ennis, a boundary-pushing Irish writer, was bold but wildly unworkable, Robertson recalls: He imagined the Boys as a team of anti-superhero investigators in the actual DC Comics universe, where the stories would imply, without ever stating outright, that characters like Superman and Batman were secretly evil and perverse. Robertson says he suggested they instead create analogues of DC Comics characters, with Super\u00adman becoming Homelander, Aquaman becoming the amphibious character the Deep, and so on. Homelander was originally Liberator, and his costume had \"very obvious nationalistic, Nazi-referencing symbolism,\" says Robertson. \"As he evolved, I put him in the American cape, because I love that line about how the last refuge of a scoundrel is patriotism.\"\n\nSeth Rogen and his producing partner, Evan Goldberg, were already fans of Ennis, and bought the first issue at Golden Apple, a comic-book store on Melrose Avenue in L.A., the day it came out. \"We were like, 'Holy shit, this is fucking crazy,'\u2009\" says Rogen. \"And that week we went to Sony and we're like, 'You guys should make this.'\u2009\"\n\n\"And they were like, 'We should ... with someone else,'\u2009\" recalls Goldberg.\n\nSony did buy the rights to the property, which went through a series of incarnations over a decade before ending up back in the hands of Rogen, Goldberg, and Kripke. For a while, director Adam McKay was trying to turn The Boys into a trilogy of movies -- the first one went as far as a finished screenplay and even demo animatics of scenes -- but he wasn't able to get it greenlighted in a pre-MCU Hollywood. \"I wouldn't change how it worked out,\" says Robertson, \"because the show is amazing. But he was doing really cool stuff. It just came down to it being 2008, not 2018. I just don't think they were ready for it yet.\"\n\nFOR THE SHOW'S CAST, The Boys offers a chance at both meaty character work and certain unique indignities. In Episode One, in the inciting incident of the entire story, the show's Flash-style character, A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), accidentally runs at super-speed straight through a civilian's body, with predictably horrific consequences. The civilian in question happens to be Hughie Campbell's girlfriend, and he's holding hands with her at the moment of collision. \"They loaded up those huge, like, cylinder air cannons full of blood and guts and stuff,\" says Usher. \"And they're like, 'When you run by, we're going to shoot Jack in the face with this.' It was that moment, me and Jack sitting on set, 12 hours covered in blood, when we were like, 'Whoa, this is different.'\u2009\"\n\nUsher's character has spent the show hurtling toward either damnation or redemption for his many sins. At the beginning, he modeled A-Train's indifference toward humanity on young professional athletes. \"In the NBA, they show the players walking through the tunnel leading up to the game,\" he says, \"and it's like they don't even see people. They're just above the world. That's kind of what I think A-Train is like.\" Fans of the show are constantly challenging Usher to race, and he always demurs. \"I hate running,\" he says. \"I'm only fast on TV. I don't even run on the treadmill. Like, I would do anything but run for cardio.\"\n\nThere is no character more absurd on The Boys, or possibly on any show ever, than its Aquaman analogue, the Deep. He's (hilariously) played by Chace Crawford, formerly of Gossip Girl, who instantly recognized the character's pretty-boy, none-too-bright brand of ultratoxic masculinity in part from his old teen-star milieu. \"You do get put in a bit of a box, in the eyes of people in the industry,\" Crawford says. \"It was very meta for me, within this show, to kind of make fun of that type of person.\"\n\nIn the series' first episode, the Deep coerces one of the show's few morally upright characters, Starlight (Erin Moriarty), into a sex act, casting-couch style. As Starlight reckons with the trauma he inflicted, the Deep spirals through an endless series of well-\u00addeserved humiliations, including a scene where he's caught in graphic sexual congress with an octopus. \"I was, like, in denial about it,\" says Crawford. \"It got 24 hours out, and I kind of almost had a panic attack. I called Kripke and I was like, 'What are the angles gonna be? How naked do I have to be?'\u2009\" The show employs an intimacy coordinator -- \"but not with the octopus,\" Crawford says.\n\nFor Moriarty, playing Starlight -- arguably the only real superhero on the show -- is a deep commitment. \"I'm experiencing something with this character that I haven't before, which is that I'm very protective of her,\" says Moriarty. \"I know this is a young woman who is going through things other young women have gone through. So I feel like it's my job to do it justice as best that I can. The second I don't grasp the emotional stakes in a scene that entails a horrific, traumatizing situation, I don't feel like I've done my job.\"\n\nFacing 16-hour days with sometimes emotionally brutal material, particularly in the new season, Moriarty is willing to go to extreme lengths to make it work. \"I ended up buying smelling salts off of Amazon,\" she says, \"because I was listening to this podcast where these guys were talking about how it makes them feel like the Hulk. And I had to feel like the Hulk in certain moments of the upcoming season.\" She laughs. \"I would smell the smelling salts and be like 'Aaaah,' and go do the scene. I definitely killed brain cells. I'm a nut job when it comes to prep.\"\n\nOne constant since the first season is the romance between Starlight and Hughie, which manages to provide some rare moments of sweetness amidst the show's madness. The stars say that part isn't hard. \"I think a lot of people look at us and they think, like, 'Are they dating?'\" says Moriarty. \"Because the chemistry is so on point. But it's because he's one of my best friends, and I love him so much, and I would do anything for him. He's like the brother I never had.\"\n\n\"I agree with that,\" says Quaid (who's actually dating another actress on the show, Claudia Doumit), \"but I sometimes don't say that when I'm being interviewed because I'm like, 'It's weird though, because we kiss on camera a lot.'\" The pair does their best to keep the Hughie-Starlight relationship from feeling saccharine. \"We really wanted to make sure that they don't feel cutesy or too wholesome,\" Quaid adds. \"They do need to be the good people, but they can't be the good and boring people. I like every time we give them a little bit of an edge, a little bit of a spice. This season definitely has that.\"\n\nMoriarty manages to radiate Christopher Reeve-worthy levels of sheer goodness as Starlight, but she's grateful that the character is far from perfect. \"The fact that she can be so unambiguously good and make mistakes, that has been healing for me to play,\" says Moriarty, who's not alone in finding her role therapeutic. Karen Fukuhara, who plays the mute, super-strong, formerly feral Kimiko, finds a welcome catharsis in her character's gore-splattered murder sprees. \"Maybe it comes from being a woman, and maybe it comes from being Japanese, but a lot of times we have to filter our emotions,\" Fukuhara says. \"And Kimiko has none of that. She hasn't really grown up within the patriarchy or, truly, any kind of social construct. And therefore she has no filter. And I admire that about her. She is constantly fighting for her life, and sometimes it requires a little bit of rage to spill out. And, in her case, to take off some heads.\"\n\nNo one on The Boys is Method, not even Starr, for all his intensity. And by all accounts, the cast gets along unusually well. \"There's always someone who's a dick,\" says Starr, pausing before he cracks up the room with his punchline: \"In this case, at least it's me.\"\n\n\"Our show is punk rock. We deserve extra scorn if we sell out.\"\n\n\"I WORRY A LOT,\" says Kripke, \"about becoming the thing that we're satirizing. Like, daily, I worry about it.\" He's sitting in The Boys' production office, a glass-lined suite in a West L.A. office building, not far from the famously absurd grocery store Erewhon. At 50, he still carries himself more like a journeyman TV writer than the mini mogul he's become, in a loose gray T-shirt, jeans, and New Balances. On the shelves in his office are Stephen King and James Ellroy novels (the latter was a major influence on Ellis for The Boys), a full collection of The Boys comic-book series, various awards, and a replica Han Solo blaster -- Kripke is a lifelong Star Wars fan and fully intends to do something in that universe one day.\n\nWhat he's worried about, mostly, is the expansion of the Boys franchise beyond the original series, and the way it echoes the Vought Cinematic Universe of the show. \"I say it all the time to people on a lot of calls, like, our brand is punk rock,\" he says. \"We deserve extra scorn if we sell out.\" In addition to the animated anthology Diabolical, the show already spawned a successful live-action spinoff, Gen-V, set at a college for supes in the Boys universe. As Kripke speaks, the latter show is days away from starting production on its second season, but an unexpected tragedy has irrevocably altered it: One of the leads, Chance Perdomo, died in a motorcycle accident in late March. \"First and foremost, it's just an incredible tragedy, just horrific,\" Kripke says. \"And my heart goes out to his family. He was a 27-year-old kid, and it's awful. That takes precedence over everything. Losing someone's really hard. What we do is writing on paper. It's easy.\" The writers decided not to recast the role. \"Chance can't be replaced. We had written the first four scripts, and so we're revising them furiously to to make sure it's a new storyline that really honors the character. But as you can imagine, that's major changes.\"\n\nThere are multiple other possible spinoffs in the works, including something called The Boys Mexico. \"No one's pushing us to come up with these shows,\" Kripke says. \"We're pushing ourselves, because we love the world. It's so fun to play in. So we inevitably chat about what corners of the world would be interesting. And we just let those things evolve.\"\n\nThe Boys will end with Season Five, and Kripke seems to know where it's all headed. \"I have an ending in mind, I'll say that,\" he says. \"I want it to be satisfying, right? I mean, you could count the great series finales on one hand. So it's a real hard target. And I would want it to be emotionally satisfying but also surprising in how I'm delivering it.\"\n\nBefore the actors got definitive word that they were only getting one more season, some of them wanted it to go on as long as possible, even as they recognized how hard that would've been. \"I feel like one thing that we've been able to do is not be repetitive,\" says Laz Alonso, whose tough-guy-with-OCD character, Mother's Milk, takes over from Butcher as leader of the Boys in the new season. \"That's tough, especially when you strike a chord that people like -- you want to give them what they come for. But at the same time, you don't want to start repeating old jokes, old schticks. You still want to be able to get those 'oh shit I didn't see that coming' moments -- and that's tough.\"\n\nKripke hints that the show's ending could be a happy one, even if that comes with some serious sacrifice. \"Anything worth having is worth fighting for,\" he says. Unlike the bleak, only-the-good-die-young world of, say, Game of Thrones, he believes he's ultimately presided over \"a moral universe where when you choose love, family, and mercy, good things happen to you.\"\n\nIf there's a bigger message amidst all of the show's lurid horrors, it's this: \"We're trying to deconstruct the notion that a hero can solve the world's ills in one grand, dramatic fell swoop,\" Kripke says, dropping his usual air of wryness for a moment. \"That's just not how life works.

Created by Eric Kripke, The Boys has become a global phenomenon since its premiere in 2019, with even a successful spinoff series Gen V debuting last September.\n\nActor Antony Starr plays Homelander, the central superhero for the strategic business conglomerate Vought International, whose longtime quiet insecurities start to unravel within the public eye, as he sometimes tries to do the right thing, with it often backfiring. One of his sidekicks in the once-coveted (and now somewhat tarnished) \"The Seven\" superheroes team, The Deep, is played by Chace Crawford. Heading into this fourth season, I asked these gentlemen what they are enjoying most about their characters' journey so far on The Boys.\n\nStarr said, \"I don't think either of these characters have got a redemption that's going to be satisfying for any audience members. What I love about this job and this character is where we get to go with it because we've inverted the superhero universe, so all the morals are upside down, which gives us the freedom to go anywhere. We can literally go anywhere and every time we come back, every episode I read, I'm just like, Okay, we're going there? Great. There's nowhere that we can't go. We're not bound to anything that superhero narratives are bound to - that's my favorite part of the show and the character is I never know what's coming - I just get to enjoy it.\"\n\nCrawford added: \"Part of what I enjoy most about The Deep is there really is no evolution. He kind of always ends up where he started, which is great, but I did like season two when he goes on a journey of self-discovery, even though he was just kind of being punished and sort of going through the motions and jumping through the hoops of like, Oh, I got to change. The concept that he's so inept at relationships and human connection, that the fact that he has to have a mistress that is an octopus is so funny, but also play it real is just like my sense of humor.\"\n\nOne the other side of the fight is Annie January, better known as Starlight and played by Erin Moriarty, a \"supe\" (as they call them on the series) trying to not only stop more destruction from happening in the world, but also yearns to just get to be Annie for once this season.\n\nWhen speaking about her character's evolution in season four, Moriarty said, \"It's ironic, isn't it, because she wants to be Annie, and yet, she kind of can't. The world expects her to be Starlight, and they want her to forever take on that persona because that's what she has become notorious for and she's resistant to it, for obvious reasons and justified reasons. Then, she becomes Annie and that forces out the real truth, and the stuff that she's not dealt with comes to the surface and she realizes that she doesn't even know who Annie is.\"\n\nOne of Annie's supportive allies alongside her in the fight is Kimiko, played by Karen Fukuhara, who has the extraordinary ability to heal fast from the worst of injuries. In the new season, Kimiko has an intriguing arc, as she learns about and has to deal with her unsettling origin story.\n\nFukuhara said, \"I love the new information that comes in every season - every episode even. It's surprising because as an actor, we always try to humanize our characters. Even if we are playing someone that's a villain or evil, we try to justify our own actions and not judge - in the same way, I've done for Kimiko.\" She added: \"I think even the heroic characters on our show have darker sides to them and that's what makes the show unique.\"\n\nArguably, no one is more enigmatic on the series in season four than Victoria Neuman, played by Claudia Doumit, a \"closeted\" superhero who is running to become the next U.S. Vice President. Being also a protective mother and a character that comes from a strict upbringing, Doumit said of Neuman, \"I don't think she's evil - I don't think she's either on the good side - I think she's a deeply flawed human being and I think that's so relatable. I think that's what is so interesting about her and that's why I enjoy playing her, because nobody fully exists in all good, all bad. The fun thing about this season especially was the exploration of her figuring where that line is - like how far is she willing to go.\"\n\nFresh faces this season include the character Sage, played by Susan Heyward, whose superpower is having the smartest brain in the world. Homelander soon finds an interest in her abilities, as she becomes a vital asset in his self-centered plans.\n\nHeyward said of joining this already strong ensemble cast in season four, \"In a world where people are so outlandish and sometimes cartoonish, I really wanted Sage to - she's a bit of a mystery. She doesn't put everything she wants out there. She's not necessarily scraping for power. She's very much someone who works behind-the-scenes and creates the situation where she can reign.\"\n\nValorie Curry also joins The Boys this season as Firecracker, an outspoken superhero that promotes conspiracies and uses her religion as both a protection and a weapon within her publicly shared comments.\n\nCurry said of Firecracker, \"She is so outlandish. She is such a commentary on so many people that we hear from everyday. I wanted to really bring her emotional vulnerability - it's very close to the surface for her - this pain, this volatility, this deep-wounding and her willingness to access that and show it at any point that serves her.\"\n\nA character that has been surviving more than thriving over the past four seasons is Ashley Barrett. Going from Vought assistant to PR executive would seem like a happy journey, but being a human at the beck and call of superheroes like Homelander has been a quiet misery for a character desperate to hold onto whatever professional power she actually has. Played by Colby Minifie, I wondered if the actor has ever had real world PR or publicist friends ever say that they understand her stressed out character in this \"damage control\" line of work.\n\nMinifie said, \"That's a great question. I have had some PR people be like, 'Yeah, it's really intense' - but I have never met a publicist that behaves the way that Ashley behaves. Maybe they behave that way in their personal lives, the way that Ashley does. I have been treated like, 'Oh, you're so great. You're so wonderful. This is why we love you - this is great' and that sucks, but that's the only time that I met a publicist that is vaguely like Ashley.\"\n\nAs I concluded my conversations with the actors behind these troubled characters on The Boys, I was curious what each of them would say to their on-screen personas, after embodying them up to this point so far, if only they could.\n\nCrawford started with his message for The Deep, \"Go back to the ocean - just leave. It's not going to happen for you, buddy. Just go right back - the only chance at being happy is getting in that ocean.\"\n\nStarr said of Homelander and The Deep, \"I would sit us both down, I would say look at me, make eye contact and I would hold our faces and say, 'You are enough.'\"\n\nMoriarty said of Starlight, \"I would say keep going. Persevere. Trust yourself - keep going.\"\n\nFukuhara said of Kimiko, \"Just leave, girl!\"\n\nDoumit said of Neuman, \"Leave is a good one. Take your daughter and get the hell out of town. Go! You and her - that's it. None of it matters.\"\n\nCurry said of Firecracker, \"Therapy and I don't know - I'd take away her phone.\"\n\nMinifie said of Barrett, \"Is it really worth it, honey?\"\n\nHeyward said of Sage, \"I would say to Sage the exact opposite thing of Colby - it's absolutely worth it. You've been waiting your whole life for this. Wherever you decide to go, it's worth it.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Annie (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antony Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chace_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chace Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gen V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Kripke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Kripke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidekick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sidekick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good and evil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Doumit", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Doumit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Fukuhara", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Fukuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Moriarty_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erin Moriarty (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closeted", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closeted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Octopus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Minifie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colby Minifie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valorie_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valorie Curry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Human_Interaction", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Human Interaction", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/666b19fe45840867bbea1bee/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9648949", "eventUri": "eng-9648949", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

It was an episode that had some major surprise cameos, as well as some unexpected storytelling reveals.\n\nHowever, three episodes dropping at once is a tall order for any series - read below for a recap and reminder of why The Boys Season 4 Episode 2 stood out!\n\nThe Boys Season 4 Episode 2 Recap (Spoilers)\n\nSuper Boyz N' Tha Hood - The opening of Episode 2 takes us on a jarring jump back in time to an inner city housing project. a local crew of drug dealers is handling business as usual - until a speedy blur reveals Reggie Franklin before his days as A-Train (Jessie T. Usher), serving as a literal runner for the dealers. A car pulls up and Reggie's high school coach steps out, played by none other than Will Ferrell (a righteous cameo). Coach tries to get Reggie to come back to the sport, offering his own home as a place for Reggie to escape the street life. Dramatic music swells as Coach gives his motivational monologue, but Reggie can't be moved by it, stating he'll never be free of \"these streets.\" Next thing we hear is \"Cut!\" and the sepia-toned scene transitions into the usual washed-out colors of The Boys, and we see that \"Dawn of the Seven\" movie director Adam Bourke (P.J. Byrne) is directing his latest film, \"Training A-Train.\" Bourke lays it on thick for Ferrell, who is worried he's giving off \"Blindside vibes.\" Bourke says that he already smells an Oscar nomination and Ferrell leaves happy; A-Train is not happy with the dramatic take on his life, a his brother was his only coach (not a white man), and that same brother/coach worked as a waiter, not a crack dealer. It's clear that A-Train is not happy with the offensive depiction of his story, but is powerless to stop it. He retires to his trailer for a breather - or at least tries to.\n\nWhat's My Motivation? - The new (more talkative) Black Noir shows up outside A-Train's trailer, revealing that he's an actor playing Noir. That actor is walking a razor-thin line, as even the most method techniques aren't helping him get over murdering three men on Homelander's orders (including M.M.'s ex-wife's new man, Todd). \"Noir,\" comes to A-Train to get the motivation needed to get deeper into character; A-Train gets nasty, saying his motivation is being a brain-dead maniac, and orders him to keep his mouth shut and play his part.\n\nShe is MOTHER - Hughie is in an awkward, emotionally charged conversation with his mom (Rosemarie DeWitt). He finds out that his dad and mom were talking again for a year or more, and that his dad left her power of attorney over him and Hughie. That news shocks Hughie, who storms out, despite his mom promising she is good in a crisis and will help his father.\n\nSquad With Issues - Frenchie (Tomer Capone) wakes up in bed with Colin, his old flame from addiction recovery. Colin catches Frenchie trying to sneak away, but when they start being intimate again, Frenchie's phone starts going off and he solemnly confirms it's \"work.\" Meanwhile, Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) is off on her own, in a therapy session. Her doctor asks about how her vocal therapy is going and Kimiko sarcastically replies (via text msg) that it's obviously not going well. But, when the doctor begins to dig into Kimiko's family history and parental relationship as possible reasons for her muteness, she freaks out, crushes the arm of her chair, and storms out of the office. Back at Boys HQ, Butcher is coming clean about his terminal diagnosis, which rattles the group. M.M. takes Butcher out into the hallway and shockingly demands that he leave the group. Butcher is pissed that his honesty is being met this way, but M.M. holds the line and banishes him, claiming he's now a major liability.\n\n[The Boys Logo Flashes Over Vought]\n\nMarketing Homeboy - Vought's PR team does a presentation pitching Ryan's official debut as \"Homeboy,\" complete with a matching Homelander-style costume. Ashley and all the yes people in the room celebrate the debut, but Sister Sage (Susan Heyward) drops the truth bomb that it's a lame marketing ploy. She argues that Star Wars and other pop-culture media has trained the masses to resonate with a lone \"chosen one\" white male archetype - meaning Ryan has to build an image independent of being \"Homelander's Son.\" Homelander's ego has trouble giving up the limelight, but Sage reminds him the goal is legacy, and building a \"kingdom for your son.\" Homelander signs off on the approach, but is clearly a bit unhinged about it. As Sage gets into the elevator, Ashley (Colby Minifie) tries to intercept her, warning about how fragile Homelander's ego is. But Sage can see how Ashley has gone bald from her anxiety working with Homelander, and advises she try breastfeeding him like Madelyn Stillwell (Elisabeth Shue) used to. The Deep (Chace Crawford) enters the elevator and pitches joining Ryan on his first \"solo save.\" Ashley can barely contain her disrespect before she steps off the elevator. Sage gasses The Deep up, telling him not to be disrespected by his lessers (humans), and that being at Ryan's save is a good idea.\n\nInvestigating Sage - The Boys are analyzing the murders of the three Homelander fans during his recent trial and the riot that ensued afterward. Hughie is bitter about Butcher being out; M.M. is focused on Sister Sage, who he saw leading his ex-wife's partner Todd and the other men to their slaughter. They hack Sage's phone and discover plans for her to attend a Vought event in Harrisburg, PA, that night. Starlight and Hughie decide to hang back and press A-Train for a confession and keep watch on Hughie's sick father (respectively).\n\nSolo Save (Practice Round) - The Deep and Black Noir work with Ryan and a team of company grunts on a training scenario for his upcoming first solo save. Ryan gets the heroic speech down, but when they re-watch the session on video, there are definite notes (like Black Noir talking too much). Homelander gives Ryan instructions on how to 'sell the save,' while assuring him that staged saves are part of the business - but not all saves are fake. Deep and Ashley have a confrontation about the elevator, in which The Deep finally snaps and gets vilely aggressive with Ashley, threatening her life. Deep is clearly enamored with his newfound sense of power. Homelander overhears the marketing boys discussing how they had to de-age him through VFX for \"Dawn of the Seven,\" while Ryan is a glowing fresh face. Again, it's clear that Homelander isn't able to share the spotlight easily.\n\nWelcome to Truth - M.M., Frenchie, and Kimiko arrive at the hotel in Harrisburg where the Vought event will be held, and find Butcher is already there, helping himself to the buffet. Butcher reveals that he easily hacked M.M. computer password (his daughter's name and birth year); M.M. tries to bounce Butcher off the operation, but Butcher leans into his new status as a private citizen convening with his fellow alt-rights wary off the \"Deep State.\" Inside \"Truthcon\" it is a conspiracy theorist/extremist party, with everything from propaganda claiming Starlight is akin to the Devil, or that Stormfront is still alive. Kimiko is triggered by a flyer alleging there are children prisoners being experimented on - something she knows is all too true. The Boys spot Sister Sage, and pursue; Kimiko raids a fridge to binge-drink some beers.\n\nMeet Firecracker - Sage attends a panel hosted by Alex Jones-ish supe podcaster \"Firecracker\" (Valorie Curry), with M.M., Butcher, and Frenchie also slipping into the crowd. As Firecracker begins her panel spewing pro-Homelander conspiracy theories, Butcher looks visibly ill from his condition. Kimiko slips in, and she and Frenchie talk about how and why anyone would believe this tripe.\n\nGet It In Myself - Frenchie and Kimiko leave to tail one of Firecracker's roadies, Splinter (Rob Benedict) who slipped away. Frenchie is distracted by a text from Colin and Kimiko steals his phone and sexts back, urging Frenchie to go for what he wants. Frenchie realizes that she's drunk, but Kimiko keeps going, telling him she slept with a barista and he should get some as well. Frenchie keeps telling her it's not an issue with them, and they resume the pursuit, with Kimiko confessing she's even drunker than he thinks. In a locker room they discover the horrific sight of Splinter, a supe able to make copies of himself, in a steam room pleasuring himself (oral to anal) in a perverse human centipede line while holding a picture of Firecracker. They leave promptly.\n\nPolitical Power - Annie (Erin Moriarty) and Hughie are staking out A-Train, with Annie unwilling to fully step into the persona of \"Starlight\" as a political leader. Hughie wants her to inspire hope, but Annie thinks \"Starlight\" is too tainted of a symbol. A-Train is talking to his nephews about his heroic exploits, and they look up to him when a fan stops him for a selfie. A-Train's brother Nathan (Christian Keyes) rolls up in his wheelchair, furious that his sons snuck off with their estranged uncle. Nathan shoots down A-Train's hero stories, exposing that many of them were fake Vought movie productions. A-Train still can't admit it, by Nathan tells his sons that their uncle is no hero, and all his saves were fake. The boys leave with Nathan, while A-Train tries to apologize. The speedster runs off, leaving Hughie and Starlight staring after him.\n\nRecruiting Crackers - Sister Sage approaches Firecracker after her panel, claiming to speak for Homelander. Sage asks Firecracker what she's selling to the gullible masse; after some implied racism and reciting her public mantra, Firecracker admits that she's selling the idea of \"purpose\" to a group that feels increasingly rudderless and disenfranchised. That \"truth bomb\" is enough for Sage to invite her to a secret gathering later that night.\n\nButcher vs Marvin - Butcher and M.M. are recording the entire conversation between Sage and Firecracker. However, the two former BFFs get into it when Butcher wants to kill Sage on the spot; M.M. pushes him outside the venue, reminding Butcher that surveillance is their mission. All the history between from Seasons 1-3 (and beyond) comes spilling out, and Butcher madly invites the fight by calling out M.M. as a weak leader. A comment about M.M.s wife gets Butcher his beatdown; M.M. angrily confesses that he took the position so he and Butcher could get back to doing what they loved to do together, but that's ruined now. M.M. leaves Butcher and heads back inside.\n\nEnough Cap! - Drunk Kimiko becomes enraged at the child trafficking political conspiracy booth and tears it down, hurling its owner across the floor. As would-be warriors start to swarm, Frenchie arrives and pulls Kimiko away, urging her not to lose it. Back in NYC, Hughie and Annie find A-Train waiting for them at Boys HQ. A-Train mocks Starlight's angry flare-up and hands them a flash-drive clearing Starlight's followers o the Homelander Trial murders. Before A-Train speeds off he confesses he knew they were watching him and the footage he's sharing is a thank you for not embarrassing him in front of his family.\n\nHis Name Is Ryan - Ryan's staged \"solo save\" is unfolding in the streets, with The Deep and Black Noir pretending to be helpless against the \"robber\" (the same coach from the training session) who is holding a young girl at gunpoint. Ryan flies in and grabs the gunman's arm as planned - but when he goes to formally drop the one-liner announcing his name, he's upstaged by his dad. Homelander goes on to deliver a monologue about how they are going to save America as father and son, then commands Ryan to push the robber away - which Ryan does way too hard, splattering his coach against a wall. The girl (an actress) tries to stay in character, but Ryan is visibly traumatized. Homelander steps in and takes his son under his arm, commanding him to smile.\n\nIt's A Trap! - M.M., Kimiko, and Frenchie get to the room where Sister Sage is supposed to meet with Firecracker, only to find it's a trap. Sage of course knew who they were (CIA and Supe-Killers) and that they were after her; she tells Firecracker it's her audition for Team Homelander to kill The Boys. Firecracker and Splinter hold The Boys at gunpoint, but Frenchie notices one of Splinter's doubles has Pink Eye from the earlier sexual centipede session. The Boys spring into action, killing Splinter's doubles while Kimiko takes on Firecracker. Splinter starts splinting into naked doubles of himself, so M.M. and Frenchie flee into the next convention room, a Bat Mitzvah. The party goers scream when a horde of naked, gun-toting Splinters enters, and Firecracker and Kimiko come crashing through the wall. Everyone runs out of bullets, so it becomes a melee race to kill the Splinters before they can replicate. Kimiko takes a bullet to the head and is incapacitated; Firecracker tries to use the moment to go live and expose the CIA, but Butcher arrives with a crowbar and takes her out, as well as a fair amount of Splinters. Butcher is overrun, but Kimiko, Frenchie, and M.M. recover, and together they fight off Splinter long enough for Butcher to kill \"Prime\" Splinter, ending the entire horde. Firecracker runs away, defeated, after the clones confess they loved her.\n\nNot So Heroic - Ryan is in Homelander's penthouse, sobbing, while his dad brings him a milkshake. Homelander thinks that Ryan is sad that he upstaged him, but Ryan is sad that he killed his coach. Homelander (in his sociopathic way) tries to explain that humans are like ants, and toys that break, but Ryan clearly has much more empathy (like his mom). Homelander insists that he is one of the \"chosen\" and must accept that fate while taking away Ryan's milkshake.\n\nPolitical Power - Annie and Hughie are at a rally for the exonerated Starlighters they saved. Annie says that A-Train's bravery has made her question her own, and she ignites her light in front of the crowd, signaling that she's ready to be a true political symbol for her followers.\n\nDark Ties Bind - Frenchie is relapsing with alcohol and drugs, ignoring Colin's calls. He gets in contact with his arms dealer confidant \"Cherie\" (Jordana Lajoie), and confesses a dark truth: he knows Colin as the son of a judge he assassinated - along with Colin's entire family. Cherie is mad at \"Serge\" for once again chasing strays. Meanwhile, Hughie awkwardly storms in on his mom, and declares that she's not allowed to come back and act in charge; he tells her about the trauma of the day she left him, and threatens legal action against her power of attorney if she doesn't run all decisions by him. Daphne is heartbroken over the rage she's put in her son. At Boys HQ, Kimiko is stewing over a lead on the cabal of human traffickers that kidnapped her and heads out to do something about it. Butcher returns to HQ, and he and M.M. talk about what the real cost of leadership is. Butcher says that M.M. not making the most ruthless play (kidnapping or killing Sage) nearly got the team killed; he also admits that he only has time left for one mission: saving Ryan from Homelander, and needs M.M. to do it. Marvin doesn't take the olive branch, claiming it's too little, too late. Butcher leaves, looking hurt.\n\n[End Credits]\n\nThe Boys Season 4 is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenchie_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frenchie (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE_Publishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "SAGE Publishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Train", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A-Train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Ferrell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Will Ferrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elevator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

He also has a crush on the firebrand political commentator, which is where things get weird.\n\nHalfway through Firecracker ranting about a fake conspiracy concerning good supe Starlight being part of a \"Satanic delivery service\", and having a brief chat with Sage, Splinter heads out to a locker room with Frenchie and Kimiko keeping an eye on him.\n\nWhen the pair investigate, with the supe's clothes abandoned on a bench, they hear grunting behind a door at the back, which they open to find Splinter -

The first three episodes that dropped on June 13 establish a surprising new dynamic among our titular heroes now that de facto leader Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) is battling the fatal side-effects of blasting Compound V last season and Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) is hellbent on bouncing him from the fight. Hughie (Jack Quaid) is distracted with his father's stroke and the re-appearance of his mother (Rosemarie DeWitt), new team member Annie (Erin Moriarty) is at the center of a Vought-crazed \"patriots\"-vs-Starlighters tragedy, Frenchie (Tomer Capon) is getting his Pride on, and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) has stumbled upon a chapter from her past that, well, ends in a Boys-level amount of carnage.\n\nAt the same time, chaos is reigning over at Vought, where Homelander (Antony Starr) has been forced to take on some new recruits for the Seven, including Qanon-ish conspiracy-feeder Firecracker (Valorie Curry) and Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), who is both the most intelligent being on the planet and the least cuddly. On top of that, he's also trying to groom his son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) into embracing the darkest side of his supe skills, a new Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) can't get down the quiet part of his gig, The Deep (Chase Crawford) is torn between surf and turf (IYKYK) and A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) is showing signs of wear-and-tear when it comes to the supergroup's alt-right bent. There's also the world's most horrifying ice-skating show, a surprise reveal about America's favorite Vought News Network star, Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison) and the usual amount of H.R. nightmares for amoral Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie).\n\nJasper Savage / Prime Video\n\nAll of this, in three episodes? Here, showrunner Eric Kripke talks about the tone of this very topical season, whether he'll get his ol' Supernatural pal Jared Padalecki on the show before it ends, having roped Jeffrey Dean Morgan into a recurring gig this season as a CIA agent working with Butcher, and what went into Episode 402's incredibly naked fight sequence.\n\nWell, congratulations on the new season and the big announcement.\n\nEric Kripke: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThat actually must feel really relaxing now.\n\nYes. I mean, we've known for years and years, and it was absolutely stressful, especially in the last round of press for the show, that I couldn't just say it and I had to say like, \"I don't know how long it's going to go!\" We were just waiting for all the final approvals that you need to announce something like that. And so I'm just happy to finally get the word out. And I think it helps the viewing experience now; you can understand the shape of it and where you are in the story, and it helps. I think this season makes a little more sense in terms of why we're making some of the moves we're making.\n\nAnd this season definitely feels like your most emotional season off the jump.\n\nI'm from a network TV background and my training is \"smoke if you got 'em.\" That world where I lived or died by my Nielsen ratings every week, so I didn't have the luxury of waiting. And look, that instinct can sometimes be a little manic, I'll acknowledge, but I really feel when you're in the entertainment business, it's important to be as entertaining as you can be, as often as you can be.\n\nJasper Savage/Prime Video\n\nComing into the season, we knew that there had to be some kind of dynamics shift within the Boys themselves, but you've really kind of reshuffled the power of who's running the show...\n\nIt just felt like at this point in the story, it just started to feel like the characters would be insane to keep trusting Butcher after everything he's done to them every year. [Laughs] He needed to be pushed out and have to fight to get back in while his clock is really ticking. And again, how long could Starlight stay with Vought after all the horrific things? So part of it is just trusting the characters and listening to them, because in a weird way, they do sort of tell you where they want to go and how they would react.\n\nIt's is interesting to see where they start to see that maybe there are other people in The Seven that aren't so happy with the infrastructure, while you're also rebuilding the team. Sister Sage is great, because she's literally the only person who can go up against Homelander.\n\nAnd a huge part of that is Susan Heyward and the absolutely stunning performance she gives. But it was really fun to have that kind of superhero because anytime we can find a classic superhero archetype and do our spin on it, that's a winner. And we hadn't done one where, you know there's all those in comic books just where someone's just brilliant? Like, that's their thing. And so what is our world's version of that? And a bunch of overeducated writers quickly came to the conclusion of, oh, she'd be miserable. [Laughs]\n\nJasper Savage/Prime Video\n\nAnd you're never going to go wrong with bringing Valorie Currie into any game.\n\nShe's so good and funny and we give her the most outrageous s**t to say as Firecracker. And she just commits 120 percent to it. I love her performance so much. Pound for pound, she makes me laugh as much as anybody. And she can be scary, she can be vulnerable.\n\nThe scene at TruthCon, where Sage asks what she's selling, I mean...\n\nYeah. I mean, perfect. We always want to write the characters as human as we can, even ones as outrageous as Firecracker.\n\nSpeaking of that second episode...can we talk about the Rob Benedict of it all? You're literally putting the \"dick\" in Rob Benedict. How long have you been wanting to have him Human Centipede himself?\n\n[Laughs] Since the day I met him. No. We were playing around with this notion of clone sex and what an ultimate act of masturbation that would be. Then I heard that Rob was interested in going out for the role, so I said, \"We have to stop for a minute. I need to call him. I need to explain exactly what he's getting himself into.\" Because none of that was in the audition pages, obviously. And so I walked him through it and I explained all the butt-eating and all the nudity, and he thought it was hilarious. He was excited. To be clear, that's not really his penis. That's an eight-day fight sequence.\n\nEight days?!\n\nYeah. So that was a prosthetic. He is basically wearing a speedo or a thong perhaps with a prosthetic penis glued to the front, which I don't know if that makes it better or worse...[Laughs]\n\nCourtesy of Prime Video\n\nSince we now know that the end is near, you've got Jeffrey Dean Morgan coming in for this perfect pairing with Karl Urban. Those two could be literally from the same DNA pool. You've had Jensen, Jared [Padalecki] is now available. People are going to ask, is the idea of Season 5 just bring out all of the big guns?\n\nNo, it'll be whatever's right for story. I mean, look, I definitely want to get Jared in there. I feel like that would be one I would love to do. Like I've said, I'm completing my game of Supernatural Pokemon. But the truth is, I just like working with people that I like, and Supernatural just happens to be chockfull of people that have remained dear friends of mine. And if I had to choose between someone I didn't know and a good friend and they're both talented, I'll pick the person I know and love every time. So part of it is just I like working with family.\n\nRelatedThe 25 Best Prime Video Original Series, Ranked\n\nAll right, nice. I've got to wrap you, but last question: I know people are talking about the themes and the topics that you tackle on the season. What was the vibe you wanted for this season?\n\nBecause it's the penultimate season, I wanted it to be the one where you dig deepest into the characters and you really got to understand really what makes them all tick. So then they can launch into the final season and you'll care that much more about them. So this was meant to be -- not that it's a quiet season -- but this is meant to be a more introspective season than the other ones, sort of that end-of-Act Two low point before you take off for the rollercoaster ride of Act Three.\n\nThe Boys, Thursdays, Prime Video\n\nMore Headlines:\n\n'The Boys': Eric Kripke on Ending With Season 5, Jared Padalecki Hopes & Emotional Arcs'Wheel of Fortune': Pat Sajak Gets Ryan Seacrest Ready to Host This Fall in New Promo (VIDEO)Griffin Dunne's Memoir: 5 Shocking Revelations About Dominique Dunne's Tragic Death'Starfleet Academy' Casts Paul Giamatti: Everything We Know About New 'Star Trek' SeriesWhen Is the 'Jeopardy!'

House of the Dragon will be back this weekend, and new episodes of Bridgerton and The Boys dropped overnight. When it comes to that Regency-era romance, the show's longest sex scene has viewers salivating, and a corresponding The Boys scene doesn't exactly boast the same variety of longevity (or consent), but it is nonetheless also sparking reactions.\n\nThis scene harkens back to Homelander's deep twin loves of commanding people to do his bidding and also humiliating the heck out of Deep. Last season, viewers were beside themselves when Antony Starr's character forced Chace Crawford's Aquaman parody to eat his best friend, Timothy the Octopus, while the marine mollusk was still alive. This was a revolting power trip from Homelander, who will not change his ways, even if he grows visibly bored during his sadistic power moves.\n\nAs the fourth season of the Prime Video (Amazon) series began, Homelander decided -- simply because he could -- to order Deep to get on his knees and service A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) during a meeting of The Seven. Neither participant was into it, obviously.\n\nThis is a callback to Deep forcing Starlight to perform the same act on him during the first season, but also, look at the reaction from Ashley (Colby Minifie) before Homelander relents and calls off the act.

If anything, America itself has lost any notion of subtlety or self-awareness, so it'd make sense for 'The Boys' to reflect that in its own way. For much of Season 4, the Boys are now firmly working on a single plan - assassinate the Vice President, who is in fact a closeted Supe and is working hand-in-hand with Homelander. Again, subtlety was never on the cards, and so it goes that the new members of The Seven include a far-right extremist broadcaster called Firecracker.\n\nIf that's not enough, there's an entire episode set inside TruthCon - a far-right conspiracy theorist convention which holds stalls that worship Stormfront as a race-purifying martyr, believes Soldier Boy is being kept in a CIA prison, and plenty of other whack-a-doo beliefs that aren't a million miles away from the kind of bullshit espoused by some followers of the current frontrunner for the US presidency. What 'The Boys' makes clear is that for Firecracker, played with real aplomb by Valorie Curry, has nothing going on that could be construed as genuine beliefs. It's a calculation based on the prevailing winds and packaging a story that puts the most dangerous people in the centre of a make-believe war where they're the army of light. There are precious few shows out there that would make a point of going right at the problem like 'The Boys'.\n\nKarl Urban's character, Billy Butcher, has an edge of vulnerability to him in this season as he struggles not only with trying to wrest his estranged son away from Homelander's influence, but also is dealing with his own terminal illness. Likewise, Jack Quaid's character Hughie must learn to deal with the reappearance of his mother, played by Rosemarie DeWitt, as his father, played by Simon Pegg, falls ill. 'The Boys' has always been clever in how it portrays superheroes as having celebrity as their superpower, and si to goes on here. Homelander is beginning to show signs of aging and is trying to grapple with his son replacing him. Starlight pushes and pulls with her own celebrity and her platform, while A-Train finds himself crushed under the weight of spectacle and how his life has been effectively scripted from the start.\n\nAll this complex drama aside, 'The Boys' is as brutal and f*cked-up as ever. There's a particularly bizarre fight sequence involving a self-cloning supe fighting naked inside a themed bat mitzvah and pink-eye plays a part in the whole encounter. The Deep's octopus girlfriend is voiced by a particularly well-known British thesp. Will Ferrell turns up as himself at one point in a starring role in an in-universe movie that bears uncomfortable resemblance to 'The Blind Side' with Sandra Bullock. Flying farm animals and impervious super-chickens feature at one point. Hell, the entire plot of this whole season is about a CIA plot to assassinate the Vice President and wipe out Supes entirely. You might say this was ever thus for 'The Boys', but it feels as though the guardrails have come off in more ways than one this season.\n\nSnarling, angry, acidic in its satire, indiscriminate in its targets, the fourth season of 'The Boys' makes no qualms about trying to piss off anyone and everyone it can.

The first three episodes that dropped on June 13 establish a surprising new dynamic among our titular heroes now that de facto leader Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) is battling the fatal side-effects of blasting Compound V last season and Mother's Milk (Laz Alonso) is hellbent on bouncing him from the fight. Hughie (Jack Quaid) is distracted with his father's stroke and the re-appearance of his mother (Rosemarie DeWitt), new team member Annie (Erin Moriarty) is at the center of a Vought-crazed \"patriots\"-vs-Starlighters tragedy, Frenchie (Tomer Capon) is getting his Pride on, and Kimiko (Karen Fukuhara) has stumbled upon a chapter from her past that, well, ends in a Boys-level amount of carnage.\n\nAt the same time, chaos is reigning over at Vought, where Homelander (Antony Starr) has been forced to take on some new recruits for the Seven, including Qanon-ish conspiracy-feeder Firecracker (Valorie Curry) and Sister Sage (Susan Heyward), who is both the most intelligent being on the planet and the least cuddly. On top of that, he's also trying to groom his son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) into embracing the darkest side of his supe skills, a new Black Noir (Nathan Mitchell) can't get down the quiet part of his gig, The Deep (Chase Crawford) is torn between surf and turf (IYKYK) and A-Train (Jessie T. Usher) is showing signs of wear-and-tear when it comes to the supergroup's alt-right bent. There's also the world's most horrifying ice-skating show, a surprise reveal about America's favorite Vought News Network star, Cameron Coleman (Matthew Edison) and the usual amount of H.R. nightmares for amoral Ashley Barrett (Colby Minifie).\n\nJasper Savage / Prime Video\n\nAll of this, in three episodes? Here, showrunner Eric Kripke talks about the tone of this very topical season, whether he'll get his ol' Supernatural pal Jared Padalecki on the show before it ends, having roped Jeffrey Dean Morgan into a recurring gig this season as a CIA agent working with Butcher, and what went into Episode 402's incredibly naked fight sequence.\n\nWell, congratulations on the new season and the big announcement.\n\nEric Kripke: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nThat actually must feel really relaxing now.\n\nYes. I mean, we've known for years and years, and it was absolutely stressful, especially in the last round of press for the show, that I couldn't just say it and I had to say like, \"I don't know how long it's going to go!\" We were just waiting for all the final approvals that you need to announce something like that. And so I'm just happy to finally get the word out. And I think it helps the viewing experience now; you can understand the shape of it and where you are in the story, and it helps. I think this season makes a little more sense in terms of why we're making some of the moves we're making.\n\nAnd this season definitely feels like your most emotional season off the jump.\n\nI'm from a network TV background and my training is \"smoke if you got 'em.\" That world where I lived or died by my Nielsen ratings every week, so I didn't have the luxury of waiting. And look, that instinct can sometimes be a little manic, I'll acknowledge, but I really feel when you're in the entertainment business, it's important to be as entertaining as you can be, as often as you can be.\n\nJasper Savage/Prime Video\n\nComing into the season, we knew that there had to be some kind of dynamics shift within the Boys themselves, but you've really kind of reshuffled the power of who's running the show...\n\nIt just felt like at this point in the story, it just started to feel like the characters would be insane to keep trusting Butcher after everything he's done to them every year. [Laughs] He needed to be pushed out and have to fight to get back in while his clock is really ticking. And again, how long could Starlight stay with Vought after all the horrific things? So part of it is just trusting the characters and listening to them, because in a weird way, they do sort of tell you where they want to go and how they would react.\n\nIt's is interesting to see where they start to see that maybe there are other people in The Seven that aren't so happy with the infrastructure, while you're also rebuilding the team. Sister Sage is great, because she's literally the only person who can go up against Homelander.\n\nAnd a huge part of that is Susan Heyward and the absolutely stunning performance she gives. But it was really fun to have that kind of superhero because anytime we can find a classic superhero archetype and do our spin on it, that's a winner. And we hadn't done one where, you know there's all those in comic books just where someone's just brilliant? Like, that's their thing. And so what is our world's version of that? And a bunch of overeducated writers quickly came to the conclusion of, oh, she'd be miserable. [Laughs]\n\nJasper Savage/Prime Video\n\nAnd you're never going to go wrong with bringing Valorie Currie into any game.\n\nMore from this section A Greek Recipe For Romance Actors Who Were Replaced After Suffering Unfortunate Injuries Jude Law's Hilarious teenage dorm mix-up!\n\nShe's so good and funny and we give her the most outrageous s**t to say as Firecracker. And she just commits 120 percent to it. I love her performance so much. Pound for pound, she makes me laugh as much as anybody. And she can be scary, she can be vulnerable.\n\nThe scene at TruthCon, where Sage asks what she's selling, I mean...\n\nYeah. I mean, perfect. We always want to write the characters as human as we can, even ones as outrageous as Firecracker.\n\nSpeaking of that second episode...can we talk about the Rob Benedict of it all? You're literally putting the \"dick\" in Rob Benedict. How long have you been wanting to have him Human Centipede himself?\n\n[Laughs] Since the day I met him. No. We were playing around with this notion of clone sex and what an ultimate act of masturbation that would be. Then I heard that Rob was interested in going out for the role, so I said, \"We have to stop for a minute. I need to call him. I need to explain exactly what he's getting himself into.\" Because none of that was in the audition pages, obviously. And so I walked him through it and I explained all the butt-eating and all the nudity, and he thought it was hilarious. He was excited. To be clear, that's not really his penis. That's an eight-day fight sequence.\n\nEight days?!\n\nYeah. So that was a prosthetic. He is basically wearing a speedo or a thong perhaps with a prosthetic penis glued to the front, which I don't know if that makes it better or worse...[Laughs]\n\nCourtesy of Prime Video\n\nSince we now know that the end is near, you've got Jeffrey Dean Morgan coming in for this perfect pairing with Karl Urban. Those two could be literally from the same DNA pool. You've had Jensen, Jared [Padalecki] is now available. People are going to ask, is the idea of Season 5 just bring out all of the big guns?\n\nNo, it'll be whatever's right for story. I mean, look, I definitely want to get Jared in there. I feel like that would be one I would love to do. Like I've said, I'm completing my game of Supernatural Pokemon. But the truth is, I just like working with people that I like, and Supernatural just happens to be chockfull of people that have remained dear friends of mine. And if I had to choose between someone I didn't know and a good friend and they're both talented, I'll pick the person I know and love every time. So part of it is just I like working with family.\n\nRelatedThe 25 Best Prime Video Original Series, Ranked\n\nAll right, nice. I've got to wrap you, but last question: I know people are talking about the themes and the topics that you tackle on the season. What was the vibe you wanted for this season?\n\nBecause it's the penultimate season, I wanted it to be the one where you dig deepest into the characters and you really got to understand really what makes them all tick. So then they can launch into the final season and you'll care that much more about them. So this was meant to be -- not that it's a quiet season -- but this is meant to be a more introspective season than the other ones, sort of that end-of-Act Two low point before you take off for the rollercoaster ride of Act Three.\n\nThe Boys, Thursdays, Prime Video\n\nMore Headlines:\n\n'The Boys': Eric Kripke on Ending With Season 5, Jared Padalecki Hopes & Emotional Arcs'Wheel of Fortune': Pat Sajak Gets Ryan Seacrest Ready to Host This Fall in New Promo (VIDEO)Griffin Dunne's Memoir: 5 Shocking Revelations About Dominique Dunne's Tragic Death'Starfleet Academy' Casts Paul Giamatti: Everything We Know About New 'Star Trek' SeriesWhen Is the 'Jeopardy!'

We always want to write the characters as human as we can, even ones as outrageous as Firecracker.\n\nSpeaking of that second episode...can we talk about the Rob Benedict of it all? You're literally putting the \"dick\" in Rob Benedict. How long have you been wanting to have him Human Centipede himself?\n\n[Laughs] Since the day I met him. No. We were playing around with this notion of clone sex and what an ultimate act of masturbation that would be. Then I heard that Rob was interested in going out for the role, so I said, \"We have to stop for a minute. I need to call him. I need to explain exactly what he's getting himself into.\" Because none of that was in the audition pages, obviously. And so I walked him through it and I explained all the butt-eating and all the nudity, and he thought it was hilarious. He was excited. To be clear, that's not really his penis. That's an eight-day fight sequence.\n\nEight days?!\n\nYeah. So that was a prosthetic. He is basically wearing a speedo or a thong perhaps with a prosthetic penis glued to the front, which I don't know if that makes it better or worse...[Laughs]\n\nSince we now know that the end is near, you've got Jeffrey Dean Morgan coming in for this perfect pairing with Karl Urban. Those two could be literally from the same DNA pool. You've had Jensen, Jared [Padalecki] is now available. People are going to ask, is the idea of Season 5 just bring out all of the big guns?\n\nNo, it'll be whatever's right for story. I mean, look, I definitely want to get Jared in there. I feel like that would be one I would love to do. Like I've said, I'm completing my game of Supernatural Pokemon. But the truth is, I just like working with people that I like, and Supernatural just happens to be chockfull of people that have remained dear friends of mine. And if I had to choose between someone I didn't know and a good friend and they're both talented, I'll pick the person I know and love every time. So part of it is just I like working with family.\n\nAll right, nice. I've got to wrap you, but last question: I know people are talking about the themes and the topics that you tackle on the season. What was the vibe you wanted for this season?\n\nBecause it's the penultimate season, I wanted it to be the one where you dig deepest into the characters and you really got to understand really what makes them all tick. So then they can launch into the final season and you'll care that much more about them. So this was meant to be -- not that it's a quiet season -- but this is meant to be a more introspective season than the other ones, sort of that end-of-Act Two low point before you take off for the rollercoaster ride of Act Three.", "source": {"uri": "tvinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damian_holbrook@tvinsider.com", "name": "Damian Holbrook", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomer_Capone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomer Capone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessie_T._Usher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessie T.

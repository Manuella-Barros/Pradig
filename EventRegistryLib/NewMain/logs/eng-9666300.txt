Among them are draft treaties dated March 17 and April 15, 2022.\n\nThey are complemented by interviews with \"more than a dozen Ukrainian, Russian, and Western current and former officials and others close to the talks\". Among them are three members of Ukraine's negotiating team.\n\nOne Ukrainian negotiator, Oleksandr Chalyi, said, \"We managed to find a very real compromise. We were very close in the middle of April, in the end of April, to finalize our war with some peaceful settlement.\"\n\nSo why was there no conclusion to stop Russia's invasion, then two months old, and its war crimes?\n\nThe talks began in Belarus on February 28, 2022, only four days after the Russia had launched their unsuccessful attempt for Kyiv's quick capitulation and the fall of the Zelenskiy Government.\n\nThe Russian negotiators seemed to have little sense of that immediate failure. When the Ukrainians noted that Moscow already had 3,000 troops killed in action, Vladimir Putin's lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky was surprised. Russia's senior military official Aleksandr Fomin insisted, \"No, we only have 80 soldiers [killed].\"\n\nUkraine conceded that it would be a \"permanently neutral state\" never joining NATO or allowing foreign forces to be based on its soil. But the Russians wanted more.\n\nIn the March 17 draft, Moscow demanded that Ukraine give up all of the Donbas -- the Donetsk and Luhansk regions -- in the east of the country. Kyiv had to recognize that Crimea, seized by Putin in 2014, was legally part of Russia. There would be strict limits on the size of the Ukrainian armed forces, including the number of tanks, artillery batteries, warships, and combat aircraft. Ukraine's national identity would be eroded through measures such as a ban on naming places after Ukrainian independence fighters.\n\nA week later, Poland's President Andrzej Duda held up the text to NATO leaders in Brussels and asked, \"Which of you would sign it?\" Not a single hand was raised.\n\nBy the start of April, Russia had been defeated throughout northern Ukraine. Its troops were forced to withdraw, leaving behind slain civilians in mass killings such as in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.\n\nEven with the revelation of the war crimes, the Ukrainians continued the talks, now being held in Istanbul, Turkey. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, visiting Bucha on April 4, confirmed the pngoing discussions.\n\nWith each setback, Putin \"reduced his demands\", said one of the Ukrainian negotiators. Russia shifted focus from territorial demands to Ukraine's proposal of neutrality and security guarantees.\n\nIn the two-page Istanbul Communiqu\u00e9, Kyiv proposed that the status of Crimea would decided over 10 to 15 years, with a pledge not to try to retake the peninsula by force. Zelensky and Putin would meet in person to complete a peace treaty, including how much Ukrainian territory Russia would continue to occupy.\n\nUkraine also wanted the assurance of possible guarantor states such as the UK, China, Russia, the US, France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Italy, Poland, and Israel.\n\nThe Guarantor States and Ukraine agree that in the event of aggression, any armed attack on Ukraine or any military operation against Ukraine, each of the Guarantor States, after urgent and immediate consultations between them...will provide ... assistance to Ukraine, as a permanently neutral state under attack.\n\nOn April 15, the Russian negotiators sent a 17-page draft treaty to Putin.\n\nAnd there the proposed agreement unraveled. Three days earlier, Putin indicated that he would make renewed demands. He promised that Russia would achieve all of its \"noble\" aims in Ukraine through military action. As for the talks, \"we have again returned to a dead-end situation for us\".\n\nNow the Russians demanded that the firing range of Ukraine's missiles be limited to 25 miles, rather than Kyiv's 174 miles. The army would have no more than 85,000 personnel, rather than 250,000, and 342 tanks rather than 800. They insisted that Ukraine repeal laws related to language and national identity, and pull back its troops as part of a cease-fire.\n\nMost importantly, Putin's officials inserted a clause saying that all guarantor states -- including Russia -- had to approve any response if Ukraine were attacked. Moscow could invade Ukraine and then veto any military intervention to defend against the aggression.\n\nUkraine's lead negotiator David Arakhamia noted that Kyiv could not give way to the ultimatum: \"There is no, and there was no, trust in the Russians that they would do it. That could only be done if there were security guarantees.\"\n\nSigning an agreement without effective guarantees would have left Ukraine vulnerable to a second incursion, he added: \"They would have come in more prepared, because they came in, in fact, unprepared for such resistance.\"\n\nThe Ukrainians saw no way forward. One said, \"We had no interest in continuing the talks.\"\n\nOn May 2, Oleksii Danilov, the chair of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, closed the door for good: \"A treaty with Russia is impossible -- only capitulation can be accepted.\"", "source": {"uri": "eaworldview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EA WorldView"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_lucas@eaworldview.com",

The peace sought by Ukraine's president, Volodymir Zelenski, is nothing like the peace sought by Vladimir Putin, the aggressor who has been waging an invasive war since 24 February 2022.\n\nNor is there really much desire on either side to sit down and negotiate, and it may be a miscalculation for a Zelenski who has shown his bravery to the world. He did not flee with his family as the Kremlin believed.\n\nThe last diplomatic meeting, at the B\u00fcrgenstock resort in Switzerland, was attended by 80 leaders, including leaders and delegations from various parts of the world, who gathered for the so-called Summit for Peace in Ukraine on 15 and 16 June.\n\nZelenski, who gained fame in his country as a successful television comedian, without any political experience, but catapulted by his enormous popularity, won the elections against Petro Poroshenko with 73.22% of the votes and has been president of Ukraine since 20 May 2019. He never imagined that in less than three years he would be fighting the most important battle of his life, in an arm wrestling match against Putin himself.\n\nIf there is one thing he has shown in all these months, it is his leadership skills. Zelenski has become a respected leader who speaks in the parliaments of several countries, who is present at most international summits and who has won the backing of fractious Western countries and even the unimaginable: attacking Russia with weapons provided by the United States, for example, with its Himars missiles; and with other weapons from other NATO member countries.\n\nThe big question is whether the Ukrainian leader, who has achieved almost everything he has set out to achieve, from more military funding, economic aid, arms, ammunition, military intelligence and direct access to world leaders, will get his way and end up either expelling the invader or imposing his so-called Ten-Point Plan for Peace on it.\n\nIt is the same document he has repeatedly unveiled since July 2022 when Turkey offered to mediate between the two countries and broker a deal to export Ukrainian grain from ports controlled by Russian soldiers.\n\nZelenski speaks of a just peace for Ukrainians and in his formula the following conditions are necessary: 1) that Ukraine controls radiological and nuclear safety throughout its territory and that Russian soldiers leave the Zaporiyia nuclear power plant; 2) that Ukraine controls the security of all ports and waters belonging to it in the Black Sea to facilitate the transit of its trade and thus ensure its food security; for this he demands the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the ports and the withdrawal of all military components in the Black Sea; 3) that Ukraine controls everything related to energy supply and for this it demands that Russian soldiers leave those companies related to electricity, oil, gas or nuclear production that are in Ukraine; 4) the exchange and release of prisoners; 5) respect for the UN Charter on territorial integrity, Ukraine reiterates that it will not allow a partitioned Ukraine; 6) the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from all territory, including Crimea, as well as the cessation of hostilities; 7) that Russia be investigated for war crimes; 8) the implementation of a series of programmes against ecocide and the protection of the environment in the face of the devastation of thousands of hectares of bombed crops; 9) the signing of an agreement with several countries as witnesses and guarantors so that Russia commits itself not to invade Ukraine again; and 10) the signing of an armistice between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader repeatedly cites the UN Charter and international law as the basis for peace negotiations with the Kremlin.\n\nHowever, Putin has other plans for his idea of a ceasefire and peace. Among his best-known demands are two: 1) that Kiev hand over to Russia all four of Putin's claimed regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporiyia and Kherson. And, in addition, it will continue to control Crimea as it has since 2014; and, 2) that Ukraine signs that it will never join NATO or install NATO bases on its territory.\n\nNo Russian delegation was invited to the Ukrainian peace conclave in B\u00fcrgenstock, a fact that Putin took advantage of to launch his demands from Russia, in which he spoke to the Russian press of an \"end to peace\" that would include Ukraine's commitment to remain a neutral and completely demilitarised territory.\n\nHe did not forget that among the Kremlin's demands is that the West lift all economic, financial and diplomatic sanctions imposed against Russia, members of the Russian government, the Duma and Russian businessmen close to Putin.\n\nAt this point, peace is unlikely at this stage. The demands remain the same as they were two years ago, albeit with more military deaths on both sides and of course civilians, while the destruction to Ukrainian infrastructure remains devastating: the reconstruction bill is estimated at around 450 billion euros, according to the World Bank.\n\nWar is a diabolical game where everyone wants to win and no one wants to lose, where thinking is clouded and dead soldiers are just numbers and civilian suffering is just another anecdote. Every day the war costs Ukraine 200 million euros a day and for its economic survival alone the Ukrainian government needs 15 billion euros by 2024.\n\nUkraine has fallen into the Thucydides Trap and is paying a very high cost for it. The dilemma it faces is either to prolong the war and hold out until Zelensky is killed and the surrender happens on Russian terms with the imposition of a puppet government, or to negotiate a peace on Russian terms and cede to Putin one fifth of its territory full of shipyards, with the powerful Zaporiyia nuclear power plant, an outlet to the Black Sea, refineries and a sizeable steel network, as well as important granaries. In this way it could retain a sovereign and democratic part of the territory, and possibly within the EU.\n\nIn either case, Ukraine's future lies with the Russian government. What does seem unlikely (but not impossible) is that it will be Russia that ends up defeated in its war aggression.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"},

Over 90 countries and 50 heads of state, including India, Turkey, and Hungary, attended. Russia was not invited, and China chose not to attend. In response to the G-7 Summit and the Peace Conference, Russia employed a dual strategy: a high-intensity military drill showcasing nuclear capabilities and a proposal for negotiations with Ukraine.\n\nDuring the G-7 meeting in Italy (June 13-15), two significant decisions were made: providing $50 billion in loans to Kyiv, backed by $322 billion of frozen Russian central bank assets, and permitting Ukraine to use Western weapons to attack inside Russia, aiming to support Ukraine and intensify pressure on Russia.\n\nAt the end of the two-day diplomatic summit in Switzerland (June 16), the final communique called for the exchange of captured soldiers and the return of deported Ukrainian children, emphasizing dialogue. However, Saudi Arabia, India, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, Mexico, and the UAE did not agree, and Moscow dismissed the summit as \"absurd\" and pointless.\n\nTo safeguard its long-term interests, Pakistan should reduce its dependency on Russia and Ukraine.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin responded to both the G-7 and Peace Summit with his strategic actions. On June 12, 2024, he ordered drills for the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons from the northern Leningrad military district, which borders NATO members Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, covering almost all of Russia's European border from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea. The drills included training with operational-tactical missile systems, sea-based cruise missiles, and Belarusian troops to demonstrate Russia's readiness and signal severe consequences for continued Western support of Ukraine.\n\nThe drills included special training ammunition for operational-tactical missile systems and sea-based cruise missiles with mock warheads, involving Belarusian troops in tactical nuclear weapons exercises. Russia, with about 1,558 non-strategic nuclear warheads, each around 70-75 kilotons-five times the size of the Hiroshima bomb-aimed to signal the severe consequences of Western support for Ukraine.\n\nOn June 13, 2024, amidst the G-7 and Peace Summit, President Putin proposed a six-point peace plan aimed at de-escalation and long-term stability. He promised to order an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine and begin peace negotiations if Kyiv and its Western allies agree to a series of conditions. These include Ukraine withdrawing all of its troops from the four Russian-occupied territories of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhya; the West lifting all sanctions imposed on Moscow; and Kyiv dropping its NATO membership bid.\n\nAccording to this plan, an immediate ceasefire agreement would halt hostilities, creating a conducive environment for peace talks. Second, a gradual withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied territories would reduce military confrontation, though it requires significant trust and verification. Third, deploying international peacekeeping forces would oversee the ceasefire and troop withdrawals, adding accountability but necessitating cooperation and impartiality.\n\nThe plan also calls for comprehensive political dialogue involving Ukraine, Russia, NATO, and the G-7 to address underlying issues, demanding substantial diplomatic efforts. An international fund for reconstructing war-torn areas in Ukraine would support economic recovery, fostering stability but needing careful management.\n\nFinally, ensuring Ukraine's neutral status addresses Russia's security concerns while providing security guarantees for Ukraine, although this may face resistance from Ukrainian nationalists and Western allies.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies reacted with scepticism and criticism towards the Russian President's peace proposal. Ukrainian officials dismissed the plan as hypocritical, pointing out ongoing Russian military actions in Ukraine and accusing Russia of using diplomacy as a guise while continuing aggressive operations. Western allies echoed these sentiments, expressing doubts about Russia's sincerity in seeking peace and emphasizing the need for Russia to demonstrate genuine commitment by ceasing hostilities and withdrawing troops from occupied territories. The proposal was seen as insufficient and lacking credibility given the current circumstances.\n\nUkraine and its Western allies aim to end the war by ensuring a complete withdrawal of Russian troops and the restoration of Ukraine's 1991 borders. They seek accountability for war crimes through international mechanisms and require robust security guarantees to prevent future aggression. Western allies support this plan with continuous military aid, intensified economic sanctions on Russia, diplomatic pressure for global isolation of Russia, and substantial financial aid for Ukraine's post-war reconstruction and economic recovery. This comprehensive strategy aims to secure Ukraine's sovereignty and establish durable peace.\n\nPredictions for the Russia-Ukraine war, given the current dynamics, include a prolonged stalemate with significant humanitarian and economic costs, potential escalation with more severe tactics from Russia and intensified countermeasures from Ukraine and its allies, or a negotiated settlement despite mutual distrust and differing peace conditions. There's also a risk of the conflict internationalizing, drawing in more direct involvement from NATO and other countries, which could escalate into a broader regional or global conflict. The situation remains fluid, influenced by ongoing diplomatic, military, and economic actions.\n\nIf the war prolongs this would adversely impact the entire globe and the weak economies like Pakistan in particular. Pakistan depends on Ukraine for significant agricultural imports like wheat and sunflower oil and has acquired military hardware from Ukraine, including tanks and aircraft engines. From Russia, Pakistan is exploring natural gas imports, and potential crude oil deals, and relies on Russian raw materials such as metals and fertilizers, along with investment in energy and infrastructure projects. To navigate the geopolitical tensions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Pakistan must maintain balanced diplomatic relations to ensure continued access to these critical imports and technologies.\n\nTo safeguard its long-term interests, Pakistan should reduce its dependency on Russia and Ukraine. It should diversify its suppliers of grain and edible oils by sourcing from countries like Canada, Australia, and Argentina while enhancing domestic agricultural production. In defence, Pakistan can establish procurement agreements with China, Turkey, and European nations and invest in local manufacturing capabilities. For energy supplies, accelerating renewable energy projects and exploring imports from the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa are crucial. Broadening trade networks for raw materials and boosting local industrial production will also enhance resilience and stability amidst prolonged geopolitical conflicts.", "source": {"uri":

The presentation of this rival peace plan was an obvious attempt to undermine Ukraine's Swiss initiative, but it also served as a timely reminder that Putin is waging an old-fashioned war of imperial conquest, and will continue to escalate his demands until he is defeated.\n\nPutin's vision for peace in Ukraine generated little enthusiasm and widespread criticism, with Kyiv officials and world leaders rejecting it as an \"ultimatum.\" Crucially, the terms outlined by Putin would leave around twenty percent of Ukraine under Russian control, including significant portions of the country that Putin's army has so far been unable to capture.\n\nThis new peace proposal is the latest example of the growing territorial demands that have accompanied Russia's ten-year invasion of Ukraine. Time after time over the past decade, Putin has rejected accusations of an expansionist agenda, only to then escalate his invasion of Ukraine further.\n\nWhen Russia first attacked Ukraine in February 2014, Putin insisted Moscow had no territorial ambitions beyond the seizure of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. \"We do not want to divide Ukraine,\" he assured the watching world. Within weeks, however, Kremlin forces posing as locals had sparked a separatist war in eastern Ukraine's Donbas region.\n\nFor the following eight years, Putin steadily strengthened his grip on the so-called \"separatist republics\" of eastern Ukraine, while consistently denying any direct involvement. The failure of the international community to hold Putin accountable for this shameless duplicity fuelled a sense of impunity in Moscow that set the stage for the largest European invasion since World War II.\n\nIn his February 2022 address announcing the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Putin once again denied harboring any ambitions to annex additional Ukrainian lands. \"It is not our plan to occupy Ukrainian territory,\" he stated. \"We do not intend to impose anything on anyone by force.\" Just six months later, Putin demonstrated the true value of his word by solemnly announcing the annexation of four more Ukrainian provinces.\n\nSignificantly, the invading Russian army did not fully control any of the Ukrainian provinces claimed by Putin in September 2022. This created a degree of ambiguity regarding the exact geographical extent of Russia's goals, with Kremlin officials typically limiting themselves to vague calls for Ukraine to recognize the \"new territorial realities\" created by the front lines of the invasion.\n\nPutin's new peace plan has now removed all doubt. Indeed, he took special care to clarify that he expects the Ukrainian military to withdraw completely from the four Ukrainian provinces in question, including unoccupied areas. Among other things, this would mean handing over the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, with a prewar population of more than seven hundred thousand, along with Kherson, which was the only Ukrainian regional capital captured by the Russians before being liberated in November 2022.\n\nUkraine would also have to voluntarily demilitarize, accept geopolitical neutrality, and submit to \"denazification,\" Kremlin code for the suppression of Ukrainian national identity and the imposition of a Russian imperial ideology. In other words, Putin is insisting Ukraine admit defeat and surrender.\n\nThe terms offered by Putin confirm that he has no intention of reaching a sustainable peace with Ukraine. On the contrary, the Russian dictator evidently remains as committed as ever to his overriding war aim of extinguishing Ukrainian statehood and erasing the Ukrainian nation. As if to underline the point, Putin accompanied his latest demands with a warning that \"the existence of Ukraine\" depends on Kyiv's readiness to accept his conditions.\n\nIn fact, there is even more at stake than the existence of Ukraine. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of global security is currently being determined on the battlefields of Ukraine. If Putin's invasion succeeds, it will signal the dawning of a new era marked by rising international insecurity, ballooning defense budgets, and increasingly frequent wars of aggression.\n\nA victorious Russia would almost certainly remain at the forefront of this descent into lawlessness for many years to come. Throughout the past decade, Putin has steadily escalated his invasion of Ukraine while shifting his entire country onto a war footing. By this point, it should be painfully clear to all objective observers that he will not stop until he is stopped. Indeed, Putin has openly compared today's war to the eighteenth century imperial conquests of Peter the Great, and frequently speaks in terms of a sacred mission to \"return historically Russian lands.\"\n\nAs anyone with a passing knowledge of Russian history will confirm, there are at least fifteen other countries beyond Ukraine that were once part of the Russian Empire and therefore meet Putin's definition of \"historically Russian.\" All are now potential targets. While it is impossible to know exactly what Putin will do next if he defeats Ukraine, the idea that he will simply choose to stop is perhaps the most far-fetched scenario of all.\n\nNor will Putin be the only authoritarian ruler looking to embrace a new age of imperial aggression. China, Iran, and North Korea are all already providing the Russian war effort with varying degrees of support, and make no secret of their eagerness to overturn the existing world order. If Moscow achieves an historic victory in Ukraine, Beijing, Tehran, and Pyongyang will also be emboldened, along with a whole host of fellow autocrats throughout the Global South.\n\nThe only way to avoid a geopolitical future shaped by insecurity and imperialism is by ensuring Russia loses in Ukraine. Putin's recent bogus peace proposal is essentially a call for Kyiv's capitulation and the absorption of Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. This is entirely in line with the policies of escalation he has pursued throughout the past decade, and reflects an imperial agenda that leaves no room for meaningful compromise.\n\nThe Russian dictator still clearly believes he can overwhelm Ukraine with brute force while intimidating the wider Western world into inaction. If he succeeds, the consequences for international security will be devastating. Ukraine's leaders have already responded to Putin's latest demands with characteristic defiance. Kyiv's international partners must now go further and provide the military support to secure Ukrainian victory.\n\nPeter Dickinson is editor of the Atlantic Council's UkraineAlert service.\n\nThe views expressed in UkraineAlert are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Atlantic Council, its staff, or its supporters.\n\nImage: Russia's President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during a meeting with the leadership of the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow, Russia June 14, 2024.

Petro: Ukraine's draft woes leave the West facing pressure to make up for the troop shortfall - Russia News Now", "body": "Ukraine's current military recruitment campaign is not going according to plan.\n\nAnnounced on April 16, 2024, the drive was aimed at enlisting hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainian men to help push back against a Russian invasion that has gained momentum in recent months.\n\nBut the effort has been met with public skepticism, draft dodging and opposition to unpopular, heavy-handed attempts to root out those not heeding the call to sign up. It has left Ukraine struggling to fill the positions officials say are needed to beat back the invading army.\n\nRather than solving Ukraine's problems, the draft effort is multiplying them. And that puts pressure on the West's current strategy to support Ukraine primarily through military aid. Moreover, I believe it risks the prospect of troops from NATO countries eventually being pulled into direct military confrontation with Russia.\n\nAfter Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, there was a wave of enthusiasm among Ukrainians for signing up to defend their country. But after Ukraine's unsuccessful counteroffensive of 2023, recruiting for the war has become much more difficult.\n\nAt the end of March 2024, a nationwide poll asked Ukrainians how they thought their draft-age acquaintances might respond to a call to serve. Only 10% thought they would accept. Another nationwide poll taken at the time found only 8% willing to \"take up arms\" against the Russian invaders.\n\nNo one disputes Ukraine's desperate need for more troops. In December 2023, when he was still commander in chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi told president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he needed 450,000 to 500,000 more troops.\n\nHe also pointed out that the additional US$61 billion the United States was proposing to fund the war for another year was far too small. To transform this struggle into one that Ukraine could win, he said, would require more than five times that amount. He was dismissed soon thereafter.\n\nZaluzhnyi may well be right on both counts, but Ukraine's most urgent problem right now is that it does not have enough troops.\n\nA law approved in April - after being delayed for nearly a year - seeks to change this. It lowers the minimum draft age from 27 to 25, requires that all men aged 18 to 25 complete basic military service, and mandates that all military-age men currently abroad return to Ukraine to register.\n\nIn theory, this takes the total number of Ukrainian men eligible for mobilization to 3.7 million.\n\nThe number that actually enlist, however, is likely to be only a small fraction of this. One reason is demography: Fewer than 420,000 males born in Ukraine are today in the 25-27 age category.\n\nAnd a significant portion of these may already be among the 800,000 Ukrainian men who have either left the country, are already serving in the military, are exempt or are deemed unfit for military service.\n\nThose who have already left are the most unlikely to heed the call. While nearly a million people inside Ukraine have already renewed their military status online, only 11,000 - or 1.5% - of those living abroad have done so.\n\nDespite optimism among Ukrainian politicians about sending as many as 20,000 convicts to the front lines - those who have committed no more than one murder, rape or other serious crime - the bottom line, according to analysts in the Ukrainian military's general staff, is that, all told, these new recruitment efforts are likely to add no more than 100,000 new troops.\n\nBy contrast, Russia has a population pool far larger than Ukraine's, with four times the number of active military personnel and a quarter-million reservists.\n\nIt is also adding 30,000 new contract recruits every month. As one Ukrainian military expert cited by French newspaper Le Monde put it, even if the number of new Ukrainian recruits were twice what is expected, \"it is not enough.\"\n\nAdding even these soldiers, however, comes with growing resentment over efforts to browbeat would-be recruits into compliance.\n\nThose who do not comply with the demands of Ukraine's Territorial Recruitment Centers can have their driver's licenses suspended, as well as their credit cards and bank accounts frozen. Ukrainians residing abroad will be denied consular services, including passport renewal, if they fail to comply with registration demands within 60 days.\n\nMeanwhile, the hunt for eligible men has seen recruitment officers hauling people in from off the street and from popular nightclubs and fitness centers. They have been backed up by police checking military IDs on routine traffic stops. Employers and even university faculty must gather and submit names of employees and students for registration.\n\nRegistered draft-age Ukrainian men must be able at all times to display their military registration information or face fines of up to two to three times the minimum monthly salary. As the Ukrainian media has pointed out, these penalties provide ample opportunity for bribery at each stage of the process.\n\nSince the new draft law has come into force, public outrage has slowly grown to the point that, as Ukrainian political analyst Kost Bondarenko puts it, \"the Territorial Recruitment Centers will be the main component of Ukraine's defeat, if, God forbid, it should happen.\"\n\nProblems with the Ukrainian draft are underscoring a fact that many in the West have struggled to accept: That without massive new injections of foreign cash, weapons and troops, Ukraine is going to exhaust its resources long before Russia does.\n\nWhile some Western analysts have been making this point for years, many politicians in the West have studiously ignored it. Now, an increasing number of them are coming to the conclusion that there is no other choice but to send in NATO troops to stave off Ukraine's defeat.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden has vowed repeatedly not to send U.S. troops to Ukraine, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown, Jr., has said that he considers some type of U.S. troop presence in Ukraine \"inevitable.\"\n\nMeanwhile, more than one NATO country has suggested military deployment with or without the alliance's blessing.\n\nThe situation on the battlefield, meanwhile, may have already deteriorated to the point that, even if NATO were to send in as many troops as Ukraine hopes to raise in the draft, it might still not be enough to turn the tide.\n\nWestern politicians have warned that if Russia wins, the consequences would be catastrophic. This seemingly leaves no option but to support Ukraine for \"as long as it takes\" or \"whatever the cost.\"\n\nBut if that means NATO troop involvement, it risks drawing the United States into direct confrontation with Russia. Whether the U.S. personnel involved in Ukraine are advisers, technicians, trainers or combat forces makes no difference to Russia - they would be seen in Moscow as legitimate targets.\n\nWhile Ukraine's draft problems present NATO leaders with a conundrum, escalation isn't the only option.\n\nEnding the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy is still a possibility - and Russia recently indicated that an aborted 2022 peace plan could still form the basis for negotiations.\n\nAt the time, Ukraine balked at signing that proposal - which would have seen the country remain neutral and ended its aspirations to join NATO, in exchange for other security guarantees. Today, however, Ukraine has more incentives than ever to negotiate for peace.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It did the opposite. Russia wasn't invited. China didn't send a delegation. Other major countries that might influence the Kremlin - including Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the UAE - refused to sign the watered-down final communiqu\u00e9.\n\nAccording to a former senior member of Zelensky's administration, Ukraine's leader had 'hoped the conference would mark a new benchmark of international support... [but] it just showed how badly we have lost the support in the Global South'. Take Brazil's President, Lula da Silva. He was one of the first world leaders to condemn Russia's invasion, yet in Switzerland he accused Vladimir Putin and Zelensky of 'enjoying the war... otherwise they would have already sat and talked and tried to find a peaceful solution'. Only the US and the EU unequivocally supported Zelensky.\n\nThough the Kremlin likes to claim otherwise, Ukraine's declining support has little to do with Putin's charm offensive. All of Russia's closest neighbours except Belarus have distanced themselves from Moscow. Russia has deepened ties only with Iran and North Korea - Putin visited this week - and with China, which has provided diplomatic support but no military hardware.\n\nRather, for practically every country and global bloc, economic and strategic self-interest has trumped principles. The EU has taken the lead on sanctions, but hasn't banned Russian oil, merely capping the price at $60 a barrel rather than $73 for Urals crude. Europe never sanctioned Russian gas. It continues to import 15 per cent of its natural gas, of which 8 per cent is piped from Russia via Ukraine and Slovakia. Gazprom paid transit fees of $850 million to Ukraine last year, around 0.46 per cent of Kyiv's GDP, making the Kremlin one of the largest taxpayers in Ukraine. Just 8 per cent of EU firms have fully divested from Russia.\n\nSenior US diplomats continue to forbid Ukraine from using long-range weaponry inside Russia (missile launch sites excepted). Kyiv was recently told to stop attacking Russian oil refinery capacity for fear of causing an oil crisis. Donald Trump, meanwhile, recently said he'd veto more aid to Ukraine. 'Zelensky is probably the greatest salesman of all living politicians,' he declared. 'Whenever he comes to our country, he leaves it with $60 billion... And then he comes back and says he needs another $60 billion.'\n\nThe Global South wants to continue importing Ukrainian grain and cheap Russian oil. India's economy has been boosted by a large increase in imports of Russian crude, much of which is re-exported back to Europe as refined petrol. Turkey imports Russian gas and re-exports it to southern Europe, and maintains large agriculture and consumer trade. The UAE has become a hub for sanctions-busting Russian banking. China has seen its trade with Russia nearly double to more than $200 billion a year. Beijing benefits from a weak Russia - they've little incentive to end the war.\n\nPutin recently demanded that Ukraine cede even more territory to stop the invasion. His proposal is delusional. But Zelensky's plan to push for a total victory isn't much more realistic. He recently told a fellow European leader he intends to continue until Russia withdraws from all of Ukraine's territory, pays reparations and is punished for war crimes. 'If we don't make progress this year, then we will try again next year, and the one after that,' Zelensky reportedly said.\n\nThe Ukrainian President's insistence on fighting until victory is ideologically coherent. Putin's aggression must be seen to fail; the rules-based international order relies on upholding international borders. But in practice, Ukraine will face a terrible winter. Russia's systematic destruction of its electricity infrastructure has closed more than half of its power stations. Berlin expects up to a million Ukrainian refugees as the cold and dark starts to bite, according to a source close to the German government. Ukraine is also running out of manpower. It's relying on press gangs to seize men off the streets to fight.\n\nThat's not to say Russia isn't hurting. With new, medium-range western cruise missiles, Kyiv has turned the Crimean peninsula into a killing zone for Russian aircraft and warships. A recent Russian attack on Kharkiv province was pushed back with major loss of life. The war is consuming 40 per cent of the Kremlin's budget.\n\nBut Russia has four times Ukraine's population and a wartime economy 20 times larger. The West's reluctance to reduce energy exports has effectively allowed Russia to ignore sanctions. Russia's GDP is set to grow more than any G7 nation's this year. Life in Moscow is pretty much normal, thanks to parallel imports through neighbouring countries. Just 0.4 per cent of Muscovite men of military age have served, compared with around 9 per cent in poor regions like Tuva and Buryatia. Putin is fighting with an army of provincial and colonial troops, plus international mercenaries, prisoners and homeless men whom he considers expendable.\n\nNonetheless, Putin's renewed talk of peace is a sign he'd be content to end the war, though not before the US election. For many international diplomats, the path towards a ceasefire is clear. 'It's devastatingly obvious how this war will end,' says one former western senior statesman who travels frequently to Kyiv. 'Ceasefire along the line of control, plus security guarantees for Kyiv short of full Nato membership. No formal ceding of territory. Ukraine becomes like Cyprus - an EU member which does not recognise that it's been partitioned.'\n\nThe world seems to be engaging in 'pre-peace' positioning. The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz predicted recently that the war would end at the 'next' peace summit - and that Russia should be invited. Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, added: 'China could stop Russia's invasion of Ukraine with one phone call.' If Zelensky's summit demonstrated anything, it's that international support for a forever war is waning and the time for ugly compromises is beginning.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType":

Other reports put the number of Russian soldiers at 200.\n\nOn June 13, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he signed 10-year security agreements with Japan and the United States at the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy. The agreement with Japan would give Ukraine $4.5bn in military, humanitarian and financial aid this year alone, he said.\n\nThe value of the defence agreement with the US over the next 10 years was not stated.\n\nThe White House said it would \"support the full range of Ukraine's current defensive needs now and over the long term by helping Ukraine win the war\".\n\nThe US Congress has approved $61bn in military aid for Ukraine this year, and US President Joe Biden, who faces an election in November, has been reportedly trying to lock any future administration into maintaining help for Ukraine. The agreement at the G7 was made by the executive branch, is not a ratified treaty and could be repealed by a future president.\n\nAlthough Ukraine has signed agreements with 15 countries and has roughly another 15 such agreements under negotiation, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was considering making aid to Kyiv compulsory to ensure it remains \"reliable and large scale\".\n\nThe nature of that safeguard would be to protect Ukraine against changes of government and rein in alliance outliers like Hungary, which has refused to provide military aid to Kyiv's forces.\n\nPremier Viktor Orban on May 24 said Hungary was \"working intensively to figure out how to avoid participating in [a NATO-Russia] war while remaining a NATO member\", according to the Russian state news agency Tass. \"Our lawyers and military are currently working on this.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday, which, he said, included \"mutual assistance in the event of aggression\".\n\nPutin, who visited Pyongyang to sign the agreement, said he did \"not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation\" with North Korea.\n\nDuring his visit to Russia in September, Kim had expressed an interest in ballistic missile technology and wanted Russian help launching satellites.\n\nUS national security spokesman John Kirby said Washington was alarmed by closer Russian-North Korean cooperation.\n\nOther forms of assistance to Ukraine were also announced.\n\nThe G7 summit promised to break new ground in aid to Ukraine by providing $50bn this year in the form of a US loan. The loan would be backed by interest earned from $300bn in Russian assets frozen on the territories of Ukraine's allies, mainly the European Union.\n\nLast month, the EU announced it would send Ukraine roughly $3bn a year in interest earned by Russian assets on its soil. It was not immediately clear if this sum would now be folded into the US loan. Russia has warned it would reciprocate any direct seizure of its assets on Western soil.\n\nThe US also announced new sanctions against 300 individuals and entities in Russia and China in a bid to close loopholes around existing measures. The sanctions included Russian banks Sberbank, VTB Bank and Tochka Bank and Russian defence conglomerate Rostec.\n\nMikhail Zvinchuk, founder of a Kremlin-associated channel on the platform Telegram, told the Bosnian new service BanjaLuka.net that sanctions were having an effect on Russia's defence industry and war economy.\n\nUkraine's allies and neutral countries gathered over the past weekend in Burgenstock, Switzerland, in a first international peace conference held for the Ukraine war.\n\nMore than 80 countries agreed that the threat of nuclear weapons use and the weaponisation of food - both of which Russia has been accused - were unacceptable. Russia and China did not attend the talks, but Moscow has previously said it rejects Zelenskyy's peace terms, including a complete Russian withdrawal from occupied territories.\n\nUkraine continued to strike Russian energy facilities during the week, a policy begun in January.\n\nGeolocated footage showed a Russian oil terminal in Azov burning on Monday and Tuesday. Ukraine also struck an oil facility in Chushka.\n\nUkraine was not permitted to use US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) against targets in Russia, other than in the areas immediately north of Kharkiv, where the new incursion was launched on May 10. Biden reaffirmed that policy last week.\n\nThe Kharkiv region sits on the border with Russia, and its capital, also called Kharkiv, is 30km (20 miles) from the border.\n\nUkraine has been using drones of its own manufacture and last week said it had also used its own Neptune missiles on Russian soil to strike the oil facility in Chushka, east of Crimea, last week and in nearby Kavkaz on May 31.\n\nUkraine used Neptune missiles to sink the Russian missile carrier Moskva in April 2022.\n\nUkraine also clarified it had damaged two Sukhoi-57 fighters in a strike more than 500km (311 miles) from the front lines this month, not one as initially reported.\n\nUkraine's strikes have been particularly successful against air defence systems in Crimea, where it has destroyed 15 systems, according to Ukrainian military intelligence - three of them in the past two weeks.\n\nKyril Budanov, the head of intelligence, said Russia had now resorted to stationing an experimental S-500 system there.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_psaropoulos@aljazeera.com", "name": "John T Psaropoulos", "type": "author",

Among other topics, he addressed the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"If negotiations are linked to the withdrawal of our troops, about which the Kiev regime dreams, then this will never happen,\" Putin told reporters.\n\n\"Because the Kiev regime does not want to relinquish power, does not want to hold normal elections according to the Ukrainian constitution, they will forever drag out the ceasefire talks,\" the Russian president added. \"This means that Kiev has an interest in our troops remaining there, because they don't want to hold elections.\"\n\nAs for attempts to \"beat back\" Russian troops from Kharkov, Putin said that Kiev's orders to get a victory on the battlefield \"at all costs\" will once again cost Ukraine dearly. Kharkov, he said, was a tactical operation, which Ukraine is trying to describe as strategic.\n\nWhen asked about the Western rejection of the peace terms he offered Ukraine last week, Putin said that it was true to form.\n\n\"I expected just such a reaction, at first,\" he said. \"What happens later, time will tell.

It's a bloody puzzle: Why have Ukraine and Russia continued fighting for so long, tearing each other to pieces? Why can't they get to a peace deal and end the slaughter?\n\nIn a recent book, I examined why some wars are so difficult to end. I found that a fundamental problem causing wars to endure is belligerents' deep distrust that the adversary will respect a war-ending peace deal. Even when a possible war-ending deal has acceptable terms, if a belligerent thinks that its adversary will break the deal the belligerent won't take it, and the war will grind on.\n\nThis deep lack of trust has fueled many long and bloody wars. In 1940, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill sloughed off Germany's peace feelers, knowing that the Nazis could not be trusted. More recently, the Syrian civil war has dragged on for more than a decade because rebel groups have no faith in the word of the Assad government. The shadow of what might happen after a peace deal is struck affects whether parties will accept a peace deal in the first place.\n\nOf course, there is an ocean of suspicion between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukraine deeply distrusts Russia, as Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea, support for the Donbas insurgency, and 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine violate the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which Russia agreed to respect Ukraine's borders and sovereignty.\n\nWorse, some possible peace terms, such as granting Russia permanent control of the economically valuable and militarily important Donbas region, would shift the balance of power in Russia's favor. Ukraine would be especially unlikely to accept this kind of deal, because it would expand a strengthened Russia's incentives to break the deal down the line. This was one reason why Churchill refused to negotiate, as he feared that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler would demand British colonies and naval disarmament in any peace deal, leaving Britain helpless to resist eventual German demands for total British capitulation.\n\nRussia, judging by its official statements, distrusts Ukraine and the West. It claims that post-Cold War NATO expansion eastward broke a commitment to respect Russia's sphere of interest. \"Thus, an absolutely unacceptable threat to us was steadily being created right on our borders,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin said in May 2022.\n\nSo, what options remain? How can the two sides find a way out, short of Russia grinding Ukraine to pieces, and leaving aside the unrealistic dream of Putin's removal by a pro-peace faction in Russia?\n\nHistory suggests what might and might not work. In conflicts between smaller belligerents, international peacekeepers can help ameliorate mistrust. But given Russia's size and veto power on the United Nations Security Council, peacekeepers won't be part of the solution. Russia cynically ignored monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe when they were sent to eastern Ukraine in the late 2010s.\n\nThe \"Korea option\" may also be politically challenging. Though the United States still deeply distrusted North Korea and China in 1953, Washington agreed to a ceasefire effectively ending the Korean War because South Korean security could still rest on three stout legs: an alliance between the United States and South Korea, the long-term deployment of a substantial number of US troops to the peninsula, and the US nuclear deterrent.\n\nThe Korea option for Ukraine would come with political challenges, at least in the near term. At the upcoming NATO Summit in July, the Alliance will likely outline the terms of a \"bridge\" to Ukraine's accession, expanding on its 2008 soft commitment to eventual Ukrainian membership. But the politics of Ukraine actually joining NATO appear uncertain. NATO membership for the country would require the unanimous consent of allies, and one could envision Turkey, Hungary, or isolationists in the US Senate blocking this move. Indeed, it appears that in the spring of 2022, an obstacle to a possible path to ending the war emerged in part because Washington indicated that it was unwilling to consider Ukraine's condition for a NATO-like security guarantee from the United States.\n\nBut there is a possible way forward. Imagine that, after the war, the West were to agree not to NATO membership but rather to help Ukraine become sufficiently powerful on its own to deter future Russian attacks by providing military aid and training, as well as by helping Ukraine improve its arms industry. A recent RAND report described a variant of this approach as a \"porcupine\" strategy, making Ukraine a sufficiently prickly target that Russia would leave it alone.\n\nThis strategy would maintain the ability of NATO members to stay out of a future Russia-Ukraine war, making it politically palatable for the West. For Ukraine, it would represent a path to long-term security that does not rely on hopes of benign Russian intentions. And, if this promise was coupled with the sizeable carrot of Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory captured after the 2022 invasion, Ukraine could be brought on board.\n\nFor Russia, the principal attraction of this option would be a de facto, if not de jure, promise not to include Ukraine in NATO. Russia might be more likely to believe in an informal no-membership commitment if it received assurances that Turkey and Hungary would veto Ukrainian membership. Such a promise from Hungary is easy to imagine, given its recent efforts to block the European Union from even sending weapons to Ukraine.\n\nThis kind of no-membership concession might help end the war in another way: It would be a fig leaf for Putin. Recent work reveals that Putin understood that the war was a mistake as early as March 2022. Today, he might remain open to finding a way to end the war, especially given that Russia has already suffered perhaps 150,000 military deaths and may run out of tanks and combat vehicles by summer 2025. However, without a fig-leaf concession, Putin risks being turned out of power by disaffected nationalist elites or military officers. Other dictators have sometimes lost power this way, as when Pakistan's strongman leader Yahya Khan was overthrown after his country was vivisected in the 1971 Bangladesh War. Fig leaves can help buy the support of pro-war militaries for peace deals. In 1945, the United States' agreement to leave the emperor alone was critical in helping the Japanese military accept otherwise unconditional surrender.\n\nSome might propose pursuing the porcupine strategy unilaterally, pouring aid into Ukraine without bothering to get Russian assent to a peace deal. However, the past year has shown that even if well-armed, Ukraine will find it difficult to recapture territory through offensive operations. The right kind of peace deal, agreed to by Russia, is the best means for Ukraine to recover important territory.\n\nCritics would argue that this deal has something for everyone to hate: Ukraine gives up on its dream of NATO membership and perhaps de facto accepts the Russian occupation of Crimea, the West agrees to long-term military and economic aid to Ukraine, and Russia withdraws from post-2022 captured Ukrainian territory. But in politics and in business, parties are in the realm of a feasible deal when all of them find that deal to be painful.\n\nSuch a deal is becoming more possible because the war is a bloody stalemate for all sides. As the staggering costs of war continue to rise, all parties will become increasingly willing to strike a politically painful deal to end the war. Further, especially if Donald Trump does not win the November US presidential election and then withdraw US support for Ukraine, it is difficult for either Ukraine or Russia to imagine military victory anytime soon.\n\nTo reach peace, Ukraine and its Western partners must find a way to surmount mistrust. Doing so will not be easy. But to prevent tens if not hundreds of thousands more deaths, they must try.\n\nDan Reiter is the Samuel Candler Dobbs professor of political science at Emory University and author of the award-winning book, How Wars End (Princeton, 2009).\n\nImage: Handout photo shows Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is briefed on the fighting along the frontlines by the 92nd Separate Assault Brigade Brigade Commander Pavlo Fedosenko, May 16, 2024, in the Kharkiv region, Ukraine.

Join us in this fight.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin claimed on June 20 that the West is trying to push Russia toward a strategic defeat on Ukrainian battlefields, which would, according to him, mean the end of the Russian statehood.\n\n\"For Russia, this means the end of its statehood... This means the end of the thousand-year history of the Russian state. I think this is clear to everyone,\" Putin said at a press conference at the end of his state visit to Vietnam.\n\n\"Then the question arises: why should we be afraid? Isn't it better to go to the end?\"\n\nThe Kremlin chief claimed that Moscow is ready for negotiations but said that if Kyiv wants to connect the talks to the Russian withdrawal from Ukraine, \"that will never happen.\"\n\nA full Russian withdrawal is a key point in President Volodymyr Zelensky's peace formula. Several of its points were discussed last week during a global peace summit in Switzerland, where Russia was not invited.\n\nPutin laid out his conditions for a ceasefire in Ukraine ahead of the summit on June 14, namely the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the four Ukrainian regions claimed - but not fully controlled - by the Kremlin.\n\nThe ultimatum was dismissed by Kyiv and its partners. Putin said this reaction was expected and added that Russia's demands may still change depending on the situation on the battlefield.\n\nUkraine and Switzerland said they are considering inviting a Russian representative to a subsequent peace summit to present them with a joint peace plan.

Among other topics, he addressed the Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"If negotiations are linked to the withdrawal of our troops, about which the Kiev regime dreams, then this will never happen,\" Putin told reporters.\n\n\"Because the Kiev regime does not want to relinquish power, does not want to hold normal elections according to the Ukrainian constitution, they will forever drag out the ceasefire talks,\" the Russian president added. \"This means that Kiev has an interest in our troops remaining there, because they don't want to hold elections.\"\n\nAs for attempts to \"beat back\" Russian troops from Kharkov, Putin said that Kiev's orders to get a victory on the battlefield \"at all costs\" will once again cost Ukraine dearly. Kharkov, he said, was a tactical operation, which Ukraine is trying to describe as strategic.\n\nWhen asked about the Western rejection of the peace terms he offered Ukraine last week, Putin said that it was true to form.\n\n\"I expected just such a reaction, at first,\" he said. \"What happens later, time will tell. It all depends on how the situation develops on the ground.\"\n\nRussia has always been willing to negotiate, while Ukraine and its Western backers sabotaged the Minsk process and the Istanbul talks, Putin said, noting that the terms he outlined will not be valid forever.\n\nAccording to the Russian president, Ukraine has to recognize Russian sovereignty over the entire territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, \"as defined by their administrative borders at the time they joined Ukraine [in August 1991].\" Kiev needs to withdraw its military from these regions and inform Moscow in writing that it no longer plans to join NATO before any ceasefire talks can begin, Putin said last Friday.\n\nVladimir Zelensky has denounced the idea as an \"ultimatum,\" insisting that the only way to end the conflict is based on his \"peace formula\" amounting to a Russian surrender.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that Putin's offer was not \"made in good faith,\" and would cost Kiev \"significantly more land,\" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it a \"classic land grab\" and an attempt to influence the peace

While Ukraine's air defences are working overtime, millions of Ukrainians are suffering from regular blackouts. And it is clear that this is part of Putin's plan to end the war in Ukraine with a victory for Russia.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has reported that Russia has destroyed about 50% of Ukraine's electricity generation capacity. 73% of thermal power plants were destroyed, 20 hydropower plants are not operational. Ukraine regularly conducts planned blackouts to balance and repair the grid, but progress during wartime is unlikely as Russian strikes never end.\n\nRussia allocates enormous resources to strike Ukrainian power plants. If missiles costing millions of dollars are shot down en route, Russia immediately sends a new wave. A lot of money is allocated not to destroy Ukrainian military units, logistics routes or some warehouses, but to attack power plants. Russian propagandists present these attacks as part of a great military strategy. These attacks, they say, will stop trains and cause problems for Ukraine's war logistics, but in reality, the idea behind these attacks may be quite different.\n\nAnton Herashchenko, a Ukrainian military analyst and former adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, claims that Russia is simply preparing to play a trump card - in autumn or winter, they will put the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on the table. The Zaporizhzhia NPP is the largest in Europe and is now controlled by Russian forces. Herashchenko believes that Russia will continue to demolish Ukraine's power generation capacity and then offer to transfer the Zaporizhzhia NPP to Ukraine in exchange for accepting Russia's terms in the negotiations. Their conditions, of course, would be freezing or ending the conflict at the current front lines.\n\nAbsolute control of the public narrative is crucial for Russia in this strategy. Their propagandists have a very clear role in this plan - they have to explain that when Ukrainians are burning Russian troops who are attacking on motorcycles and turtle tanks, it is still somehow logical to attack the plants that produce energy for ordinary cities. One Kinzhal missile costs about 10 million dollars, Kh-101 - about 13 million, Kalibr - about a million. Such money is thrown into Ukrainian power plants far from the front lines, when Russian soldiers attack on motorcycles.\n\nUkraine has already lost 50% of its electricity generation capacity. There are still a few months left before the cold season -Russia can and will continue to attack Ukrainian power plants in this time. Thus, the return of the Zaporizhzhia NPP would be a real salvation for Ukraine. But Russia's conditions are simply unacceptable.", "source": {"uri": "technology.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Power outage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Gerashchenko", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anton Gerashchenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_in_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda in Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zaporizhzhia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Ukraine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-55", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kh-55"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/terro-720x540.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666300", "eventUri": "eng-9666300", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

And they want war. They need to hide the facts of Biden's bribery, and the bio-labs. The amount of corruption in this nation is considered to be far worse than any other nation.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recently stated that he would \"immediately\" cease military actions in Ukraine and start peace talks if Ukraine began to pull its troops from the regions annexed by Moscow in 2022 and abandoned its aspirations to join NATO. Ukraine dismissed these terms as \"manipulative\" and \"absurd.\"\n\nBuy All-American!

At the same time, leaders from the Group of Seven major industrial nations were gathering in Italy. Additionally, the U.S. and Ukraine had just ratified a 10-year security pact, which Russian authorities have declared \"null and void.\"\n\nPutin criticized the Swiss conference as a mere distraction, intended to mislead about the origins and solutions of the Ukrainian situation. He expressed his readiness for a \"final resolution\" to the conflict, emphasizing that the Kremlin was prepared to initiate negotiations immediately.\n\nIn his address to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Putin reiterated demands for Ukraine to recognize Crimea as Russian, maintain its non-nuclear status, limit its military capabilities, and safeguard the rights of Russian-speaking citizens. He called for the removal of all Western sanctions against Russia and emphasized the need to restore unity between Russia and Ukraine, and in Europe broadly.\n\nUkraine's response underscored its rejection of Putin's conditions, branding them as a strategy to deceive the global community and disrupt diplomatic efforts. Ukraine insists on Russia's full withdrawal from its territories, including Crimea, accountability for war crimes, and reparations.\n\nSince Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, the conflict has largely concentrated in the south and east of Ukraine. Russian control over the annexed eastern and southern regions remains incomplete.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, critiqued Putin's proposal as repetitive and insincere, asserting it contained no genuine peace initiatives and reflected a continued willingness to pursue the conflict under different pretexts.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also dismissed Putin's demands, stating from NATO headquarters in Brussels that Putin, having initiated the war unjustly, is not in a position to impose terms on Ukraine. Austin reiterated that Putin could end the conflict immediately if he chose to.\n\nPutin's insistence on Kyiv's full withdrawal from the annexed regions underlines his firm stance. Although Russia retracted its forces from some key regional capitals due to Ukrainian resistance, Putin suggested that the troop deployments near Kyiv were intended to coerce Ukraine into negotiations.\n\nDespite Moscow's formal annexation of additional Ukrainian territories following dubious referendums, Putin indicated that these matters were conclusively settled and not open for further discussion, although he claimed openness to peaceful resolutions in other respects.\n\nWhat may very well come next, is a defense pact between China and Russia. What else can go wrong with Biden in office? Well, these two nations already organized the coming doom of the dollar as the world's currency. This will put an economic dagger into the U.S. Biden and the Democrats, along with the Deep State, did it all...\n\nMajor Points\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin proposed an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine contingent on Kyiv withdrawing troops from annexed regions and dropping NATO membership plans. Ukraine dismissed Putin's proposal as manipulative and absurd, emphasizing it as a ploy to mislead and undermine diplomatic peace efforts. The proposal coincided with a major security agreement between the U.S. and Ukraine and discussions among G7 leaders and a peace conference in Switzerland, which excluded Moscow. Putin's demands included Ukraine recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, maintaining non-nuclear status, and lifting all Western sanctions against Russia. The ongoing conflict has centered mainly in Ukraine's south and east, with significant resistance from Ukrainian forces despite Russia's annexation claims.\n\nAl Santana - Reprinted with permission of

The war shows no signs of ending, and Russia, which wasn't invited, trolled the summit by proposing its own terms for a ceasefire (not even a permanent peace agreement) that would require Kyiv to hand Moscow land the Russian army hasn't been able to conquer in battle.\n\nThe Summit was an exercise in defining what would count as a legitimate outcome from the war, and its limited success betrays divisions in the international community and the West's unwillingness to accept that, if Ukraine is to win and the principle that international borders should not be changed by force is to be upheld, Russia has to lose.\n\nInternational divisions began with another country that wasn't there (China) but continued in the room itself. Kenya argued that using the interest on frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine was theft, while Saudi Arabia, nominally still a Western ally, suggested the aggressor and victim would have to reach a compromise.\n\nOf the ten points in Ukraine's Peace Formula, only three of the lowest common denominator featured on the summit's agenda: the security of nuclear power plants, guarantees for the transport of food across the Black Sea, and the exchange of prisoners. Fundamental issues, like holding Russia to account for its aggression, were dropped for lack of consensus.\n\nThere was better news from South America. Both far-left Gabriel Boric (Chile), and libertarian Javier Milei (Argentina) spoke up in favour of Ukraine, showing Russia's attempt to speak for the \"Global South\" to be as empty as the USSR's efforts to coopt the \"Third World.\"\n\nYet this is very clearly a Northern Hemisphere war. Apart from strong statements in support of Ukraine by the United States and Japan, the most powerful interventions were European. The major European powers expressed their strong support (albeit Italy unnecessarily thought to reiterate that we were not at war with Russia).\n\nAlexander Stubb of Finland spoke of how his grandfather's homeland had been stolen by Stalin's Russia; Estonia's Kaja Kallas went further: the Soviets deported her own mother to Siberia. The most poignant intervention came from president Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia, where upcoming elections in October may well be the last chance to prevent another Russian takeover.\n\nPeace talks seldom shape the balance of power - they reflect it. In this war, where technology favours static defence, advances are to be made by attacking the enemy's ability to supply their forces with ammunition and equipment. Outgunned troops retreat, as Russians did in 2022 in Kharkhiv, and as Ukrainians were forced to, though less dramatically, this spring.\n\nBut as Ukrainians found out last summer, a decisive blow will be hard to land. This will be a war of attrition until enough pressure can be brought upon one side and it is forced to collapse.\n\nFor Kyiv, this means being able to attack Russian supply, weapons manufacturing, and oil refining capacity. For Russia it means being able to deprive Ukraine of the electricity it needs for its arms industry (forcing it to divert limited supplies to keep the civilian population warm in winter), and of Western support.\n\nThe lesson for Western backers of Ukraine should be clear.\n\nLift restrictions on Ukrainian targeting of Russian bases, including glide bomb bases and supply infrastructure, with long-range Western weapons. Keep air defence ammunition flowing. Upgrade military industrial capacity to cope supporting Ukraine through a long war. Intensify economic pressure on Russia - the secondary sanctions announced on 14 June hit the rouble hard, stoking inflation.", "source": {"uri": "conservativehome.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Vietnam's capital Hanoi that was live-streamed on the Kremlin website, Putin said he expected that the West would oppose his peace initiative on Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian president questioned why Russia's proposal was called \"unrealistic\" while no one criticized the same way Ukraine's \"ultimatum,\" containing conditions unacceptable to Moscow.\n\nSane politicians will think about Russia's proposal on Ukraine if they want to end the conflict, he said, warning that conditions may change depending on the situation on the battlefield.\n\nAt the same time, if Kyiv links the start of peace negotiations with the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, then talks will never happen, he stressed.\n\nAbout the legitimacy of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Putin said that he expects him to be replaced by the West in the first half of 2025.\n\nCommenting on NATO's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg's remarks about putting the alliance's nuclear forces on alert, Putin said Russia is closely monitoring such intentions and will respond adequately if something happens.\n\nThe Russian president also noted that the country's authorities are thinking about changes to the nuclear doctrine because \"opponents\" lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAsked if Moscow plans to include a preemptive nuclear strike in the new edition of the doctrine, the president said \"no need,\" explaining that Russian forces are capable of repelling the opponent's attack \"in counter strike.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It all depends on how the situation develops on the ground.\"\n\nRussia has always been willing to negotiate, while Ukraine and its Western backers sabotaged the Minsk process and the Istanbul talks, Putin said, noting that the terms he outlined will not be valid forever.\n\nAccording to the Russian president, Ukraine has to recognize Russian sovereignty over the entire territory of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics, as well as Kherson and Zaporozhye Regions, \"as defined by their administrative borders at the time they joined Ukraine [in August 1991].\" Kiev needs to withdraw its military from these regions and inform Moscow in writing that it no longer plans to join NATO before any ceasefire talks can begin, Putin said last Friday.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporizhzhia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zaporizhzhia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Donetsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kherson", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kherson"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kherson"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luhansk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luhansk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minsk"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.06/article/6674690f20302730cc703a1d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666300", "eventUri": "eng-9666300", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1991-08-", "textStart": 1895, "textEnd": 1906}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Two and a half years later, this view is challenged by a more consequential reality.\n\nThe Russian leader's goal is not just to break Ukraine and stop its quest for a place in the family of Western democracies, but to dismantle the American-led security system that emerged after the second world war. In that sense Mr Putin is fomenting a revolution: using the strategy and tactics of revolution against the Western system. His war against Ukraine is inextricably linked to the strategic objective of his revolution.\n\nIn the early 1990s Russia's reformers judged that the country could be competitive only by integrating itself into the global economy and stepping away from confrontation with the West. The past 20 years of Mr Putin's rule have been characterised by two very different, concurrent patterns: the stage-by-stage dismantling of democracy and freedoms inside Russia, and an intensifying campaign to delegitimise the West, its democratic values and the institutions that uphold them.\n\nInside Russia the results have been greater repression against the Russian people, greater power for the security services, greater wealth for Kremlin-connected business leaders and greater investment in the armed forces. Outside Russia Mr Putin has increasingly pressured the America-led global order; sought to undermine norms, principles, and rules of Western institutions; organised regional and global opposition to the West; and conducted military action in Georgia, Ukraine and Syria.\n\nMr Putin now asserts that the Western system poses an existential threat to the sovereignty of Russia and the values it should hold. He speaks of two sharply contrasting visions of the future: either the Western system continues to exist and Russia is strategically defeated, or the Western system is replaced and Russia continues to exist. He is convinced that Russia has reached a historical crossroads in its post-Soviet development and that dismantling the existing global order and building a new one is fundamental to Russia's greater-power aspirations. His revolutionary push is motivated by both internal power-preservation aims and external power-expansion aims.\n\nHis revolution values Russian advantage and gain of power over the West more than coexistence, mutual security, crisis avoidance and stability with the West. His security vision requires a Europe without , and without organisations that uphold the fundamental principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. That vision also involves Russian co-operation with other countries to curb American power in the Arctic, Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions.\n\nHis \"all of Russia\" revolution and war are now shaping how Russia is organised, how society is mobilised, how industry is prioritised, how foreign policy is aligned, how the army is structured and how communications are conducted. His legitimacy as a leader of Russia -- and his place in history -- are now inextricably tied to this revolution. He portrays himself as the only leader who can guide Russia through this crossroads of history. Mr Putin's pursuit of advantage and power is unlikely to be replaced by caution in pursuit of stability.\n\nNeither his revolution nor his war is near its end. In Ukraine he is pursuing several strategic actions simultaneously. By intensifying military operations and attacking Ukraine's infrastructure he hopes to weaken its defence, demoralise its armed forces and create among the broader population a sense of inevitable Russian victory. He is also seeking to divide Ukraine politically. And he wants to damage the West's will to continue supporting Ukraine in the war.\n\nThe signs are that Mr Putin will continue to pursue this revolution-and-war approach, further locking the country's politics, economy and armed forces into a structure that can only sustain revolution and war. It is unlikely that he will stop the revolution, demobilise the armed forces, deconstruct the war economy or re-embrace acceptance of the Western system. It is equally unlikely that he will seek political, economic, conflict-resolution or arms agreements with Western countries. This revolution and war will put enormous stress on Russian society -- a price that Mr Putin appears willing to pay.\n\nMr Putin has chosen decisive paths to advance Russian power. He is leading Russia into a new phase of strategic confrontation with the West over the America-led regional and global order. Given his logic, this reality is not a temporary crisis-management challenge. The West must continue to support Ukraine's right to self-defence and strengthen the collective security and defence of the Euro-Atlantic area and globally, as part of a strategic pattern to manage Russia's pressure and assault on a global security system. Absent these steps, Mr Putin would have the opportunity to match a level of aggression against the Western system with his level of revolutionary ambition.\n\nIn late 2022, Mr Putin predicted that ahead lay \"probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and, at the same time, important decade since the end of World War II\" -- a state of affairs that he said was \"fraught with global conflicts\". His destabilising, calculated revolution and war against Ukraine -- Mr Putin's choices for Russia -- could make his prediction a reality. He is organising and preparing Russia for this future, not setting a course to avoid it. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frozen conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gestapo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-Soviet states"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20240612_BID001.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666300", "eventUri": "eng-9666300", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The deliveries to Ukraine will begin this summer, and it is not immediately clear how many countries are impacted.\n\nPrior to the decision, Ukrainian officials had clearly explained to the Biden administration that additional air defenses were critically needed as Russia continued its aerial assaults against its cities and civilian infrastructure.\n\n\"If we didn't do this for Ukraine, they would not have been able to maintain their critical air defense stockpile heading into the winter, period,\" the official said. \"This is a decision that's being made to ensure that they're able to defend themselves against these relentless Russian missile and drone attacks.\"\n\nPutting Ukraine at the top of the list to begin receiving \"sufficient quantities\" of these critical air defense capabilities - specifically the Patriot and NASAM interceptors - means that the US slid down other countries that were already in the queue to receive the weapons, the sources said.\n\nState Department and Pentagon officials are engaged in an \"intensive diplomatic effort\" to inform the effected countries that they will receive the interceptors on delayed timelines, the White House official said.\n\nUkraine is expected to get its first exports of the air defense capabilities this summer and the policy change will stay in place for 16 months, the official said. The other countries will then get the interceptors they ordered.\n\nLate last week, Pentagon and State Department officials briefed congressional leadership on the policy change, but refused to tell them which countries would be impacted, creating frustration. That information has yet to be shared with Congress, sources said.\n\nThe White House official would not share the list of affected countries, other than to say that air defense exports to Taiwan would not be impacted.\n\n\"So far, at least in the private discussions, many of these countries have understood and appreciated the necessity of this decision,\" the official said. \"If any of our partners were in an existential situation like the one that Ukraine is in right now, we would move heaven and earth to help them and it just so happens that right now that country is Ukraine.\"\n\nThe change is the latest shift from the Biden administration to ensure that Ukraine can continue to defend itself in the face of Russia's ongoing assault. Last month, Biden gave permission to Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory with American munitions, breaking from long-standing US policy - though he restricted their use.\n\nThe move is being done in parallel with Biden administration efforts to get Ukraine more air defense systems as well, a second White House official said.\n\nIt also comes as the Biden administration adapts its policy approach to the conflict to account for evolving battlefield needs, and as NATO and the G7 are shoring up assistance to Ukraine amid uncertainty over November's US presidential election.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, has threatened to cut US support for Ukraine, and the country's war effort was seriously hindered when Republicans in Congress stalled a major military aid package for months until it was eventually passed in April.\n\nMonthslong effort in the making\n\nThe idea to adjust the global list was first raised internally by national security adviser Jake Sullivan in mid-April when Russia was intensifying its air campaign against Ukraine and Congress had not yet passed a supplemental defense package with aide for the country.\n\nAround the same time, a lack of air defenses meant Ukraine was powerless to prevent a Russian airstrike that destroyed the biggest power plant in Kyiv region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n\nThe Pentagon proposed options after months of internal processes to examine how the change could be made. The plan to put Ukraine at the top of the list was finalized in late May.\n\n\"Our message to Russia is that if they think they can outlast Ukraine in this war, they're mistaken,\" the official said, adding, \"we are now effectively mobilizing our defense industrial capacity in order to get air defense interceptors that are rolling off the line straight to Ukraine, which will provide them with sufficient quantities to be able to defend against Russian air missile attacks for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nBiden shared the news with Zelensky last week when they met on the sidelines of the G7 in Italy, the official said.\n\nThe pair also announced that the US and Ukraine had signed a bilateral security pact that commits the US for 10 years to continued training of Ukraine's armed forces, more cooperation in the production of weapons and military equipment, the continued provision of military assistance and greater intelligence sharing.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType":

At the invitation of the Ukrainian Institute in Sweden, Mr Plokhii introduced his book \"The Gates of Europe: a History of Ukraine\", told the Swedes about our country, the Russo-Ukrainian war, and answered questions. The event took place at the Army Museum in Stockholm.\n\nThe importance of the Ukraine Peace Summit, what makes Ukraine strong, what can be considered our victory and Russia's defeat - Professor Plokhii revealed this all in an interview exclusive to Ukrinform\n\nphoto\n\n- Thank you for your activity, for being a Ukrainian voice in the West, an ambassador of the \"Secure Sky\" campaign. You are a very powerful voice in the world. You received a very sincere, warm reception, and was heard with extraordinary attention. There was out-and-out silence where you were talking about Russia's genocide, about the destruction of Ukrainian cities. You're lecturing all over the world. How audiences differ in different countries?\n\n- What unites all countries now is interest in Ukraine. This is what brings people to attend my lectures. But what attracts people most is, indeed, what is happening in Ukraine, that Ukraine is fighting, that it has not laid down its arms as the world expected in the first days and weeks of the war. This is what all countries have in common. I also noticed that a significant majority of people - as, for example, today in Stockholm - are friendly to Ukraine, which is a plus and a minus both at the same time. This adds to the atmosphere, makes meetings special and conversation more interesting on the one hand, but makes it less possible to persuade people with a different opinion on the other.\n\nI never choose audiences. In the USA too, for example, there are critics who come with sharp questions. An audience of skeptics, I think, is even more important than that of followers.\n\nWhat I saw here in Sweden today is either a culture of not asking critical questions, or this meeting brought together proponents of Ukraine. I really appreciate it.\n\n- We are meeting with you on the first day of the Summit on Peace in Ukraine, in Switzerland. It is quite representative - 100 delegations, 92 countries, 8 international organizations. How much does Biden's absence affect the status of the event? If he were there, would the gathering's outcomes have been different? Which ones?\n\n- In my understanding, his failure to show up will not affect the Summit's results. Some things, and we know about it already, some joint documents have been agreed upon. They were redrafted several times, there were debates, a common platform was developed around which to meet. I believe if Biden was there personally, a certain number of people would have attended, in addition to those who are already there. Maybe another joint photo would have come out. But I don't think it would have had any effect on the result. The USA is represented by the vice president. I am convinced that the American President shares what she says. So in terms of content, I don't think it matters. Everything was discussed beforehand -- with Biden and with other leaders who did not come. Participation of countries, high-level representation are what matters. The rest will be forgotten tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and the documents, the platform are what everyone is working for, that's what will remain.\n\n- Do you see any historical parallels with the Peace Summit? What analogies can be drawn?\n\n- The closest parallels, which may not be obvious, are the Allied World War II Conferences. Those we know well are Tehran, Yalta, Potsdam. None of the conferences was attended by the aggressor country. Allies in the fight against Germany were represented at these conferences. Today's conference is grander in terms of representation and the number of attendees; it is of a public nature. But the meaning is the same - Ukraine's allies came together to draft a common vision of peace.\n\nDifferent eras, different circumstances, different conferences, but they are common in that countries unite to stop the aggression and to deliberate about what the world should be like after the war is over.\n\n- In Ukraine, opinions are voiced that the Summit would not bring the results as expected or even bring the opposite result: Ukraine will be forced to agree to a ceasefire, a truce. There are also opinions that it would be better to provide us with weapons.\n\n- Firstly, weapons emerge as a result of talks. Weapons emerge where there is a common vision of the future that is now being developed at various forums and conferences. This Summit is one of the most representative in the world. So the view that there is something better than this forum is a very naive view. Without one, there would be no other.\n\nThe Summit represents the views of other participating countries. It gives a chance to hash out positions, to generate a common one. This is what makes the importance of the event. People come with own positions, maybe similar, but differing. They debate on them, find common ground. This is a significant consequence of this Summit.\n\nIf there is an understanding that the Summit was convened in order to end the war here and now, it is simply unrealistic. One side in this war and its allies are represented. Wars end up either with a victory of one side, or with the achievement of some kind of compromise. What we heard from Moscow the other day just cuts off all the chances and, actually, pulls the rug out from under those who argued that a compromise could be reached on the basis of what Vladimir Putin proposed. It's not just about keeping what has been captured, but about \"surrender more to us and then give up the resistance.\" I think that this Summit will be a significant step forward to developing a common platform. We have to give due credit to Vladimir Putin and the statement he made on the eve of the Peace Summit for making an important sign in Ukraine's favor. The aggressor has very explicitly demonstrated who he is. Following such a statement, it is much easier for Ukraine to argue and defend its position.\n\n- Does this statement by Putin signify Russia's weakness?\n\n- Definitely yes. This manifests inadequate understanding of a person who has been in power for 25 years. This creates a number of errors that are clearly contrary to Russia's best interests. No one will ever argue that the war went to Putin's plan. Such statements really exclude Russia as a legitimate negotiator. And this is not favorable for Russia. Empires, autocracies have advantages in terms of resource mobilization. At the same time, they have significant disadvantages in that bad decisions are made very often. This doesn't mean to say that this will make Ukraine feel any better, but that Putin continues driving Russia into a dead end.\n\n- Has the world realized that Russia cannot be trusted or negotiated with?\n\n- The world, its significant part, would certainly like come to terms with Putin. This was the view shared by Germany and France. Those countries offered themselves as negotiators in this process. However, the posture of Putin, who started an all-out war of aggression, who was unwilling to agree on anything and continues with such statements, turns potential negotiators into proponents of Ukraine and opponents of Russia. Putin once again knocked trump cards out of the hands of those who don't mind coming to an agreement with him.\n\nPhoto\n\n- The longer the war, the more abstract the concept of victory. What can be considered a victory for Ukraine and a defeat for Russia?\n\n- Victory can have many dimensions. We live in a world in which our ideas about victory are shaped by May 1945, the elimination of Nazi Germany, etc. This is the key paradigm that exists.\n\nThe world has changed since May 1945. It became nuclear capable, the rules of the game and understanding of a victory have changed. I would like to draw attention to the end of the Cold War, which was certainly won by the United States and its allies. And it's clear that the Soviet Union was definitely defeated. This understanding of a victory differs from the one we are associating with May 1945. We have to think in terms of whether or not there will be a victory.\n\nI would say that victory is a multi-layered phenomenon. In an environment where not only Ukraine's independence, but the very existence of the state of Ukraine, the Ukrainian nation have become the target for aggression, and this issue has not yet been ultimately resolved. The preservation of the nation, statehood, identity, and the freedom of choice - this is the pivotal part. This is how we should think about winning. Compromise on any of these key components will be a defeat, let alone victory.\n\nThere will likely be a compromise on aspects that do not affect the prime goals. It may not be the peace we want, or it will not be achieved right now, not immediately. But there can be a qualified victory. There are victories, as in boxing, by knockout or knockdown. Such was the victory in 1945. And there are victories by points, just like the Cold War was won.\n\nSo I think we should try and win by knockdown, but victory by points is still a victory. Because this is the preservation of our existence, independence and a security guarantee for the future. Theoretically, the war, in the sense of hostilities, could end today. But this would not mean an end to the war. Let's recall how it was in 2015. Then there was not an end, but a postponement of the war. Such scenarios are also possible.\n\nOver the past century, there have been many different models of victory and defeat. However, the key - for both victory and defeat - is what happens on the battlefield. There should be no illusions that if something goes wrong on the battlefield, the Summit in Switzerland will surprisingly fix it. Diplomats draw up the results of what militaries have won or lost at the front line.\n\n- What are your thoughts about whether or not this Great War could have been avoided?\n\n- It seemed to us that the war was managed to be avoided. I want to emphasize that Ukrainian victory will mean the victory and independence of several other countries that are not immediately involved in this war. Ukrainian victory will mean the weakening of Russia in Eastern Europe as a whole. Today, Moldova is a candidate for EU membership in consequence of Ukraine becoming a candidate for EU membership. We started this in motion.\n\nUkraine's victory will also be of significance for Belarus. There is a potentiality that certain countries will gain independence without a bloody war.\n\nWe are fighting a war not only for ourselves. And we could have other options. Nothing in history is absolutely deterministic. We must never be fatalistic. But a war was pretty likely, considering the collapse of other empires. And we proved unable to avoid it.\n\n- You always monitor the front line situation. How has it changed throughout this year?\n\n- This year began with two questions: what will Western aid be like and how will war mobilization proceed in Ukraine. We have an answer to the former question - the aid is delayed, but it is still coming in. We do not have an answer to the question about how the mobilization will end up. But it seems to me like the most troubled period, the Rubicon, the equator has been passed this year. The Russian offensive has been brought to a halt. Russia has most probably run out of strength, but we have the strength in place.\n\nLots of issues about the progression of the war are postponed till the next year. There is one more issue, specifically about how to survive the next winter season. This issue is going to be more pressing than it was in the previous war years. We will hopefully build up enough strength to tackle this situation in 2025.\n\n- What should we message to the West?\n\n- We currently need to communicate, with intensity, that Ukraine is fighting not only for itself, that the future of the world is at stake. And if, God forbid, Kyiv is defeated, this will entail very serious changes for the future of Europe and all of the world.\n\nThe key messages should be about what is happening actually. Not only is Ukraine fighting for itself, but it contributes more to this fight than anyone else. The West must defend itself in this war.\n\n- In interviews, you give optimistic predictions about Russian disintegration...\n\n- This prism of the collapse of empires gives me optimism for the future. The disintegration of the Russian Empire began during the First World War. Then Finland, Poland and others became independent. However, there were turnings back as well: the Baltic Sea countries were recaptured. There is an overall trend there. Given this, one must appreciate that a lot depends on the processes going on in Russia itself, and, of course, on us, as well.\n\nEmpires come through periods of rise and fall. The time of the empire's fall is most suitable for colonies, current and former, to consolidate their statehood.\n\nBut here a question arises: how effective were our attempts to consolidate our statehood at the time the empire was weak - between 1991 and 2014. I do not agree with those claiming that those were wasted years. If that were the case, Ukraine would not exist today. But I also share the doubts of those who inquire: had we used all the opportunities that came our way, how had we used this time that could probably have been put to much better use.\n\nThe Poles did better feeling the imminent fall that would come someday. They began knocking on the door of NATO. Now they are protected.\n\nThere are questions to be put to the then elites, but not only. Elites are like the people they lead. We remember what our reaction to NATO was. We then lost our time, our chance.\n\nPhoto\n\n- Since February 2022, many people in Ukraine have switched over from speaking Russian to Ukrainian. But many continue speaking Russian, especially in Kyiv. What's your opinion about why even this brutal war hasn't become an argument in favor of one's native tongue?\n\n- Ukraine has found a way how to fight, to being bilingual and multicultural. Had we failed to find a way to a common identity across the differences, we wouldn't exist anymore, or would exist within different national borders. Historical heritage, cultural and linguistic practices have a long-term development impact and are very conservative. The Ukrainian language was losing its position during centuries, not decades, and so we must be realistic about our expectations.\n\nToday, there is a movement toward speaking Ukrainian, a surge of Ukrainian culture has been observed, and that is the way the Ukrainians are responding to the war. This is not a State-imposed process, but it arises from the grass-roots level. This is a model of creation, a model for Ukrainization that does not cause division in society. This is what helps us sustain without undermining our capabilities. That said, we must be aware that we are aspiring to expedite the processes that have lasted for centuries.\n\n- One of your narratives says that international partners help and support only the strong ones. What makes Ukraine strong?\n\n- Ukraine has enough strength to inspire allies to support. Tangible assistance began coming in when Ukraine had been able to defend Kyiv and defeat Moscow outside of the capital city. At that time it became obvious that there is a State, there is an army, that there is a nation that supports fight for freedom and independence. And Western embassies returned to Kyiv. This signifies that the one who was able to defend itself is strong enough and can count on support. And the more Ukraine is proving this to be the case, the more potent the aid.\n\n- You travel many countries. What is your most favorite place to visit? Where is your place of strength?\n\n- I was in Kyiv and Zaporizhzhia in May. Then I felt that Ukraine was in a crisis, perhaps the most severe crisis since the time the war began. But I came back from Ukraine, surprisingly to myself, with greater strength and energy to fight. I cannot show my place of strength on the map of Ukraine. But I can show it on the world map.

As expected, no concrete proposals were reached. The event served only as a way for NATO and its proxy regime to unilaterally reaffirm their interests. The lack of Russian participation made the conference a real waste of time, completely incapable of establishing a real peace agenda.\n\nAny diplomatic negotiation obviously requires the presence of at least two parties interested in resolving a specific issue. Whether in a trade relationship or in a peace talk to stop a military conflict, it is impossible to conduct diplomacy with only one side. This would be enough to consider the meeting between Zelensky and his supporters in Switzerland truly useless. However, it is also necessary to remind that, in the case of a war, it is not only the presence of both sides that matters, but, above all, the presence of the winning side.\n\nFrom a realistic point of view, only the winning side can end a war. It is the terms set out by the winning country that ensure the end of hostilities in a conflict. The losing side can only accept the terms of peace, with the possibility at most of requesting some specific changes that do not alter the main demands. This is how wars have ended throughout history - and it will be no different in the current NATO proxy war with Russia through Ukraine.\n\nWith Kiev on the verge of total military collapse, incapable of taking effective mobilization measures and progressively losing territory, Ukrainian defeat is only a matter of time. The most rational and strategic thing to do would be to resume peace negotiations and accept Russian terms, thus avoiding further loss of lives and territory. However, the Ukrainian regime has no actual sovereignty, being simply a NATO proxy forced to fight \"to the last man.\" So, instead of really thinking about peace, Zelensky decided to organize a propaganda event where Western leaders reinforced their unrestricted support for war.\n\nIn fact, the event did not only serve to consolidate Ukraine and NATO's pro-war stance. The summit was also marked by several hate speeches and real threats against Russia. For example, Polish President Andrzej Duda called for the \"decolonization\" of Russia, openly advocating the division of the Russian Federation into multiple ethno-states. According to Duda, the more than 190 peoples living on Russian territory are held by force through colonial methods, and their \"liberation\" is possible only through the end of Russia as a country.\n\n\"Russia remains the largest colonial empire in the world, which, unlike European powers, has never undergone the process of decolonization and has never been able to deal with demons of its past (...) As a member of the international community, we have to finally say - there is no [space] for colonialism in the modern world,\" Duda said.\n\nThis is not the first time that NATO countries have threatened to work towards the dismantling of Russia's territory. Earlier, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas had already admitted that the main goal of the Atlantic alliance is to \"break\" Russia into dozens of \"small nations\". These threats seem to be becoming more and more frequent, which shows how peace between the West and Russia seems unfortunately far from being achieved.\n\nFor its part, however, Moscow has done everything possible to avoid prolonging the war and to reach a definitive ceasefire. A day before Zelensky's conference in Switzerland, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered the West and Kiev a concrete peace proposal. The main terms were the recognition of the four New Regions and Crimea as part of the Russian Federation and Ukraine's commitment to demilitarization. Putin demanded a formal promise from Kiev not to seek NATO membership. If these terms were met, the end of hostilities would be immediate.\n\nSince NATO has failed to open a new front to continue its proxy war against Russia, Ukraine is not allowed to accept any peace terms. So Zelensky rejected the proposal and preferred to continue with his plan to hold a completely futile \"peace conference.\" In several statements, Russian officials have made it clear that Moscow's upcoming new peace proposals will show conditions that are more unfavorable to Ukraine. It is expected that, given the insistence on war and also the recent threats of a conspiracy against Russia's own territorial integrity, Moscow will update its strategic and territorial interests, establishing the goal of liberating more areas currently under Ukrainian control, as well as demanding more guarantees from NATO.\n\nIn the end, the war really could have ended last week. NATO had only to allow Zelensky to accept Russia's terms. Then the winning side would establish peace, as has always happened in the history of wars.

But at the same time, they also say that they want to achieve a strategic defeat of Russia on the battlefield. What does this mean for Russia? For Russia, this means the end of its statehood.

Wouldn't it be better to go all the way then? This is elementary logic.\n\nEven though Putin repeatedly admitted that any conflict involving the use of nuclear weapons would have dire consequences for humanity, he has maintained that Moscow would be forced to defend itself using all available means if the country's very existence was at stake.\n\nBack in 2018, he famously said that \"as a citizen of Russia and the head of the Russian state I must ask myself: Why would we want a world without Russia?\"\n\nThe US and its allies have funneled weapons, ammunition, and equipment to Ukraine over the past two years, while insisting they are not a party to the conflict but want to inflict \"a strategic defeat\" on Moscow.

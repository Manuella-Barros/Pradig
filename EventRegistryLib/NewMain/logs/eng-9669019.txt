Stevenson will receive an $8 million signing bonus, per the NFL Network, and has an extra $12 million available in incentives, provided he reaches at least 1,400 yards and makes the Pro Bowl or an All-Pro team. The 26-year-old is one of the Patriots' best players and had been set to hit free agency next spring.\n\nBefore an ankle injury hit last December, Stevenson was tracking to lead the team in rushing for a second straight season. Instead, he finished with 619 rushing yards and a team-high four touchdowns over a dozen games. The season before, Stevenson emerged as one of the NFL's top backs, with 1,040 rushing yards, five touchdowns and a team-leading 69 catches.\n\nStevenson, a fourth-round pick in 2021, proved to be the Patriots' most dangerous back as a rookie, forcing then starter Damien Harris into a reserve role the following season. That year, Stevenson broke tackles at an elite rate and carried the offense almost single-handedly as a rusher and pass-catcher. His numbers dipped last year, which the front office apparently deemed to be a result of injury and poor offensive line play.\n\nPatriots Coach Jerod Mayo confirmed Stevenson was a priority for the front office, while speaking with reporters at the start of minicamp on June 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I will say this about Rhamondre. I think he's one of the better backs in the league, it's no doubt about it,\" Mayo said. \"I think over the last few years, it's been kind of tough on him, as far as getting started. So, I'm excited to see what he does this season. And look, he's earned everything that he gets. He is our starting running back and hopefully we do get something done.\"\n\nLater that day, Stevenson told reporters he'd lowered his body fat percentage in the offseason after recovering from his high-ankle sprain.\n\n\"I still weigh the same amount, but it's just better weight. I got my body fat down, so it's just better weight,\" Stevenson said. \"Just a little stricter diet. Nothing too crazy. ... Just to make sure my body is ready for the whole season. It's a long season. I've seen what that can get like, so I tried to prepare myself.\"\n\nStevenson added he'd received some advice from teammates about remaining patient while his agent handled negotiations with the front office.\n\n\"It's just a long process. This is how the process goes,\" Stevenson said. \"First time going through it, but just hearing from all of the other guys. This is how it goes. It's just a negotiation process.\"\n\nStevenson is the latest in a long line of core veterans to either re-sign or sign an extension this offseason. The Patriots re-signed wide receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebackers Anfernee Jennings and Joshua Uche and offensive tackle Mike Onwenu and extended center David Andrews and Christian Barmore earlier this year.\n\nStevenson and Antonio Gibson, who signed a three-year, $11.25 million deal in free agency, figure to lead the Patriots' running back room for the near future. Their backups include 2022 sixth-rounder Kevin Harris, JaMycal Hasty, Deshaun Fenwick and Terrell Jennings.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "sunjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lewiston Sun Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damien Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Barmore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Barmore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfernee_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfernee Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dugger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dugger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Bourne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Bourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/12/AP23337646325471-1701821722.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669019", "eventUri": "eng-9669019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1535}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

The Patriots re-signed wide receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebackers Anfernee Jennings and Joshua Uche and offensive tackle Mike Onwenu and extended center David Andrews and Christian Barmore earlier this year.\n\nStevenson and Antonio Gibson, who signed a three-year, $11.25 million deal in free agency, figure to lead the Patriots' running back room for the near future. Their backups include 2022 sixth-rounder Kevin Harris, JaMycal Hasty, Deshaun Fenwick and Terrell Jennings.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nFreeport adopts $16 million budget, with Freeport Community Services funding intact\n\nNext \"\n\nBath Area YMCA expands its summer food program for Brunswick families Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damien Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Barmore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Barmore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfernee_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfernee Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Dugger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Dugger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Bourne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Bourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YMCA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunswick,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brunswick, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brunswick, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Andrews_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Andrews (American football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/12/AP23337646325471-1701814177.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669019", "eventUri": "eng-9669019", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1535}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Brian Fluharty-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New England Patriots have signed one of their top offensive players to a contract extension.\n\nThe Patriots gave running back Rhamondre Stevenson a 4-year contract extension for $36 million. ESPN's Adam Schefter says the deal includes $17 million guaranteed.\n\nStevenson was a 4th-round pick by the Patriots in 2021 out of Oklahoma.

He was also an effective receiver, catching 69 passes for 421 yards.\n\nHowever, Stevenson was limited to 12 games last season after suffering a high ankle sprain in Week 13 that ended his season. Stevenson lost weight during the offseason and looked quicker in OTAs, prompting praise from new head coach Jerod Mayo.\n\nNow that a new contract is indeed done, Stevenson can focus on being the team's feature back. In his previous three seasons, he's split carries with Damien Harris and Ezekiel Elliott. New England signed free agent Antonio Gibson to a three-year deal, so the rushing workload should be divided again. But Mayo makes it sound as if he expects Stevenson to take the lead.\n\nStevenson likely staying with the Patriots for the next four seasons also provides him to establish a legacy with the franchise, as Schefter pointed out. With 2,265 yards going into this season, he is 3,188 yards away from overtaking Sam Cunningham as the team's all-time leading rusher.\n\nIf Stevenson averages 797 yards in each of the next four seasons, he'll catch Cunningham. He's averaged 755 yards during his previous three years, but he wasn't the starter as a rookie and, as mentioned, missed four games last season.\n\nConsidering that the Patriots will begin the season with Jacoby Brissett as quarterback as they work first-round pick Drake Maye in, the offense could rely heavily on the running game - especially early on.

Ahead of his fourth season in the NFL, the team has agreed on a contract extension for four years, $36 million. The Patriots selected Stevenson out of Oklahoma in the fourth round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Now, he'll be with the team through the 2027 season after ending 2023 on Injured Reserve.\n\nStevenson went down with a high ankle sprain in the Patriots' 6-0 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 3. The team opted to shut him down for the rest of the year with a move to IR. He was a critical piece of the Patriots' struggling offense before his injury.\n\nAlthough he only played in 12 games, he still led the team with 619 rushing yards -- 70 more than Ezekiel Elliott -- while also scoring a team-high four touchdowns on the ground at the time of his ankle sprain.\n\nThe 2022 season was a breakout campaign for Stevenson as he ran for 1,040 yards and five touchdowns. In his rookie season, he posted 133 carries and 606 yards in 12 games played. He also had five rushing touchdowns, bringing his three-year total up to 14.\n\nStevenson's new contract extension includes $17 million in fully-guaranteed money, according to NFL insider Adam Schefter. His rookie deal was for four years, $4.22 million. Without a contract extension, the former Sooners star would have become a free agent at the end of the season. His new deal makes him one of the top-10 highest-paid running backs in a market that has devalued his position over the last several years.\n\nThe NFL 2024 calendar year began at 4 p.m. ET on March 13. At that time, contracts running through 2023 officially ran out, making those players free agents. Prior to the beginning of free agency, teams had a chance to designate one franchise or transition tag player, starting on Feb. 20 at 4 p.m. ET and ending on March 5. Beginning March 11 through March 13 teams could enter into a legal negotiation with players who will become unrestricted free agents.\n\nIn addition to NFL free agency, the new year also marked the beginning of all trades being made official by the league office. April 19 marked the deadline to sign restricted free agents to offer sheets.

The deal, which extends him through the 2028 season, includes $17 million guaranteed.\n\nWith the total value of the deal at $36 million, that makes Stevenson the sixth highest paid NFL back behind Alvin Kamara, Josh Jacobs, Jonathan Taylor, Christian McCaffrey, and Saquon Barkley.\n\nMeanwhile, his average annual salary of $9 million per season slots him in as seventh-highest in the league behind McCaffrey, Kamara, Taylor, Barkley, Jacobs and Joe Mixon.\n\nDuring his first three seasons with the Patriots, Stevenson racked up 3,047 yards from scrimmage. He's been prominent both as a runner and pass-catcher.\n\nStevenson's best season came in 2022 when he rushed for 1040 yards, while catching 69 passes for 421 yards. In Alex Van Pelt's offense, Stevenson figures to be the focal point of the offense.\n\nDuring minicamp, Patriots coach Jerod Mayo told reporters he was hoping the team would keep Stevenson in the fold.\n\n\"I think he's one of the better backs in the league, no doubt about it,\" Mayo said of Stevenson, whose season was cut short last year due to an ankle injury. \"I think over the last few years, it's been kind of tough on him, as far as getting started.

He is our starting running back and hopefully we do get something done.\"\n\nThe signing keeps in line with the Patriots keeping many of their in-house players in the fold including Christian Barmore, who also received an extension while Kyle Dugger, Michael Onwenu and Hunter Henry were among those re-signed.\n\nUnder new offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt, the Patriots are expected to lean heavily on their run game. New running backs coach Taylor Embree said this spring that he expects Stevenson to be a huge part of the Patriots offense this year - and now, going forward.\n\n\"He's got a toughness. He's a competitor. He does a good job with the little stuff. Seeing him in person, you don't realize how good his feet are until you really see him,\" Embree said. \"Especially with how he plays, he's tough, low to the ground and has real good feet. He can make all the cuts, a good feel for everything, so it's been a pleasure. I'm excited for him.

Rapoport also noted the deal includes $17 million guaranteed, an $8 million signing bonus, and $12 million in incentives.\n\nStevenson had an underwhelming 2023 season plagued by injury. He recorded 857 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns before suffering a high ankle sprain in Week 13 that knocked him out for the remainder of the year. The Patriots are betting Stevenson's future is more closely aligned with his breakout 2022 season in which he put up 1,040 yards rushing and caught 69 passes for 421 yards, totaling six touchdowns.\n\nWhile Stevenson was part of the Patriots' worst season in many years in 2023 (and one of the more inept offenses in recent NFL history), this was the best move for New England. The organization has anointed Drake Maye, the No. 3 pick in the 2024 draft, as the heir apparent to the quarterback throne. One of the tried-and-true ways to help young quarterbacks succeed is to surround them with as much talent as possible offensively for as long as possible.\n\nThe Patriots are doing just that by inking Stevenson to a long-term agreement as he enters the final year of his rookie contract. His dual-threat capabilities will help keep the offense unpredictable, and he can be a workhorse out of the backfield as evidenced by his 279 touches in 2022. Stevenson isn't quite a home run hitter but he's a versatile back who will be put to good use in offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt's offense.\n\nNow the running back will be happy and healthy entering the 2024 season, ready to take the load off Maye or veteran journeyman Jacoby Brissett.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Chargers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Rapoport", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Rapoport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_USFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 USFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_ankle_sprain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High ankle sprain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-purpose_yardage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-purpose yardage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6434,h_3619,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0vj29ccrm4579rqjj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669019", "eventUri": "eng-9669019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He rumbled for 1,040 yards and five touchdowns (with a career-high 5 yards-per-carry average) during the 2022 season.\n\nRhamondre Stevenson is the latest NFL running back to receive a hefty contract extension. Stevenson and the New England Patriots have agreed to terms on a four-year, $36 million extension that will included $17 million guaranteed, according to ESPN.\n\nStevenson, 26, is entering his fourth season with the Patriots, who selected him with the 120th overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. The former Oklahoma standout has rushed for 2,265 yards and 14 touchdowns during his time with the Patriots. He rumbled for 1,040 yards and five touchdowns (with a career-high 5 yards-per-carry average) during the 2022 season.\n\nThe extension can reach up to $48 million if Stevenson can hit each of his season incentives that begin in 2025, via NFL Media. That season and through the 2028 campaign, Stevenson will receive $600,000 if he hits 1,400 all-purpose yards, an additional $600,000 if he hits 1,500 yards and $600,000 more if he can reach $1,600 yards. There are additional incentives for Pro Bowl and All-Pro recognitions.\n\nStevenson's new average annual salary of $9 million makes him the NFL's seventh-highest-paid running back, just behind Houston's Joe Mixon and just ahead of Baltimore's Derrick Henry. His contract comes shortly after Christian McCaffrey inked an extension that will pay him an average of $19 million annually.\n\nThe running back position has enjoyed a comeback this offseason after the position was grossly undervalued the previous several offseasons. Along with McCaffrey and Stevenson, Mixon, Philadelphia's Saquon Barkley and Green Bay's Josh Jacobs also signed lucrative, new deals this offseason in free agency. Several other running backs (including Henry, Washington's Austin Ekeler and Chicago's D'Andre Swift) also signed lucrative deals with new teams.\n\nGiven the news of Stevenson's extension, it's clear that he is part of first-year Patriots coach Jerod Mayo's long-term plans.

The deal includes $17 million of guaranteed money.\n\nStevenson, who was entering the final year of his rookie deal, is now under contract through the 2028 season. He is the latest Patriot to receive an extension, joining defensive tackle Christian Barmore and center David Andrews.\n\nIn their first year in their new positions, executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf and coach Jerod Mayo have clearly prioritized retaining New England's internal talent. In addition to extending three major contributors, the Patriots also re-signed six of their pending free agents in wide receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, tight end Hunter Henry, offensive tackle Michael Onwenu, and linebackers Anfernee Jennings and Joshua Uche.\n\nAmong running backs, a position for which the financial value has been highly scrutinized in recent years, Stevenson's deal ranks within the league's top 10 for average annual value and total guaranteed money.\n\nLast season, Stevenson rushed for 619 yards and four touchdowns before an ankle injury sidelined him for the team's final five games. His best NFL season came in 2022, when he eclipsed 1,000 rushing yards and also registered 421 receiving yards.\n\nThis season, Stevenson has expressed interest in serving as the offense's featured back. He previously split duties out of the backfield, first with Damien Harris and then Ezekiel Elliott. The Patriots in March signed Antonio Gibson to a three-year deal, but Stevenson is expected to maintain a larger role.\n\n\"I think he's one of the better backs in the league,\" Mayo said last week. \"There's no doubt about it. I think over the last few years, it's been kind of tough on him, as far as getting started. So, I'm excited to see what he does this season.\"\n\nTo prepare for the increased workload, Stevenson cleaned up his diet this offseason and reduced his body fat percentage. He also watched film of Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb to get a better sense of new offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt's run-heavy offense.\n\nDuring Van Pelt's four seasons in Cleveland, the Browns ranked near the top of the league in number of carries and rushing touchdowns.\n\nStevenson's deal was one of the last remaining dominoes to fall this offseason. Other transactions that could be coming are adjusted contracts for outside linebacker Matthew Judon and nose tackle Davon Godchaux.

The deal features $17 million in fully guaranteed money.\n\nNFL Network's Ian Rapoport provided more details on the financial aspect of the extension and noted Stevenson will receive an $8 million signing bonus plus the chance to make up to $12 million in incentives if he can reach 1,400 yards and become a Pro Bowler or All-Pro selection.\n\nThat the two sides were able to come to terms on a deal is far from surprising.\n\nAfter all, Stevenson told reporters earlier this month, \"Yeah, it's pretty close,\" when discussing an impending contract extension.\n\nNew England selected Stevenson with a fourth-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft, and he quickly established himself as an important contributor with 729 yards from scrimmage and five touchdowns. But it was his second year in 2022 when he enjoyed a breakout and became a featured back.\n\nHe posted 1,040 yards and five scores on the ground to go with 69 catches for 421 yards and one touchdown as a receiver. His ability to impact the game in multiple ways made him particularly valuable in today's NFL and allowed him to stay on the field more often.\n\nYet the 2023 campaign was somewhat disappointing from an individual perspective, as he saw his yards per carry drop from 5.0 to 4.0 while tallying 857 yards from scrimmage. That was well below the 1,461 he had the previous year, although he was limited to just 12 games.\n\nStevenson is still just 26 years old and figures to be a go-to option in the offense. He can also be a veteran leader as the team undergoes a transition from the Bill Belichick era to one with Jerod Mayo as the head coach and rookie Drake Maye as the quarterback.\n\nThis extension means he and Maye can establish some continuity for the foreseeable future as the quarterback adjusts to the NFL level.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamondre_Stevenson", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhamondre Stevenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Rapoport", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Rapoport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Education", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Essays", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1718911437/lcpuvtehdxxley7xqz4b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669019", "eventUri": "eng-9669019", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Stevenson will receive an $8 million signing bonus, per the NFL Network, and has an extra $12 million available in incentives, provided he reaches at least 1,400 yards and makes the Pro Bowl or an All-Pro team. The 26-year-old is one of the Patriots' best players and had been set to hit free agency next spring.\n\nBefore an ankle injury hit last December, Stevenson was tracking to lead the team in rushing for a second straight season. Instead, he finished with 619 rushing yards and a team-high four touchdowns over a dozen games. The season before, Stevenson emerged as one of the NFL's top backs, with 1,040 rushing yards, five touchdowns and a team-leading 69 catches.\n\nStevenson, a fourth-round pick in 2021, proved to be the Patriots' most dangerous back as a rookie, forcing then starter Damien Harris into a reserve role the following season. That year, Stevenson broke tackles at an elite rate and carried the offense almost single-handedly as a rusher and pass-catcher. His numbers dipped last year, which the front office apparently deemed to be a result of injury and poor offensive line play.\n\nPatriots Coach Jerod Mayo confirmed Stevenson was a priority for the front office, while speaking with reporters at the start of minicamp on June 10.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I will say this about Rhamondre. I think he's one of the better backs in the league, it's no doubt about it,\" Mayo said. \"I think over the last few years, it's been kind of tough on him, as far as getting started. So, I'm excited to see what he does this season. And look, he's earned everything that he gets. He is our starting running back and hopefully we do get something done.\"\n\nLater that day, Stevenson told reporters he'd lowered his body fat percentage in the offseason after recovering from his high-ankle sprain.\n\n\"I still weigh the same amount, but it's just better weight. I got my body fat down, so it's just better weight,\" Stevenson said. \"Just a little stricter diet. Nothing too crazy. ... Just to make sure my body is ready for the whole season. It's a long season. I've seen what that can get like, so I tried to prepare myself.\"\n\nStevenson added he'd received some advice from teammates about remaining patient while his agent handled negotiations with the front office.\n\n\"It's just a long process. This is how the process goes,\" Stevenson said. \"First time going through it, but just hearing from all of the other guys. This is how it goes. It's just a negotiation process.\"\n\nStevenson is the latest in a long line of core veterans to either re-sign or sign an extension this offseason. The Patriots re-signed wide receiver Kendrick Bourne, safety Kyle Dugger, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebackers Anfernee Jennings and Joshua Uche and offensive tackle Mike Onwenu and extended center David Andrews and Christian Barmore earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStevenson and Antonio Gibson, who signed a three-year, $11.25 million deal in free agency, figure to lead the Patriots' running back room for the near future. Their backups include 2022 sixth-rounder Kevin Harris, JaMycal Hasty, Deshaun Fenwick and Terrell Jennings.\n\nBROWNS: Cleveland cut defensive end Lonnie Phelps on Thursday following his arrest on drunken driving charges after he crashed his SUV into a Florida restaurant.\n\nPhelps was charged with DUI and damaging property on Wednesday night after authorities say he drove into an outdoor lounge area at Red Shoe Island Bistro in Key West.

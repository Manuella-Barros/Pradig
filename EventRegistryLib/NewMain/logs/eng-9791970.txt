However, despite the losses, the company maintained that its full expected revenue for 2024 should still be on track for \u20ac2.5bn-\u20ac3.1bn.\n\nThe financial report also revealed BioNTech's plans to quit the development of acasunlimab (BNT311/GEN1046), leaving the programme for Genmab to commandeer. BioNTech has chosen not to participate in the drug's Phase III development despite the release of positive interim Phase II trial data.\n\nThe bispecific antibody is currently in a Phase II randomised study (NCT05117242), investigating its use for non-small cell lung cancer. Interim data from the trial demonstrated that the drug showed a 12-month overall survival rate of 69% and a median overall survival of 17.5 months in combination with MSD's Keytruda (pembrolizumab). Genmab will present updated data from the study at the World Conference on Lung Cancer being held on 7 to 10 September\n\nThe split arrives after BioNTech and Genmab expanded their clinical collaboration in 2022 to research, develop and commercialise novel monospecific antibody candidates for various cancer indications. The companies have not shared plans to end the joint development of their other cancer assets, including BNT-313 and BNT-312.\n\nBioNTech shared that it would continue to focus on developing its antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) pipeline, including BNT323/DB-1303 and BNT324/DB-1311, both being shared assets with Duality Biologics.\n\nAside from its cancer pipeline, the company has directed its vaccine business plans towards selling adapted Covid-19 vaccines to meet the need for options targeting the Omicron JN.1 variant. This shift arrived after the World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration, and other regulatory agencies adapted their guidelines this year to recommend Omicron JN.1-adapted monovalent Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nIn the company's Q2 financial earnings report, BioNTech's CEO Dr Ugur Sahin said: \"We have started commercialising variant-adapted Covid-19 vaccines for the upcoming season while accelerating our clinical development efforts to realise the full potential of our technologies.

(ProfoundBio). The revised guidance reflects an updated revenue outlook, incremental R&D investment to support the advancement of ProfoundBio's clinical programs, primarily rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S), as well as acquisition and integration related charges.\n\nGenmab expects its 2024 revenue to be in the range of DKK 20.5 - 21.7 billion, an increase to the previous guidance of DKK 18.7- 20.5 billion, driven by higher royalties and reimbursement revenue. This increase in Genmab's revenue reflects the continued strong growth of DARZALEX and Kesimpta net sales.\n\nAs previously disclosed in Company Announcement Nos. 26.2024 and 28.2024, following the closing of the ProfoundBio acquisition, Genmab's operating expenses not including expenses incurred in connection with acquisition and integration charges, were expected to be at or moderately above the upper end of the previously disclosed guidance range of DKK 12.4 - 13.4 billion. Genmab has updated its operating expense range excluding acquisition and integration charges to DKK 13.7 - 14.3 billion. The increase primarily relates to the incremental R&D investment to support the advancement of ProfoundBio's clinical programs, primarily Rina-S as well as a revenue and expense classification change for programs that remain in Genmab's collaboration with BioNTech SE (BioNTech). This classification change has resulted in Genmab increasing both cost reimbursement revenue and operating expense by approximately DKK 600 million, resulting in no impact on operating profit. Excluding the DKK 600 million related to the classification change and the acquisition and integration charges, the underlying operating expense range remains within the directional financial guidance provided at the time we announced the ProfoundBio acquisition. Including acquisition and integration related charges, Genmab expects operating expenses for 2024 to be in the range of DKK 14.1 - 14.7 billion.\n\nGenmab now expects its 2024 operating profit excluding acquisition and integration related charges to be in the range of DKK 5.3 - 7.1 billion, compared to the previous guidance of DKK 4.6 - 7.1 billion, primarily driven by the items described above. Including acquisition and integration related charges, Genmab expects operating profit for 2024 to be in the range of DKK 4.9 - 6.7 billion.\n\n*Net Product Sales and Collaboration Revenue consists of EPKINLY Net Product Sales in the U.S. and Japan and Tivdak (Genmab's share of net profits) in the U.S.\n\n**Operating Expenses Range excludes Cost of Product Sales Range, which is included in Gross Profit Range\n\nGenmab's financial results for the first six months of 2024 will be published immediately following the publication of this Company Announcement, on August 8, 2024.\n\nThe above expectations are based on assumptions including those described on pages 5 and 6 of the Interim Report for the first quarter of 2024 (Company Announcement No. 33/2024).\n\nAbout Genmab\n\nGenmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose of guiding its unstoppable team to strive toward improving the lives of patients with innovative and differentiated antibody therapeutics.

(ProfoundBio). The revised guidance reflects an updated revenue outlook, incremental R&D investment to support the advancement of ProfoundBio's clinical programs, primarily rinatabart sesutecan (Rina-S), as well as acquisition and integration related charges.\n\nGenmab expects its 2024 revenue to be in the range of DKK 20.5 \" 21.7 billion, an increase to the previous guidance of DKK 18.7\" 20.5 billion, driven by higher royalties and reimbursement revenue. This increase in Genmab's revenue reflects the continued strong growth of DARZALEX and Kesimpta net sales.\n\nAs previously disclosed in Company Announcement Nos. 26.2024 and 28.2024, following the closing of the ProfoundBio acquisition, Genmab's operating expenses not including expenses incurred in connection with acquisition and integration charges, were expected to be at or moderately above the upper end of the previously disclosed guidance range of DKK 12.4 \" 13.4 billion. Genmab has updated its operating expense range excluding acquisition and integration charges to DKK 13.7 \" 14.3 billion. The increase primarily relates to the incremental R&D investment to support the advancement of ProfoundBio's clinical programs, primarily Rina-S as well as a revenue and expense classification change for programs that remain in Genmab's collaboration with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) (BioNTech). This classification change has resulted in Genmab increasing both cost reimbursement revenue and operating expense by approximately DKK 600 million, resulting in no impact on operating profit. Excluding the DKK 600 million related to the classification change and the acquisition and integration charges, the underlying operating expense range remains within the directional financial guidance provided at the time we announced the ProfoundBio acquisition. Including acquisition and integration related charges, Genmab expects operating expenses for 2024 to be in the range of DKK 14.1 \" 14.7 billion.\n\nGenmab now expects its 2024 operating profit excluding acquisition and integration related charges to be in the range of DKK 5.3 \" 7.1 billion, compared to the previous guidance of DKK 4.6 \" 7.1 billion, primarily driven by the items described above. Including acquisition and integration related charges, Genmab expects operating profit for 2024 to be in the range of DKK 4.9 \" 6.7 billion.\n\nNet Product Sales and Collaboration Revenue consists of EPKINLY Net Product Sales in the U.S. and Japan and Tivdak (Genmab's share of net profits) in the U.S.\n\nOperating Expenses Range excludes Cost of Product Sales Range, which is included in Gross Profit Range\n\nGenmab's financial results for the first six months of 2024 will be published immediately following the publication of this Company Announcement, on August 8, 2024.\n\nThe above expectations are based on assumptions including those described on pages 5 and 6 of the Interim Report for the first quarter of 2024 (Company Announcement No. 33/2024).\n\nAbout Genmab\n\nGenmab is an international biotechnology company with a core purpose of guiding its unstoppable team to strive toward improving the lives of patients with innovative and differentiated antibody therapeutics.

The Mets carried a 2-1 lead into the ninth inning against the Giants on Saturday before Edwin Diaz blew the save, his third straight blown save opportunity. The Giants then went on to win 7-2 in 10 innings. \u201cBoy oh boy,\u201d Keith Hernandez said in the 10th inning on the PIX11 broadcast, as the Giants extended their lead from 4-2 to 7-2 on a Mike Yastrzemski triple. \u201cIt feels like the sky is falling.\u201d Saturday\u2019s loss was the Mets\u2019 fifth in a row and seventh in eight games, and they fell to 21-30 \u2014 a season-worth nine games under .500. \u201cIt has felt like that virtually every day for the last month,\u201d Gary Cohen replied to Hernandez. Then Ron Darling chimed in. \u201cGood grief,\u201d he said. It didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cIt seems the recitation is the same every game,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cPlayers say we\u2019re better than this, we have to play better, we just have to keep a positive attitude. \u2026. But how hard is it to keep a positive attitude when the roof is caving in every day?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a battle,\u201d Darling answered. \u201cThere\u2019s losing, and then there\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. And it\u2019s two different things. This is just gut-wrenching.\u201d Cohen did attempt to provide a bit of hope. \u201cRemember, the sun will come up tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAs difficult as that may be to realize.\u201d The players themselves didn\u2019t shy away from their downfall, either. \u201cThe bottom line is, we\u2019re not executing at the right times and we\u2019re not winning games,\u201d Francisco Lindor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hurry up and start winning games.\u201d \u201cWe have to stay optimistic and stick with each other. We understand we\u2019re gonna get through this. It\u2019s just a matter of when. We\u2019ve got to hurry up and start winning ballgames; work, grind, stay the course [and] try to get out of this.\u201d", "summary": "The Mets' announcers didn't hold back on the team's spiraling season.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/sports/mets-announcers-sum-up-sad-state-of-team-sky-is-falling/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/mets-announcers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716724060&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:45:32", "author": "Jared Schwartz", "authors": ["Jared Schwartz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.5}

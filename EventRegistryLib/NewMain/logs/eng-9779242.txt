Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, which is expected in the fourth quarter, Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. is acquiring the attest assets. MHM is a national independent CPA firm with which CBIZ has had an administrative service agreement for over 25 years.\n\nApproximately half of the $2.3 billion transaction consideration will be paid in cash and the remainder in shares of CBIZ common stock.\n\nCBIZ and MHM together ranked No. 11 on Accounting Today's 2024 list of the Top 100 Firms, with $1.42 billion in annual revenue. Marcum ranked No. 13 and has approximately $1.2 billion in revenue and more than 3,500 professionals. Combined, CBIZ will have more than 10,000 team members and over 135,000 clients. CBIZ provides finance, insurance and advisory services in more than 120 offices in 33 states, while Marcum has 43 offices in major markets across the U.S.\n\n\"Today marks the most significant transaction in CBIZ's history as we announce our agreement to acquire Marcum,\" said CBIZ president and CEO Jerry Grisko in a statement Wednesday. \"At closing, our company will have combined annual revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, more than 10,000 team members and over 135,000 clients. Together, we will provide a breadth of services and depth of expertise that is unmatched in our industry, allowing us to bring a broader array of high-value solutions to our combined client base. This transaction enables CBIZ to strengthen our presence in key markets, continue to attract and retain top talent, and innovate through technology. We are excited about our future together and the opportunities it will provide our people, the solutions we will bring to our clients and the value we expect it will create for shareholders.\"\n\nNeither firm was under pressure to merge, but as their competitors grow, they saw opportunities for joining together.\n\n\"We've both enjoyed a lot of success and revenue, but the combination of these two was just too good to pass up and accelerates our growth strategy to become the firm of choice to the market,\" said Chris Spurio, president of CBIZ Financial Services, in an interview with Accounting Today.\"\n\nThe two firms had been in talks about a combination. \"We've been talking to them for a very long time, but things really started ramping up late in 2023,\" Spurio added. \"We've been at it since then, culminating in the announcement today.\"\n\nIntegration is being carefully planned. \"We have a very thoughtful integration plan that we've been working around,\" said Spurio. \"Initially it's going to be focused on our clients. It's also going to be about aligning those mission critical platforms and systems. We're colocated in many markets, getting those teams together and starting to build those relationships so we can go to market as an organization that will now be the seventh largest in the U.S. But the integration will happen in a plan that will span over 18 to 24 months and has several phases to it. It's thoughtful, but ambitious as well. We will continue to serve our clients with the same level of service they have come to expect throughout the process.\"\n\nThe firms may not be expanding geographically right away since they already both have huge footprints. \"Geographically, they have 43 offices located in the Northeast, New York metro, D.C., Florida and California, and that is where we are co-located,\" said Spurio. \"It just allows us to scale up dramatically in those markets. For example, if you think about our New York metro and New England practices, those will instantly double, and our mid-Atlantic -- Philly, Pennsylvania and Maryland -- those quadruple. Our Florida and California practices scale up significantly as well. It's not so much new markets, but adding tremendous size, scale and expertise and industry knowledge to many of the markets that we provide. And they're interested in a lot of the markets we're in that they're trying to get in the Midwest, Kansas City, Salt Lake City that we have. I think it's a very interesting combination from that perspective.\"\n\nThere will be more opportunities for employees and clients as well. \"Both organizations are really excited about the opportunities,\" said Spurio. \"We'll be able to provide the clients the kind of services and solutions they need and provide our employees with the kind of experiences and career paths that they want.\"\n\nFounded in 1951, Marcum provides a variety of professional services, including tax, attest, accounting, and advisory services, as well as technology solutions and executive search and staffing services for entrepreneurial companies, midcap and micro-cap SEC registrants, and high-net-worth individuals.\n\n\"CBIZ and Marcum share a dedication to providing high-quality innovative professional services to our clients, and personalized, local client relationships supported by national resources,\" said Marcum chairman and CEO Jeffrey Weiner in a statement. \"By joining forces, we will capitalize on our strengths and leverage our similar models to bring more diversified services and even greater subject matter expertise to our clients and attract new business. We both have a proven track record of growth through successful acquisitions, and we are excited to bring these two best-in-class organizations together.\"\n\nIn an email to clients, Weiner added, \"This strategic acquisition presents an incredible opportunity for CBIZ and Marcum to bring together the best talent in the industry to offer our clients an exceptional breadth of services and depth of expertise. Together, we'll become the seventh-largest accounting and advisory services provider in the nation. Our combined force will deliver exceptional accounting, tax, advisory, business, and insurance services to middle-market clients and attract and retain the best and brightest talent.\"\n\nAllan D. Koltin, CEO of Koltin Consulting Group, who has advised both firms over the past two decades but wasn't involved directly in the deal, commented, \"This deal is groundbreaking and puts a big exclamation mark on whether or not non-CPA firm ownership can work in the accounting profession. Not only will this create the seventh largest CPA and advisory firm in the country, it will also increase the number of PE firms and related investment groups entering the accounting profession. The accounting profession has been around for 137 years, but it's never had a day like today!\"\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 subject to the approval of CBIZ's stockholders, the approval of Marcum's partners and other customary closing conditions. Perella Weinberg Partners is serving as CBIZ's financial advisor and BakerHostetler is serving as CBIZ's legal advisor for the transaction. Deutsche Bank is serving as Marcum's financial advisor and Dechert LLP is serving as Marcum's legal advisor for the transaction.\n\nMore information about the transaction .\n\nBoth CBIZ and Marcum have participated in many M&A deals.

Upon closing, CBIZ will become the seventh-largest accounting services provider in the U.S. The cash-and-stock transaction valued at approximately $2.3 billion is expected to close in the fourth quarter. CBIZ incurred approximately $6.7 million in fees related to the Marcum transaction and results for the second quarter are impacted by $0.10 per share. The press release announcing this transaction is available on CBIZ's website at https://cbiz.gcs-web.com/investor-overview.\n\nSecond-Quarter and First-Half 2024 Results\n\nDuring the 2024 second quarter, CBIZ experienced the departure of a small group of producers and support staff within our Property and Casualty business and a loss of clients served by this group. Included in reported results is the impact of $0.03 in Adjusted earnings per share for the 2024 second quarter and first half. The impact to full-year 2024 Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.06.\n\nExcluding nonrecurring acquisition-related integration expenses and professional fees incurred related to the Marcum transaction, Adjusted net income was $25.0 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared with Adjusted net income of $27.6 million for the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 for the second quarter of 2024, a decrease of 9.1%, compared with Adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $50.7 million, down 6.9%, compared with $54.4 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nSchedules reconciling Adjusted net income, Adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the tables included at the end of this release.\n\nThe balance outstanding on the Company's unsecured credit facility on June 30, 2024, was $381.0 million, with $209.8 million of unused borrowing capacity.\n\nCEO Commentary\n\nJerry Grisko, CBIZ President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We are pleased to report that our second-quarter results were generally in line with our expectations and that the overall health of our business remains strong. At the same time, we did experience a small number of unique headwinds that impacted our results for the quarter. Among these headwinds were the exit of a small group of producers from our Property and Casualty Insurance business and some evidence of clients delaying investment decisions and tightening discretionary spending. While our clients remain largely optimistic about the second half of the year, we find that any uncertainty in the market is amplified in an election year given concerns around regulations and interest rates. The nature of our resilient business model, with a high rate of recurring revenue and variable expense, enables us to maintain our performance even in less predictable business conditions.\"\n\nGrisko continued, \"This morning we announced our agreement to acquire Marcum. After closing, the new, combined business will solidify our position as a leading provider of professional services to middle market businesses and is projected to be accretive to Adjusted Earnings in its first full year of operations. On a combined basis, we will become the seventh-largest accounting services provider in the country with revenues of approximately $2.8 billion, will employ over 10,000 team members and will serve more than 135,000 clients with a unique breadth of services and depth of expertise, including Benefits & Insurance services. We are excited about our future together and the opportunities this will provide to our people, the solutions we will bring to our clients, and the value we expect to create for our shareholders.\"\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nWith an expected close in fourth quarter of 2024, our current guidance excludes the impact of the Marcum acquisition. Based on expectations for the remainder of 2024, and due to the projected $0.06 per share full year impact of the loss of Property and Casualty business, the Company expects the following:\n\nConference Call\n\nCBIZ will host a conference call at 11 a.m. (ET) today to discuss its second-quarter and first-half financial results as well as the Marcum acquisition announcement.

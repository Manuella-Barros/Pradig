It is believed that lord Vishnu reincarnated in the form of lord Krishna on the auspicious day of Janmashtami. The historical background of the birth of lord Krishna depicts the significance of this Hindu festival. Lord Krishna was born at midnight on the eighth day of Hindu lunar month. Telly actresses celebrate Lord Krishna's Birthday each year. They share about the significance of Janmashtami in their life.\n\nHelly Shah: Every aspect of lord Krishna's life is captivating no matter whether it is naughtiness of an infant Krishna, Krishna's life in Gokul, Krishna's romance with Radha or assassination of cruel Kansh. God never asks for material things. A deity wants attention from his devotees. I devote myself fully towards lord Krishna and make the festival of Janmashtami special.\n\nAlso Read: Janmashtami festival: The myriad hues of Janmashtami in Bollywood\n\nYuvika Chaudhary: The tale of Krishna's birth is recited and remembered on the day of Janmashtami from temples and households. The story signifies the divine power of lord Krishna. Devotional songs are sung which are dedicated to lord Krishna. Cities all over India get into a trance like mode. On the day I visit temple, Pray to lord by joining my hands and bow my heads in front of Krishna's idol with enormous faith. I also cook Prasad for lord myself.\n\nShubhangi Atre: Lord' birth on earth as Kanha is celebrated as Janmashtami. The festival is no less then Diwali, Decorating to making sweets for kanha and the fragrance in environment is so pure and special. I enjoy to watch Dahi Handi, as it is celebrated to mimic the stealing of butter by Krishna. An earthen pot containing butter, ghee (milk fat), dry fruits and milk is hung at a height with the help of a rope. Energetic men make a human pyramid and climb on each other to reach the pot and the break the pot. Later Dahikala (ingredients in the pot) is distributed among everyone. Dahi Handi celebration encourages working in a team, thus signifies the importance of team work.\n\nDevoleena Bhattacharjee: Krishna Janmashtami has always been important day in my life. Luckily I'm known as Gopi only. And I feel Krishna is close to me as my friend, Protector. Have seen and enjoyed the fest. It is always to be part of birth-celebration of lord. The way small cradle is placed with a miniature Krishna's idol in it as a symbol of his birth. Devotees swing the cradle joyously and celebrate the arrival of Shri Krishna by reciting aarti (prayer) and bhajans. Devotees fast for the whole long day, they break their fast in the midnight or on the next day. The fast is usually a waterless fast. Fragrance of the flowers, soothing aroma of burning camphor and jingle of the temple bells fill the atmosphere with divinity.\n\nTejasswi Prakash: Lord Krishna has been super hero in everyone' life from a small kid to old man, his company is for all. I have read and heard about him a lot. So, I keep lots of faith on him. The verses in the Bhagavad-Gita (a sacred book narrated by Lord Vishnu) says, that whenever there will be predominance of evil and decline of religion, he will reincarnate to kill the evil and to save the good. The main significance of Janmashtami is to encourage goodwill and to discourage bad will. Krishna Jayanti also celebrates togetherness. The holy occasion brings people together, thus it signifies unity and faith.\n\nMahika Sharma: Janmashtami is so fun-filled occasion. It brings so much positivity in air. Devotions arises in every heart and soul. I celebrate the day and visit temple to greet Kanha, A happy birthday gifting him some home made butter. Shri Krishna, as a child was very naughty. He loved butter. He would steal butter prepared by the young girls in Gokul. When the gopis complained to his foster mother Devaki, she ran behind him with a stick in hand to punish him. She could not catch infant Krishna. She decided to tie him with a rope. Krishna allowed her to tie him as he knew that his mother loves him a lot. She did not punish him. She scolded Krishna and told him not to steal butter again. Krishna's charismatic smile made her heart melt. She hugged little Krishna. Thus little Krishna got the name, Makhanchor (one who steals butter) due to this.\n\nShrenu Parikh: Janmashtami is celebrated as the birthday of Lord. The main significance of this festival lies in encouraging the goodwill and discouraging the bad will. Krishna Janmashtami is also celebrated for the togetherness. This holy festival brings all the people together. Hence Krishnashtami symbolises faith and unity. We celebrate the day at home by offering prayers and holy mantras are chanted for Sri Krishna. We also prepare sweets at home. We fast for the day and at midnight 12 we perform jhulan-puja offering him Mishri. Before that we give holly bath to lord. Most interesting is to watch Plays that are organized in the streets or in the parks and small children dressing like Sri Krishna.\n\nTanya Sharma: The festival of Janmashtami is special. We celebrate lords' birthday and thanks him for everything. The day is symbol of absolute faith of people in Lord Krishna. The enthusiasm of people can be witnessed in all parts of the country and the zeal with which Janmashtami is celebrated is unmatchable. Lord Krishna was born to free the earth from all kinds of evil and its sources. The God even spread the message of kinship and fraternity. He stressed 'karma'. He also advised Arjun during the battle of Mahabharata. I and my family celebrate the day offering prayers and sweets to lord.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357712", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T04:44:00Z", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "title": "freepressjournal.in", "id": "12557"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:44:00", "url": "http://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/telly-actresses-share-about-the-significance-of-janmashtami-in-their-life/1119619", "storyUri": "eng-3357712", "id": "8744479", "image": "http://www.freepressjournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Janmashtami-Festival.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "04:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Believers keep day long fast and pray till mid night to rejoice the birth of Lord. On this day the images of Bhagwan Krishna are placed on swing and are worshipped as Kanha besides well decorated and colorful processions is taken with messages from Bhagwan Krishna's life. Special events of Raas Leela, enactment of Krishna's youthful days is showcased to convey the subtle message of compassion, love, humility and glory of Lord.\n\nDevotees recite the story and teachings of Sri Krishna from the Magnum Opus of Rishi Vyasa's Mahabharata besides chanting the shlokas from The Bhagwad Gita the metaphysical chapters narrated by Sri Krishna to Arjuna in the battle field of Kurushetra. Temples of Sri Krishna are fully decorated and children are fully adorned as Lord Krishna and Radha - the spiritual companion of Krishna. Sri Krishna leela or the plays form the Krishna's life are enacted and fast is broken at mid night.\n\nThe central motif of Krishna's life for mankind is the aspiration to embody all that is divine. Affectionate and loyal, his playful nature is gentle reprimand to remain good natured in the face of life's challenges. According to Rishi Vyasa after shedding his body as Ram, Lord Vishnu ascends to Vaikuntha, his celestial abode on the ocean of milk, and then returns with a new body, that is Krishna for the emancipation of humanity who are suffering in the world of casualty.\n\nBhagwan Sri Krishna is described as -\n\nMakhan Chor - One who steals butter\n\nChitta Chor - One who steals one's heart\n\nRana Chor - One who runs away from battle and lives to fight another day\n\nLeela Purushottam - The supreme play-actor\n\nThe birth of Krishna is an absorbing one. It goes that Mother Earth appealed to Lord Brahma to help reduce sins on Earth. Seeing Mother Earth's genuine urge to get rid of sin's Lord Brahma prayed to Lord Vishnu for help who in turn promised that he will take birth on Earth and will destroy every kind of sin and restore justice, peace and dharma in order to save humanity from falling to appalling conditions.\n\nJanamashtami Special\n\nDuring Lord's time Kansa was a tyrant who ruled Mathura and was responsible of putting Vasudev and Devaki in prison as there was a prophecy that 8th child of Devaki shall be responsible for the annihilation of Kansa and his tyrannical rule. Frightened Kansa vows to kill all the children of Deviki. Kansa was successful in killing first seven infants. When Divine eighth baby is born Vasudeva finds himself magically freed from prison and he takes the infant across the river Yamuna to a family of cowherds and exchanging him for a new born girl. Kansa on learning the birth of a child rushes to prison to kill the infant who in turn slips from his hands and conveys to Kansa that his despotic rule is about to end and the one who will annihilate him is born and is safe. Subsequently in later years Krishna kills the tyrannical Kansa.\n\nSri Krishna was a perfect communicator, motivator, strategist, coach and leader. During battle of Mahabharata he did not pick any weapon as promised to Arjuna and was in fact a charioteer to Arjuna. He was a motivator and mentor of Pandava's thus as a motivator he was inspiring confidence in them so that they can make correct judgement, develop right understanding among themselves and work for the victory which was for righteousness and establishment of justice. Krishna acted like a coach to Pandava's at every step as they had completely surrendered to Him for the outcome of the battle. This conveys the message to humanity that Lord is ready to help the myriad souls who completely beseech him as he is the final refugee.\n\nSri Krishna is also associated with Raas Leela as his playfulness encompasses all aspects of human tastes which includes music, dance, love, compassion, aesthetics and spirituality. Infact he is closely associated with various art and dance forms since the beginning.\n\nSri Krishna serves as an ethical compass to Arjuna who is confused and frightened in the battle field of Mahabharata. He not only encourages him to fulfill the role of a warrior but announces the great mystical truths in the form of Bhagvad Gita - the Divine Song which since time immemorial acts as a guiding force across the world among believers.\n\nIn Bhagvad Gita - Sri Krishna implores humanity that he will keep on saving the humanity from the evils and sins from time to time and will establish justice, righteousness and lawful order so that humanity lives in peace and achieves the transcendental state of Moksha.\n\nSri Krishna is depicted with blue- black color holding flute and accompanied by a cow. Krishna is also known by many names among them Govinda, Madhusudhana, Gopala and Vasudeva are popular. On Janamashtami Krishna is depicted as infant or a child who is engaged in playful pranks such as that of stealing butter.\n\nIn Kashmir since earlier times Sri Krishna's birth is celebrated a day earlier than rest of the country. The reason being as the Lord was born on midnight hence a fast prior to his birth was kept by the devotees in accordance with astrological calculations. The earlier references of Sri Krishna Janamashtami can be found in Nilmat Puran where it is mentioned that Lord Krishna his consort besides Devaki and Yashoda were worshipped and devotional hymns sung amidst vocal and instrumental music. People used to prepare purified butter and barley food along with sugarcane which was partaken as prasadam. The Avantiswamin temple depicted Krishna with the cow herds besides a river in North Kashmir was referred as Kishan Ganga.\n\nTherefore, let us whole heartedly pray to Lord Krishna - The Leela Purshottam to give us enough wisdom, strength, honesty, humility and knowledge so as to serve humanity with righteousness and bring peace and prosperity in our family and nation.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357712", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:35:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "dailyexcelsior.com", "title": "Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K", "id": "10160"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:35:00", "url": "http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/leela-purushottam/", "storyUri": "eng-3357712", "id": "8835494", "image": "http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kanha.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:35:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

celebrated across India. This year Janmashtami has fallen on August 14, Monday. The festival is one of the most important festivals of the Hindu religion. As per the Hindu lunar calendar, the Lord Krishna was born on the 'eighth day' known as 'Ashtami' at midnight in the holy month of Shravana. Hindus across the entire country and abroad are gearing up for the most significant festival. It is popularly celebrated in Mathura, in parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan and in the northeastern states like Assam and Manipur, as per the reports by The Indian Express.\n\nSignificance of Janmashtami\n\nLord Krishna is believed to be the eighth avatar of Vishnu. According to the mythological tales, Lord Krishna's uncle King Kansa wanted to kill him, therefore, as soon as he was born, his father Vasudeva took him across Yamuna to Gokul. Krishna was then taken care of by his foster parents Nanda and Yashoda. As per the report by Indian Express, on Janmashtami, devotees commemorate how Krishna emerged victorious over the trials and tribulations over his birth.\n\nRasa lila, fasting (upavasa), a night vigil (jagarana) and a festival (mahotsava) are considered as important parts of the Janmashtami celebrations. People do fasting by eating just a single meal a day before the festivities and break the fast on the next day when the Ashtami Tithi is over. People in the night, maintain a vigil and sing devotional songs.

He features regularly on various TV channels.\n\nThe festival of Janmashtami falls on August 14, 2017. It is celebrated with great enthusiasm all over India. Lord Krishna is believed to be the only god who is the master of all arts, which include divine power, charismatic smile naughtiness as an infant; love for everyone; including his romance with Radha as an unconditional and eternal. On this day, his wonderful Raas Leela is performed by the artists in many parts of the country. Lord Krishna is believed to be a true lover of devotees, who remember him with a pure mind.\n\nAstrologically, the Moon entered the house of Taurus in Rohini Nakshatra in the month of Shravana, when Lord Krishna was born. He is the epitome of spiritual love, which is represented by planet Venus. It is believed that influence of Venus is the strongest on Janmashtami. Venus is the lord of seventh house; which pertains to love, romance and marriage. When Venus is aspected by a malefic (harmful) planet, the native does not enjoy the family bliss. Broken relationships, separation, divorce and marital discord are seen in the seventh house. Any prayer or remedy if done on this day or verses sung in favour of Lord Krishna, devotees get their desires fulfilled, pertaining to relationships, love and marriage.\n\nIt is believed the couples in love and desirous to get married should keep a fast on Janmashtami. They are advised to donate milk, curd, silver, honey and ghee. They should recite the following mantra: Aum Devkisut Govind Vasudev Jagatpate Dehi mein tanye Krishan tavmeh sharnagatam.\n\nAny devotee who is not in a position to recite the mantra, can have alternative remedy. He should write 11 names of Lord Krishna on plain paper and keep it in his/her house in a sacred place. Lord Krishna will fulfill the desire of devotee. The 11 names are: Makhanchor, Devkinandan, Keshav, Madhusudan, Krishna, Madhav, Govinda, Shyam sudar, Nand-Gopal, Murlidhar and Chakardhari.\n\nFlute is considered to be an ornament of Lord Krishna. It has seven surs (tones). It also pertains to seven grehs/ seven days/ seven colours. Flute is a symbol of sound, which signifies planet Mercury, the planet of education, writing, expression, acting, music. The flute can definitely bring prosperity in the lives of models and actors. According to Vastushastra on Janmashtami, if two wooden flutes are installed in 90 degree in the South direction, it can help bring happiness and prosperity in life.\n\nAns: Although there are not many factors to support an early marriage, a progressive period is ahead after February 15, 2018.

The romantic comedy became a staple in pop culture and has since remained a classic in its genre. However, Mulroney said it took quite some time for him to find new acting roles after \"My Best Friend's Wedding,\" and he thinks it's because he wasn't prominently featured in the ads for the movie, according to The New York Times.\n\nMulroney explained it was a full year after the release of the blockbuster rom-com before he was able to land another acting job.\n\n\"I was sitting there ready for the gift with purchase that was supposed to come along with being in a popular movie, and instead, I probably didn't work for a year,\" he told The New York Times.\n\nHe evaluated the situation and came to a conclusion.\n\n\"I chalked it up to me being so tiny on the poster, the little guy on the cake,\" Mulroney said.\n\n\"I thought, gosh, you guys, if you'd made me a little bigger, maybe I could have gotten a job.\"\n\nThe famous actor eventually went on to land dozens of other jobs in Hollywood, but it's clear he still questions the visuals used to promote \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\" (RELATED: 'She's Not Pretty, She Can't Act': Hollywood Producer Carol Baum Rips Into Sydney Sweeney: REPORT)\n\nHis latest rom-com appearance happens to be alongside the \"it\" girl of the year, Sydney Sweeney, in \"Anyone but You,\" as he takes on the role of her father in the film.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermot_Mulroney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dermot Mulroney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Best_Friend_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "My Best Friend (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Diaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Everett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rupert Everett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Sweeney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1606709093-e1714065838557.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513697", "eventUri": "eng-9513697", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

In the film, Julianne tries to win over Michael, her best friend, after Michael gets engaged to Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz).\n\nOn the official movie poster, however, Roberts' face takes up the most real estate while Mulroney is portrayed as a small figure on top of a wedding cake.\n\n\"I was sitting there ready for the gift with purchase that was supposed to come along with being in a popular movie, and instead, I probably didn't work for a year,\" Mulroney told The New York Times in a story published on April 23. \"I chalked it up to me being so tiny on the poster, the little guy on the cake. I thought, gosh, you guys, if you'd made me a little bigger, maybe I could have gotten a job.\"\n\nWhile Mulroney's career did slow immediately after My Best Friend's Wedding, he's done just fine for himself in the years since. His next film, Goodbye Lover, was a box office flop, but Mulroney found his footing again in 2002's comedy-drama About Schmidt, and then in 2003 when he played Gavin Mitchell on Friends.\n\nAnd it's not like his appearance on the movie poster meant he was forgettable in his role. Mulroney also told the Times that he's still approached daily by fans of the film who tell him they grew up watching it with their grandmothers.\n\nMulroney's most recent rom-com, Anyone But You, was another box office hit, grossing $219 million on a $25 million budget. While working on the film, he was able to share his expertise in the genre with Glen Powell, the male lead starring alongside Sydney Sweeney.\n\n\"I didn't want him to do what I did, which was minimize how important something is that might feel a little light or a little fluff when you're doing it,\" he said. \"'What these movies mean to people,' I told Glen, 'will last for decades.'

I thought, 'Gosh, you guys, if you'd made me a little bigger, maybe I could have gotten a job.' \"\n\nIn the classic film, Mulroney plays Michael, the suave, childhood best friend of food critic Roberts' Jules. Although Jules still harbors a crush on Michael after many years, he shows up engaged to 20-something billionaire Kimmy (Diaz), and she hatches a plan to get him back.\n\nJules' attempts to thwart the wedding are unsuccessful: the film ends with Kimmy and Michael happily married, after Jules almost ruins the wedding by confessing her love to Michael, leaving her to dance with her friend George (Rupert Everett) at the reception.\n\nDespite a decline in acting opportunities following the '97 hit, Mulroney recently found rom-com success again when he starred as Sydney Sweeney's father in Anyone but You -- and he offered his costar and the film's leading man Glen Powell some advice on how to avoid the post-rom-com slump.\n\n\"I didn't want him to do what I did, which was minimize how important something is that might feel a little light or a little fluff when you're doing it,\" Mulroney said of Powell, 35. \" 'What these movies mean to people,' I told Glen, 'will last for decades.'

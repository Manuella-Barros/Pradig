These Olympics 'only the beginning'", "body": "NANTERRE, France -- These Paris Games undoubtedly belonged to L\u00e9on Marchand, the 22-year-old Frenchman from Toulouse. Here, he won four Olympic gold medals in four individual events, a feat that had only previously been achieved by Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz.\n\nThose are the names, and that is the rarefied air that Marchand finds himself in now. He just put on one of greatest individual performances at a single Olympics -- golds in the men's 200- and 400-meter individual medleys, plus the 200-meter butterfly and 200-meter breaststroke -- and already everyone wants to know: What will he do next? And just how high is the ceiling for a swimmer like Marchand?\n\n\"For me, it is not over -- it is only the beginning,\" Marchand said. \"I'm really excited (for what's next). My next goal is L.A. 2028 for sure, and I just want to keep swimming.\"\n\nMarchand said he will continue to train with his coach, Bob Bowman. The pair has worked together since Marchand got to Arizona State in the fall of 2021, a relationship that led to 10 individual NCAA titles and the Sun Devils' first NCAA team title in program history. Marchand then went pro and moved with Bowman to Austin, Texas, when Bowman changed jobs earlier this year.\n\nBowman opted to work as an assistant coach for Team France ahead of these Olympics so he could spend more time around Marchand as his personal coach and to avoid making his relationship with Marchand a distraction for the U.S. swim team, the roster he usually works with. That decision allowed Bowman to spend time with Marchand at his home in Toulouse as well as with the French team at its training camp ahead of the Games.\n\nAll of that paved the way for four individual gold medals and a bronze relay medal, a new national hero crowned.\n\n\"We shared amazing moments here,\" Marchand said. \"I don't know how to do the next part (of my career), and I think he will really help me with that, because he knows a lot about it.\"\n\nBowman absolutely does. He famously coached Phelps from age 11 onward, by his side for all 23 of his Olympic gold medals. He experienced the breakout Games in Athens (six golds, two bronzes) and everything that happened after -- the fame, the pressure, the training to stay at that level, the chase for perfection four years later in Beijing. He's lived it, and he'll live a variation of that now with Marchand.\n\n\"Doing what he did at a home Olympics -- it's really extraordinary,\" Bowman said by phone. \"It's almost impossible.\"\n\nBowman hadn't even been sure Marchand could do what he did. He'd been suggesting that they pick one of the 200 fly/200 breast and drop the other. Bowman had always figured Marchand would have to drop one to give himself the best chance at the other (and the 200 IM, which would take place later on in his program). But Marchand always planned on doing both, Bowman said. The two discussed the topic in Toulouse before the French national team went to its training camp, and there Marchand convinced Bowman to make a final decision later on, after the 400 IM final on the second night of the Games. (Marchand obviously got his wish.)\n\nMoving forward, Bowman said Marchand will obviously keep swimming both individual medley events.\n\n\"The IMs are his best thing,\" Bowman said. \"But I also think there's a ton of room for improvement in them.\"\n\nBowman would like to see Marchand focus on the 200-meter freestyle over the next year or so, because he considers the first year of the four-year period leading into an Olympics a good time to experiment and stretch swimmers a bit. Bowman would also like Marchand to explore both the 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter breaststroke.\n\nAsked about the possibility of increasing Marchand's workload (and medal opportunities) with more relays, Bowman said \"it would help.\" He acknowledged that relays were a huge part of Phelps' medal tally, as well as other decorated Americans, such as Caeleb Dressel. Twelve of Phelps' 28 total medals came from relays. One of the most iconic moments of his career was one, the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay in Beijing that included arguably the greatest split in Olympic history by Jason Lezak to keep Phelps' eight-gold dreams alive. The Americans have always prioritized relays, and they've always performed well in them. They almost always medal, regardless of gender or relay structure, and when they do, it's usually gold.\n\n\"The French are not as deep on relays,\" Bowman said. \"He'd need to have some support on them.\"\n\nSo, relays might hinder Marchand's effort to chase down Phelps' overall medal tally. But the potential addition of the 200 free or another individual event could position Marchand for an opportunity to try to match Phelps with five individual gold medals at the same Olympics. It's all hypothetical right now, and meet schedules (with specific events in certain orders) heavily influence individual swimmers' programs. But it's an appetizing idea, nonetheless.\n\nEither way, Bowman looks back on the past week as an experience that was special for Marchand, not just because he went four-for-four in gold but because he did it at a home Olympics. There was so much added stress and additional pressure for him to succeed because so much was riding on him to deliver as the face of the Games.\n\n\"It's a testament to the quality of his ability to rise to the occasion,\" Bowman said. \"He's like this, and Michael was like this, but it's only like 1, 2 percent of people who are like this. When the pressure is the very highest, they give their best performances. He did that.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicole_auerbach@nytimes.com", "name": "Nicole Auerbach", "type": "author",

But it's hardly a stretch to say Marchand's performance at La Defense Arena was downright Phelps-like.\n\nIn the space of about two hours Wednesday night, Marchand won gold medals using two very different strokes, both times with the defending champion from the Tokyo Games in the lane next to him.\n\n\"I'm so very proud of him,\" Bowman said of his latest star pupil. \"That's a tremendous, historic effort. It just shows the incredible work that he's done for many years to get here.\"\n\nWith the same sort of precision that Bowman use to chart out for Phelps, Marchand rallied on the final lap to beat world-record holder and 2021 gold medalist Krist\u00f3f Mil\u00e1k in the 200-meter butterfly with an Olympic-record time, hustled to the practice pool for a warm down, returned to the deck for the medal ceremony, disappeared again to begin prepping for his next race, then blew away the field -- including defending champ Zac Stubblety-Cook -- to claim gold in the 200 breaststroke while setting another Olympic record..\n\nWhew!\n\nMarchand has been unflappable under intense pressure\n\n\"The way he handled it, his attitude about it, was amazing,\" Bowman said. \"The way that he moved through the different parts of it and how to do it were just exactly right. There hasn't been a part yet that seems that tough.\"\n\nThe 22-year-old Marchand started his Olympics with a flourish, swimming away from everyone in the 400 individual medley on Sunday.\n\nYet, it was the audacious double that assured he will go down as one of the faces of these games, especially when it was accompanied by a rollicking home crowd of more than 15,000, who held up cardboard cutouts of his smiling face, adorned themselves in the tricolore and nearly blew the roof off the place with each rendition of \"La Marseillaise.\"\n\n\"It's not easy because you want to enjoy the 15,000 fans that are here to see you,\" Marchand said. \"But I still enjoyed it without losing too much energy or focusing too much on my emotions.\"\n\nOther Olympic champions are impressed by Marchand's performance\n\nEveryone else seemed to grasp that they were just bit players in The Marchand Show.\n\n\"It was awesome, watching him walk out,\" Stubblety-Cook marveled. \"I think it was the most exciting part of that whole race, watching him soak it all up and have his moment.\"\n\nComparing Marchand's performance to great moments by Phelps\n\nBowman watched Phelps do some amazing things.\n\nSwimming afficionados still marvel over the 2003 world championships in Barcelona, where an 18-year-old Phelps set a world record in the semifinals of the 100 butterfly and returned about an hour later to set another world record to win the 200 individual medley.\n\nThen, of course, everyone remembers the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, where Phelps -- swimming day after day after day, including several doubles -- pulled off the inside straight of eight gold medals in eight events, taking down Mark Spitz's iconic Olympic record.\n\nHow does Marchand's feat compare to those?\n\n\"It's up there,\" Bowman said.\n\nA child of swimmers, Marchand has been preparing for this for years\n\nThe son of French medley swimmers Xavier Marchand and C\u00e9line Bonnet, L\u00e9on didn't appear overwhelmed in the least by his stunning performance.\n\nHe's been building to this moment for several years now, providing the first real glimpse of what was possible at the 2022 worlds championships in Budapest, where he swept the individual medleys and grabbed silver in the 200 butterfly.\n\nMoving to the United States to attend Arizona State University and train under Bowman only accelerated the comparisons to Phelps. That might have overwhelmed some swimmers, but it only seems to have spurred Marchand to greater heights.\n\n\"I really enjoyed every moment of those two finals,\" Marchand said. \"It was really amazing for me to swim. Those were really good opponents, too.\"\n\nWhat's next for Marchand?\n\nHe isn't finished yet.\n\nMarchand returned to the pool about 12 hours later for the preliminaries of the 200 IM on Thursday, an event that now seems like a lock for his fourth gold medal. He posted the third-fastest qualifying time to breeze into the evening semifinals.\n\n\"My body is hurting a lot right now,\" he said. \"It's fine, because I'm trained for that.\"\n\nMarchand is also expected to swim on at least one relay, though his medal chances are much slimmer because France doesn't have the depth of powerhouse nations such as the United States and Australia.\n\nWill Marchand be a celebrity beyond the pool?\n\nStill to come is the victory tour.\n\nBowman watched Phelps become a worldwide phenomenon, doing everything from hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" to becoming a favorite name to drop in rap lyrics.\n\nMarchand has yet to fully grasp what awaits him away from the pool. How he handles all that attention will largely determine where his career goes from here, amid speculation that his best is yet to come at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.\n\n\"The key thing for him, which sadly I know about, he doesn't know about yet,\" Bowman said. \"He's got to come out of what's next and he has no idea. But I know exactly what's next and then somehow, he has to find his way back to a pool in Austin, Texas (where Bowman now coaches) and start going up and down.\"\n\nNo matter what happens over the rest of a still-burgeoning career, Bowman will encourage Marchand to cling to the memories of what he accomplished on one magical night in the western suburbs of Paris.\n\n\"I just hope,\" the coach said, \"he remembers everything about it.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"},

Night after night, Marchand transformed the converted rugby arena on the western outskirts of Paris into a red-hot sounding board, captivating a nation of 68 million.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without Bob Bowman, the most successful coach in American swimming, best known for discovering Michael Phelps at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and turning his raw talent into a winning machine before coaching the American to 23 Olympic gold medals and 28 overall. Now Bowman has struck gold with another pool prodigy whose future is bursting with promise.\n\n\"It's an incredible series of events,\" he said. \"I feel like he's done everything we could expect from him in this environment, in this kind of build-up and preparation. He couldn't have handled himself better between all the races. So it's just been a complete success... He's just 100% successful. So I'm very proud of him, it takes a lot to be perfect.\"\n\nFour years ago, shortly after accepting his coaching job at Arizona State University, Bowman received an email from a French teenager who hoped to attend college and train in the United States.\n\nDear Sir, I am a French swimmer, my name is L\u00e9on Marchand (18 years old). I would like to go to Arizona State University in the summer of 2021 to swim and compete in the NCAA with your great team. Do you think I could qualify for a scholarship? What level of education is required? (TOEFL, SAT...) Please find attached my presentation sheet. Thank you for the time you spent on my request.\n\nFrom a sporting point of view, Leon\n\nBowman had never heard of the sender, though he recognized the last name and correctly deduced that his parents were swimmers. The coach, who was trying to build a national contender from scratch at the Tempe school, wrote back.\n\nAfter a series of Skype conversations that left both parties impressed, Marchand accepted a full scholarship with the Sun Devils, forging a partnership that resulted in 10 individual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles in three seasons and the Sun Devils' first NCAA team title. When Bowman left Arizona in the spring to take a job at the University of Texas, Marchand made the 1,000-mile move to Austin to continue working under him.\n\nShortly after, Bowman, who had served as head coach of the U.S. swimming team, joined the French coaching staff as an assistant, so he could continue to work directly with Marchand in the run-up to the Olympic Games on home soil. That raised some eyebrows in his home country, where Bowman has been a fixture on the decks of U.S. teams for two decades, either as an assistant or head coach.\n\nBy stepping down from his U.S. coaching duties, Bowman has the freedom to coach students regardless of nationality. That includes American backstroke swimmer Regan Smith, who won three individual silvers and two relay golds in Paris and often trains with Marchand. The same goes for Hungary's Hubert Kos, who won gold in the 200m backstroke on Thursday.\n\n\"The magic touch is the work,\" Kos said of Bowman. \"He doesn't let us be second best. He doesn't let us stoop to a level that he doesn't want us to be. That brings out the best in us.\"\n\nIt all set the tone for the past week, as Marchand made La D\u00e9fense Arena the canvas for his groundbreaking pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. France international Antoine Griezmann was among the cheering supporters as Marchand won the 400-meter individual medley for his first gold on Sunday. As he completed the sweep on Friday, matching a feat achieved by Phelps and Mark Spitz, television cameras captured French President Emmanuel Macron. pumping his fist.\n\nPerhaps the highlight of Bowman's week came on Wednesday, when Marchand dethroned two Olympic champions - Hungary's Kristof Milak in the 200m butterfly and Australia's Zac Stubblety-Cook in the 200m breaststroke - in the space of 90 minutes. In doing so, he became the fourth swimmer to win two individual gold medals on the same day, a feat last accomplished by East Germany's Kornelia Ender in 1976.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Bowman said. \"I don't know if I've ever seen someone win two individual events [in the same session]. Tonight was amazing, he will never forget it. Honestly, this whole meeting is about fulfilling a promise I made to a child three years ago and I was able to keep it, because it was not only a challenge for him, but a huge challenge for me.\n\n\"Seeing it all come together and blossom, it's incredibly satisfying to be able to help him get to this moment.\"\n\nAfter completing the historic sweep on Friday night, Marchand said he will continue training with Bowman. \"We've shared some great moments here. We've worked really hard for the last three years. I don't know how to do the next part [of my career]. I think he will really help me with that, because he knows a lot about it.\"\n\nIf understatement were an Olympic sport, Marchand might have won a fifth gold medal there. The duo is eyeing the Olympics in four years in Los Angeles, where the swim will be held before a record 38,000 spectators at SoFi Stadium, home of the NFL's LA Rams and Chargers. Bowman was as optimistic as ever, saying that Marchand was just getting started and could eventually compete in other events, such as the 100m butterfly, as his physical condition strengthens with time.\n\n\"He can do better,\" said Bowman, who already ranks Marchand among the best swimmers of all time. \"He hasn't reached his potential yet. He can definitely swim faster. I put him at the top right now because he's just got the total package. He's got the speed, he's got the endurance, he's got the underwater world.\"", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

One night after another, Marchand transformed the converted rugby arena in the western Paris suburbs into a white-hot cauldron of sound, holding a country of 68m souls in his thrall.\n\nRelated: Marchand owned the Games but controversy still surrounds swimming | Andy Bull\n\nNone of it might have been possible without Bob Bowman, the most successful coach in US swimming, best known for discovering Michael Phelps at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club, sculpting his raw talent into a winning machine before coaching the American to 23 Olympic golds and 28 in all. Now Bowman has struck gold with another pool prodigy whose future is bursting with promise.\n\n\"It's an incredible series of events,\" he said. \"I feel like he did everything that we could possibly expect of him in this environment, in this sort of lead-up and preparation. He couldn't have handled himself better in between all the races. So it was just a complete success ... He's just 100% successful. So I'm very proud of him, it takes a lot to be perfect.\"\n\nFour years ago Bowman, soon after taking the coaching job at Arizona State University, received an email from a French teenager hoping to attend college and train in the United States.\n\nBowman had never heard of the sender, though he recognized the surname and correctly deduced his parents had been swimmers. The coach, who was trying to build a national contender from scratch at the school in Tempe, wrote back.\n\nAfter a series of Skype calls that left both parties impressed, Marchand accepted a full scholarship with the Sun Devils, forging a partnership that yielded 10 individual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles in three seasons and the Sun Devils' first NCAA team title. When Bowman left Arizona to take a job with the University of Texas in the spring, Marchand made the 1,000-mile move to Austin to keep working under him.\n\nSoon after, Bowman, who had worked as the head coach for the US swimming team as recently as last summer at the world championships in Fukuoka, joined the French coaching staff as an assistant so he could continue working with Marchand directly in the run-up to a home Olympics. That raised some eyebrows back home, where Bowman has been a fixture on the deck for American teams, as an assistant or head coach, for two decades.\n\nBy recusing himself from his US coaching duties, it has freed Bowman up to coach pupils regardless of nationality. That includes the American backstroker Regan Smith, who collected three individual silvers and two relay golds in Paris and often trains with Marchand. Same for the Hungarian Hubert Kos, who surged to 200m backstroke gold on Thursday.\n\n\"The magic touch is the work,\" Kos said of Bowman. \"He doesn't let us be second-best. He doesn't let us stoop down to a level he doesn't want from us. That brings out the best in us.\"\n\nAll of it set the stage for the past week, when Marchand made La D\u00e9fense Arena the canvas for his epochal pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The France international footballer, Antoine Griezmann, was among the roaring supporters when Marchand won the 400 individual medley last Sunday for his first gold. When he completed the sweep on Friday, matching a feat achieved by Phelps and Mark Spitz, television cameras captured the French president, Emmanuel Macron, pumping his fist.\n\nPerhaps the high point of Bowman's week came on the Wednesday, when Marchand dethroned two Olympic champions - Hungary's Kristof Milak in the 200m butterfly and Australia's Zac Stubblety-Cook in the 200m breaststroke - within 90 minutes. That made him the fourth swimmer to win two individual golds in the same day, a feat last accomplished by East Germany's Kornelia Ender in 1976.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Bowman said. \"I don't know that I've ever seen somebody win two individual events [in the same session]. Tonight was amazing, he'll never forget it. Quite honestly, this whole meet is about me fulfilling a promise I made to a kid three years ago and that I could come through and deliver because not only was it a challenge for him, it was a huge challenge for me.\n\n\"To put it together and see it come to fruition, it's incredibly satisfying to be able to help him meet this moment.\"\n\nAfter completing the historic sweep on Friday night, Marchand said he will continue training with Bowman. \"We shared amazing moments here. We've been working really hard over the last three years. I don't know how to do the next part [of my career]. I think he will really help me with that, because he knows a lot about it.\"\n\nIf understatement was an Olympic sport, Marchand might have added a fifth gold right there. The pair will turn their sights to the Los Angeles Olympics in four years' time, where the swimming will be staged before record crowds of 38,000 spectators at SoFi Stadium, the home of the NFL's LA Rams and Chargers. Bullish as ever, Bowman said Marchand was only getting started and could also take part in other events by then, such as the 100m butterfly, as his physical frame becomes stronger with time.\n\n\"He can be better,\" said Bowman, who already ranks Marchand among swimming's all-time greats. \"He's not reached his potential. He can definitely swim faster than that. I'm ranking him at the top right now because he's just got the total package. He's got the speed, he's got the endurance, he's got the underwaters.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

He chased down world-record holder and defending Olympic champion Krist\u00f3f Mil\u00e1k to win the 200-meter butterfly in 1 minute 51.21 seconds, and then claimed the 200 breaststroke about two hours later in 2:05.85.\n\nMarchand was back for the preliminary heats of the 200 individual medley Thursday. He swam easily and recorded the third fastest time to advance.\n\nDaiya Seto of Japan clocked 1:57.48 with Marchand third in 1:57.86.\n\nMarchand now has three gold medals in individual events in Paris and will go for his fourth on Friday night in the final 200 individual medley.\n\nThat may complete his haul in Paris in front of adoring, chanting, flag-waving fans at the La Defense Arena. It's unclear if he will swim any relays for France, which is not considered a medal contender in those events.\n\nGetting the fourth gold might be the easy part. His American coach Bob Bowman -- he coached Michael Phelps to 23 Olympic gold medals -- knows the next phase may be more demanding for the 22-year-old.\n\n\"He's gotta survive the success,\" Bowman said after Wednesday's two-gold haul. \"He's gotta come out of what's next, and he has no idea.\"\n\nBowman coached Marchand at Arizona State before moving on to coach Texas. Marchand turned pro and followed Bowman to Austin, and the coach says he'll have to deal with a new level of attention from sponsors and fans back home.\n\n\"I know exactly what's next,\" Bowman said. \"Find his way back to a pool in Austin, Texas, and go start going up and down it.

When he completed the sweep on Friday, matching a feat achieved by Phelps and Mark Spitz, television cameras captured the French president, Emmanuel Macron, pumping his fist.\n\nPerhaps the high point of Bowman's week came on the Wednesday, when Marchand dethroned two Olympic champions - Hungary's Kristof Milak in the 200m butterfly and Australia's Zac Stubblety-Cook in the 200m breaststroke - within 90 minutes. That made him the fourth swimmer to win two individual golds in the same day, a feat last accomplished by East Germany's Kornelia Ender in 1976.\n\n\"I'm so proud of him,\" Bowman said. \"I don't know that I've ever seen somebody win two individual events [in the same session]. Tonight was amazing, he'll never forget it. Quite honestly, this whole meet is about me fulfilling a promise I made to a kid three years ago and that I could come through and deliver because not only was it a challenge for him, it was a huge challenge for me.\n\n\"To put it together and see it come to fruition, it's incredibly satisfying to be able to help him meet this moment.\"\n\nAfter completing the historic sweep on Friday night, Marchand said he will continue training with Bowman. \"We shared amazing moments here. We've been working really hard over the last three years. I don't know how to do the next part [of my career]. I think he will really help me with that, because he knows a lot about it.\"\n\nIf understatement was an Olympic sport, Marchand might have added a fifth gold right there. The pair will turn their sights to the Los Angeles Olympics in four years' time, where the swimming will be staged before record crowds of 38,000 spectators at SoFi Stadium, the home of the NFL's LA Rams and Chargers. Bullish as ever, Bowman said Marchand was only getting started and could also take part in other events by then, such as the 100m butterfly, as his physical frame becomes stronger with time.\n\n\"He can be better,\" said Bowman, who already ranks Marchand among swimming's all-time greats. \"He's not reached his potential. He can definitely swim faster than that. I'm ranking him at the top right now because he's just got the total package. He's got the speed, he's got the endurance, he's got the underwaters.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And Salam\u00e9, whose beat is usually politics, has also been dismissed for not having enough sporting experience to host a show ostensibly focused on the Olympic Games.\n\nThat didn't stop Marchand from being greeted like a hero on Monday night, when he visited Club France, the Olympics' largest fan zone which brings together a daily average of 40,000 people and winning French athletes. The frenzied crowd that erupted into loud cheers and chants of \"Leon President\" as soon as the Olympic champ walked on stage.\n\nWhile he's not seeking a career in politics, Marchand also counts French President Emmanuel Macron among his most fervent fans. Macron was seen jumping for joy at the Paris La Defense Arena when Marchand won his fourth gold medal on Aug. 2. The French President, who saw his popularity collapse after dissolving the French National Assembly and calling snap elections shortly before the start of the Olympics, later posted a picture of him shaking Marchand's hand on X with a message saying \"Impossible isn't French! Four GOLD medals at home and a new Olympic record, it's historic. It's Leon Marchand.\n\nMarchand, who relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, three years ago, looked like a fish out of the water as he stepped under the spotlight. Speaking to hysterical fans at Club France on Monday, the athlete said, \"I don't have much to say. Guys, you were monstrous. Really. It was huge to see you in the stands. You are making the Games magical. So thank you all, truly.\"\n\nMacron does owe Marchand a great deal. The champion has largely contributed to making these Olympics a success, and switching French people's mood -- from gloomy to euphoric -- in less than 10 days. He's also helped France reach its historic record of 48 medals so far, placing the country in the third slot behind the U.S. and China.\n\nIn an interview with France Televisions' host Anne-Sophie Lapix, said \"due to (his) education,\" he is \"humble.\" \"My parents are here to remind it to me. I'm keeping my feet on the ground. I also have studies on the side,\" said Marchand, who is studying computer science at the Arizona State University.\n\nAddressing his sudden fame, he told Lapix that \"It's a big change for sure. I'm quite reserved. I prefer being at home with my parents rather than being on stage in front of 15,000 people.\"\n\n\"It's not easy for me after nine days of intense competition. I realize my new status. (...) Being in front of 15,000 is not really my comfort zone. (...) And for a photo shoot I had to wear the five medals around the neck; it's heavy!\" he said with a smile, adding that seeing supporters \"up close\" during the competition was \"a great moment.\"\n\nNicknamed \"the dolphin\" by his French supporters, Marchand moved to Arizona to train with Bob Bowman, the coach of 23-time Olympic gold medalist American swimmer Michael Phelps. He told Lapix that he prepared these Olympic Games for five years. \"This week is rewarding. It's a lot of work.\" In an interview with AFP (picked up by Le Figaro) in February, Marchand revealed he shared a house with four other swimmers about 10 minutes away from campus and woke up every day at 5 am to train starting at 6 am.\n\nWhile he's done with swimming competitions, Marchand said he will be sticking around for the finals of basket, volley ball and athletics. Marchand is also planning to take a long summer break to rest up from his Olympic feats.\n\nHe said he's \"negotiated with his coach (Bowman) and will take a month-and-a-half vacation to rejoice and travel. Prior to the Olympics, Bowman told the French sports newspaper \"L'Equipe\" that he was keen on seeing Marchand head back to the U.S. shortly after the Olympics to keep focused on preparing the next competitions rather than linger in France where he could get distracted by an eventual star-status.\n\nBut Bowman also gushed about Marchand to \"L'Equipe.\" \"It just shows the incredible work he's done for many years to get here. The way he handled it and his attitude were astonishing. (...) I kept a promise I made to a kid three years ago. He succeeded. It was not only a challenge for him, it was also an enormous challenge for me,\" said Bowman.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Or the enduring emotion of a partisan Parisian crowd. It's also because Leon Marchand managed to achieve something almost everyone thought impossible, and that he will be remembered as the defining figure of the 2024 Olympics.\n\nVictory in the 200-meter butterfly then 200-meter breaststroke on the same Wednesday evening was a feat even his coach, Bob Bowman, thought beyond the limits.\n\n\"My coach didn't really want me to do that because it was impossible to do and had never been done before,\" Marchand told DW. \"It was really big chance for me and I was really excited to do it, but I didn't know if it was possible.\"\n\nIt was a surprise even to the most decorated Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, who was also coached by Bowman. Phelps described it as \"probably the greatest double I've ever seen in the history of the sport.\"\n\nMarchand's prowess in the pool have led to comparisons with the American great, who won 23 Olympic gold medals in his career. At 22, Marchand has time to catch up, but without a relay team as strong as the United States one of Phelps' era, it's a tough ask. Nevertheless, the Toulouse native is flattered to be mentioned in the same breath.\n\n\"So proud to hear that, honestly,\" he said. \"When people compare me to Mark Spitz or Michael, those guys are legends. They changed the sport forever. I'm not comparing myself to them, I think they were way above, and everything they've done is amazing.\"\n\nThe sports-watching population of France may not agree that the two American greats are \"way above\" their new idol. But Marchand is only now beginning to realize the impact he has had on his homeland.\n\n\"I feel like it changed Paris for a week, it's been magic here. It's been successful. The Olympics have been amazing. Everyone has been watching sport and that's really rare and special for us athletes.\"\n\nThat mutual affection was never more apparent than in that breaststroke win, the second leg of that \"impossible\" double when the home crowd chanted 'Allez!'

And Salam\u00e9, whose beat is usually politics, has also been dismissed for not having enough sporting experience to host a show ostensibly focused on the Olympic Games.\n\nThat didn't stop Marchand from being greeted like a hero on Monday night, when he visited Club France, the Olympics' largest fan zone which brings together a daily average of 40,000 people and winning French athletes. The frenzied crowd that erupted into loud cheers and chants of \"Leon President\" as soon as the Olympic champ walked on stage.\n\nWhile he's not seeking a career in politics, Marchand also counts French President Emmanuel Macron among his most fervent fans. Macron was seen jumping for joy at the Paris La Defense Arena when Marchand won his fourth gold medal on Aug. 2. The French President, who saw his popularity collapse after dissolving the French National Assembly and calling snap elections shortly before the start of the Olympics, later posted a picture of him shaking Marchand's hand on X with a message saying \"Impossible isn't French! Four GOLD medals at home and a new Olympic record, it's historic. It's Leon Marchand.\n\nMarchand, who relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, three years ago, looked like a fish out of the water as he stepped under the spotlight. Speaking to hysterical fans at Club France on Monday, the athlete said, \"I don't have much to say. Guys, you were monstrous. Really. It was huge to see you in the stands. You are making the Games magical. So thank you all, truly.\"\n\nMacron does owe Marchand a great deal. The champion has largely contributed to making these Olympics a success, and switching French people's mood -- from gloomy to euphoric -- in less than 10 days. He's also helped France reach its historic record of 48 medals so far, placing the country in the third slot behind the U.S. and China.\n\nIn an interview with France Televisions' host Anne-Sophie Lapix, said \"due to (his) education,\" he is \"humble.\" \"My parents are here to remind it to me. I'm keeping my feet on the ground. I also have studies on the side,\" said Marchand, who is studying computer science at the Arizona State University.\n\nAddressing his sudden fame, he told Lapix that \"It's a big change for sure. I'm quite reserved. I prefer being at home with my parents rather than being on stage in front of 15,000 people.\"\n\n\"It's not easy for me after nine days of intense competition. I realize my new status. (...) Being in front of 15,000 is not really my comfort zone. (...) And for a photo shoot I had to wear the five medals around the neck; it's heavy!\" he said with a smile, adding that seeing supporters \"up close\" during the competition was \"a great moment.\"\n\nNicknamed \"the dolphin\" by his French supporters, Marchand moved to Arizona to train with Bob Bowman, the coach of 23-time Olympic gold medalist American swimmer Michael Phelps. He told Lapix that he prepared these Olympic Games for five years. \"This week is rewarding. It's a lot of work.\" In an interview with AFP (picked up by Le Figaro) in February, Marchand revealed he shared a house with four other swimmers about 10 minutes away from campus and woke up every day at 5 am to train starting at 6 am.\n\nWhile he's done with swimming competitions, Marchand said he will be sticking around for the finals of basket, volley ball and athletics. Marchand is also planning to take a long summer break to rest up from his Olympic feats.\n\nHe said he's \"negotiated with his coach (Bowman) and will take a month-and-a-half vacation to rejoice and travel. Prior to the Olympics, Bowman told the French sports newspaper \"L'Equipe\" that he was keen on seeing Marchand head back to the U.S. shortly after the Olympics to keep focused on preparing the next competitions rather than linger in France where he could get distracted by an eventual star-status.\n\nBut Bowman also gushed about Marchand to \"L'Equipe.\" \"It just shows the incredible work he's done for many years to get here. The way he handled it and his attitude were astonishing. (...) I kept a promise I made to a kid three years ago. He succeeded. It was not only a challenge for him, it was also an enormous challenge for me,\" said Bowman.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

In an exclusive interview with DW, he explained how he defied conventional wisdom and why he's not ready for comparisons with Michael Phelps.\n\nIt's not just the four gold medals. Or the enduring emotion of a partisan Parisian crowd. It's also because Leon Marchand managed to achieve something almost everyone thought impossible, and that he will be remembered as the defining figure of the 2024 Olympics.\n\nVictory in the 200-meter butterfly then 200-meter breaststroke on the same Wednesday evening was a feat even his coach, Bob Bowman, thought beyond the limits.\n\n\"My coach didn't really want me to do that because it was impossible to do and had never been done before,\" Marchand told DW. \"It was really big chance for me and I was really excited to do it, but I didn't know if it was possible.\"\n\nIt was a surprise even to the most decorated Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, who was also coached by Bowman. Phelps described it as \"probably the greatest double I've ever seen in the history of the sport.\"\n\nPhelps some way off, for now\n\nMarchand's prowess in the pool have led to comparisons with the American great, who won 23 Olympic gold medals in his career. At 22, Marchand has time to catch up, but without a relay team as strong as the United States one of Phelps' era, it's a tough ask. Nevertheless, the Toulouse native is flattered to be mentioned in the same breath.\n\n\"So proud to hear that, honestly,\" he said. \"When people compare me to Mark Spitz or Michael, those guys are legends. They changed the sport forever. I'm not comparing myself to them, I think they were way above, and everything they've done is amazing.\"\n\nThe sports-watching population of France may not agree that the two American greats are \"way above\" their new idol. But Marchand is only now beginning to realize the impact he has had on his homeland.\n\n\"I feel like it changed Paris for a week, it's been magic here. It's been successful. The Olympics have been amazing. Everyone has been watching sport and that's really rare and special for us athletes.\"\n\nThat mutual affection was never more apparent than in that breaststroke win, the second leg of that \"impossible\" double when the home crowd chanted 'Allez!' (Go!), every time Marchand emerged from the water to take a breath.\n\n\"It was kind of shocking at first to have 15,000 people cheering for me,\" he said. \"I had goose bumps over my entire body and I was really using that energy to swim as fast as possible. Every time I took a breath in breaststroke, it was kind of crazy.\"\n\nUS move brings confidence\n\nMarchand may have to get used to life becoming a little crazy, with such a spectacular breakout Games certain to lead to an enormous change in his profile and an increase in temptations. But the Frenchman is mostly just interested in reaching the outer edges of his talent.\n\n\"I don't know how fast I can go, or where my limits are,\" he said. \"That's why I train as hard as possible every day to get there. The thing about swimming is that it is about the time. We never know what we're going to reach and I'm just so excited and curious about it.\"\n\nIn an effort to test those limits, Marchand has spent the last three years living and training in the US, following the path of his parents, who were also Olympic swimmers.

Krajicek looked to the stands, perplexed, trying to understand why the crowd was not respecting the tradition of silence before a serve.\n\nAbout three miles north, Marchand had just won the gold in the 200-meter butterfly for France.\n\nFor some fans in Court Philippe Chatrier, watching the French swimmer on their phones was more important than watching Nadal playing what could be his last match in Paris.\n\nIt didn't just happen at the tennis venue. At the Grand Palais, the Korean and U.S. fencing teams had to pause their bout for more than a minute, waiting for the Marchand cheers to calm down. Truls Moregardh, a table tennis athlete competing for Sweden at the South Paris Arena, scratched his head and smiled in disbelief while looking at the umpire, who in return shrugged, having no clue about what was happening.\n\nAnd Marchand did it again on Friday.\n\nIn La D\u00e9fense Arena, a rugby stadium-turned Olympic swimming pool, Marchand soared to another victory in the 200 individual medley while setting a new Olympic record of 1 minute, 54.06 seconds. That gave him four individual golds at a single Olympics.\n\nFans gathered every time Marchand swims\n\nAt Club France, where a staggering 20,000 fans had gathered to witness history, when Marchand secured his fourth gold medal, the eruption of joy was overwhelming. The crowd's roar was so powerful that even the security guards momentarily abandoned their posts, captivated by the live broadcast on the giant screen.\n\n\"He is a fish! No, he is better than a fish!\" exclaimed Moussa Keita, one of the guards, to a colleague, as he joined the throng in recording the moment on his phone.\n\nAmong the sea of jubilant supporters, Lydie Roux, 36, stood in the front row, her eyes shining with admiration.\n\n\"The way he moves his body in the water is simply incredible,\" she said. \"He makes us dream.\"\n\nNear her, 19-year-old Arthur Oursel had nearly lost his voice after chanting the name of his new idol over and over:\n\n\"We love you L\u00e9on, we worship you, you are our hero!\"\n\nTheir voices were part of a chorus that echoed across Paris, transcending the boundaries of the pool and infiltrating every corner of the city. \"Leon the Megalodon.\" \"King Leon.\" \"The French Phelps.\" All are fitting nicknames for the one the man who is becoming the face of France's success during these Olympics. With 42 medals and nearly a week left, the host country has already surpassed the 33 medals France won at the last Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nMarchand's accomplishments also resonated at the highest levels of French society. After his race on Friday, he was greeted by President Emmanuel Macron, who later praised him on X.\n\n\"The impossible isn't French!\" Macron wrote in French. \"Four home gold medals and a new Olympic record -- it's historic. It's L\u00e9on Marchand.\"\n\nMarchand is an even bigger star in his hometown\n\nIn Marchand's hometown of Toulouse, in southwestern France, he could soon have a swimming pool named in honor. Vincent Gardeau, the president of the TOEC Dolphins, Marchand's former club, told The Associated Press he had plans of inaugurating the L\u00e9on Marchand Swimming Complex by 2027.\n\nHe has been a hometown hero for years. In 2022, Marchand was awarded an honorary medal by the mayor of Toulouse after winning two gold medals at the World Championships. He was just 20 years old at the time.\n\nFans are searching for Marchand souvenirs\n\nAt one of the official Olympic boutiques around Paris -- this one near the Louvre Museum, fans eagerly sought Marchand's memorabilia. On Saturday, Maryse Dumont, 77, was scanning the shelves with disappointment.\n\n\"He is the biggest star in these Olympics and they don't even have a T-shirt of him,\" Dumont said, upset that she could not find anything for her granddaughter.\n\n\"You don't even have a swimming cap?\" she asked a store clerk, before leaving empty-handed with no interest in the plain blue T-shirts of the French delegation she was pointed to.\n\nMarchand's Olympic journey in Paris ended Sunday, where he swam the breaststroke leg for France in the 4x100 medley relay. The team finished third, adding a bronze medal to his four individual golds.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType":

In an exlusive interview with DW, he explained how he defied conventional wisdom and why he's not quite ready for comparison with Michael Phelps.\n\nIt's not just the four gold medals. Or the enduring emotion of a partisan Parisian crowd. It's also because Leon Marchand managed to achieve something almost everyone thought impossible, that he will be remembered as the defining figure of the 2024 Olympics.\n\nVictory in the 200-meter butterfly then 200-meter breaststroke on the same Wednesday evening was a feat even his coach, Bob Bowman, thought beyond the limits.\n\n\"My coach didn't really want me to do that because it was impossible to do and had never been done before,\" Marchand told DW. \"It was really big chance for me and I was really excited to do it, but I didn't know if it was possible.\"\n\nIt was a surprise even to the most decorated Olympian of all time, Michael Phelps, who was also coached by Bowman. Phelps described it as \"probably the greatest double I've ever seen in the history of the sport.\"\n\nMarchand's prowess in the pool have led to comparisons with the American great, who won 23 Olympic gold medals. At 22, Marchand has time to catch up, but without a relay team as strong as the United States one of Phelps' era, it's a tough ask. Nevertheless, the Toulouse native is flattered to be mentioned in the same breath.\n\n\"So proud to hear that, honestly,\" he said. \"When people compare me to Mark Spitz or Michael, those guys are legends. They changed the sport forever. I'm not comparing myself to them, I think they were way above, and everything they've done is amazing.\"\n\nThe sports-watching population of France may not agree that the two American greats are \"way above\" their new idol. But Marchand is only now beginning to realize the impact he has had on his homeland.\n\n\"I feel like it changed Paris for a week, it's been magic here. It's been successful. The Olympics have been amazing. Everyone has been watching sport and that's really rare and special for us athletes.\"\n\nThat mutual affection was never more apparent than in that breastroke win, the second leg of that \"impossible\" double when the home crowd chanted 'Allez!' (Go!), every time Marchand emerged from the water to take a breath.\n\n\"It was kind of shocking at first to have 15,000 people cheering for me,\" he said. \"I had goosebumps over my entire body and I was really using that energy to swim as fast as possible. Every time I took a breath in breaststroke, it was kind of crazy.\"\n\nMarchand may have to get used to life becoming a little crazy, with such a spectacular breakout Games certain to lead to an enormous change in his profile and an increase in temptations. But the Frenchman is mostly just interested in reaching the outer edges of his talent.\n\n\"I don't know how fast I can go, or where my limits are,\" he said. \"That's why I train as hard as possible every day to get there. The thing about swimming is that it is about the time. We never know what we're going to reach and I'm just so excited and curious about it.\"\n\nIn an effort to test those limits, Marchand has spent the last three years living and training in the US, following the path of his parents, who were also Olympic swimmers. He is unsure whether he could have achieved what he has by staying in France but says moving stateside has undoubtedly had a significant positive impact.\n\n\"I'm really grateful for what the US brought,\" Marchand said. \"I gained a lot of confidence.

This is where a young Leon Marchand first swam. Now he has become the standout performer at his home Olympic Games.\n\nMarchand is the name on everyone's lips here, the French sensation in the blue swimming hat who has lit up Paris.\n\n\"Everyone has been watching in the bars and restaurants... when Leon swims, they stop eating and drinking and watch it unfold with their mouths open,\" Coloma adds. \"For Toulouse, it's so important what he's done. He's become a big star.\"\n\nFor Coloma, the director general of the century-old Dauphins du TOEC (Toulouse Olympique Employes Club), it's a pinch-yourself moment.\n\n\"One year ago, a journalist said to me, 'Maybe Leon will be the star in Paris'. I said, 'Of the swimming?'. And they said, 'Yeah?'. And I said, 'No, of the whole Olympic Games'.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about Leon here. When he was preparing for the Olympic Games, he came here (to) practise and when he swam, another swimmer didn't finish his training. They came out of the pool and stood on the side, watched and said, 'It's just incredible'. He was mesmerised.\n\n\"I feel like for the club it hasn't yet sunk in what Leon has achieved at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nInside the unglamorous entrance to the club, housed in rather scratchy surroundings to the south of Toulouse city centre, there's a photo on the wall of a younger Marchand and more recent front pages from French newspapers celebrating his success.\n\nThere are also references to his sporting family, with a photograph of his father, Xavier, himself an Olympic swimmer, and his achievements listed in a hall of fame that adorns one of the club walls. Marchand senior won a silver behind Marcel Wouda in the 200m individual medley at the 1998 world championships.\n\nMarchand's mother, Celine Bonnet, was also a top-level swimmer who took part in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, while his uncle Christophe swam in Barcelona and Seoul in 1988.\n\nThe humble club settings in Toulouse all feel a far cry from Marchand-mania in Paris, where he has won four gold medals, one bronze and had the 17,000-seater La Defense Arena screaming his name.\n\nAt the Stade de France, the decathlon 400m had to be delayed, as did a fencing final, because of the noise from the stands watching Marchand. The words of the French national anthem 'La Marseillaise' have been changed from 'Marchons, marchons' to 'Marchand, Marchand!'\n\nFirst, he set a new Olympic record as he dominated the 400m individual medley. He followed that up by setting new Olympic records in the men's 200m butterfly and breaststroke within the space of just a couple of hours -- the first swimmer to ever achieve this. The 200m butterfly was especially dramatic and saw him surge past world-record holder Kristof Milak, who gave a nervous look to his left as Marchand powered by in a thrilling last 50m.\n\nRoared on by a raucous French crowd shouting 'Ole' in unison every time his face popped out of the water, he broke another Olympic record and picked up his fourth gold medal in the men's 200m individual medley on Friday night.\n\n\"It does feel weird,\" Marchand said of all the attention. \"Because when I went to Tokyo (for the last Olympic Games), I was nobody. I was just a random swimmer.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't think anything went wrong this week. It was just perfect. I've really shared some incredible moments with the spectators.\"\n\nDespite everything, Marchand has remained true to his roots. That is the TOEC -- who will always welcome him back with open arms.\n\n\"It's really a family,\" he said of the TOEC in a previous interview. \"My family have always been very involved in the club, it's next door to us. I know that when I come back, I will always be very well received, that I have everything I need.\"\n\nMarchand was four years old when his parents first brought him down to swim at Alfred-Nakache, with the promise of McDonald's if he could complete a length without stopping or holding onto the edge.\n\nHis parents are credited with keeping him grounded and for letting him find his way in the sport without pushing him too much. His younger brother, Oscar, for example, enjoyed swimming competitions but not the training, so decided to play basketball instead.\n\n\"We try as hard as we can to protect him and keep him sane,\" Xavier and Celine said. \"Live like a normal family, in fact.\"\n\nMarchand didn't instantly fall for the sport that's turned him into a household name.\n\n\"When he was little, he didn't love swimming, he came because his mother and father swam,\" Coloma recalls. \"He played rugby for a bit, but later he came back and took it up properly. When he committed to it, he took off.\"\n\nNicolas Castel began training Marchand when he was a boy and remembers a shy child who was not very advanced physically. Childhood friend Remi Lacourt described Marchand to French outlet AFP as a \"shrimp\" as a boy, who only weighed around 40kg aged 11. He had a growth spurt in his mid-teens.\n\n\"He swam two or three times a week at that time (when he started), but sometimes he didn't want to come to training,\" Castel tells The Athletic.\n\n\"He was pretty good, but not exceptional either. Above all, he was happy to be with his mates. He just wanted to have a good time.\n\n\"Every year, I pushed him a bit more. He was quiet, but he listened to the coaches and was a quick learner. It was important to improve his coordination. Every time we set ourselves a goal, we achieved it. There wasn't a moment when we said to ourselves: 'This is it, this is the future Michael Phelps'. It happened gradually.\"\n\nCastel says that, aged 15, Marchand started to devote himself more to the sport, training twice a day. He began winning French championships and competitions on the international stage.\n\nAt the World Junior Championships in 2019, he won a bronze medal and set a new national record.\n\nMarchand was on the rise but, now hungry to take his swimming to the next level, still felt he needed an extra gear.\n\nIt was at this stage he reached out to Bob Bowman, the man who had coached Michael Phelps for all 28 of his Olympic medals. Marchand hoped Bowman might help train him in the U.S., away from the growing spotlight back home. Bowman, head coach at Arizona State University, wasn't aware of Marchand but knew the family name and decided to take a chance on the young Frenchman.\n\n\"I had no idea he'd be this good,\" he said.\n\nMarchand also began working with Thomas Sammut, a mental performance coach, to help cope with the feelings of stress and nervousness he was having before races.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Bowman and 6,000 miles from home, Marchand, who studied computer science and woke at 5.20am six days a week to train, really kicked on.\n\nIn Tokyo three years ago, his first Olympics, Marchand reached the final of the 400m individual medley. This gave him the confidence to go on and establish himself as the best male swimmer in the world. This Parisian summer is his moment in the sun.\n\nCommentators have spoken of Marchand's \"fifth stroke\" -- his remarkable capacity to swim with incredible strength underwater.\n\n\"His body is shaped perfectly,\" Bowman told Le Monde. \"It's like a torpedo. He has no hips. It's just like straight down.\"\n\nDespite the move to the U.S., he has remained in close contact with Castel, who has twice been to Arizona. The pair still speak at least once a week and Castel is currently in Paris supporting him.\n\n\"I'm in awe of what he's achieved,\" Castel tells The Athletic. \"He has created a strong winning mentality the more he has competed and the older he's become.\n\n\"It's incredible for Toulouse, it's really beautiful. It's wonderful for our swimming club. For everybody, it's really amazing to see what he's done at the Olympics.\"\n\nBack at Alfred-Nakache, named after the world record swimmer who was part of the TOEC -- one of only two Jewish athletes known to have competed in the Olympics after surviving the Holocaust -- there's a strong sense of pride at what Marchand has achieved.\n\nMarchand started out at the small indoor winter pool, before graduating to the Olympic pool at the complex -- which also has a huge 150m long summer pool.\n\nFormer France football goalkeeper Fabien Barthez swims at the club every morning.\n\n\"He is the pride of a city like Toulouse and the club,\" says Christophe Roussel, towelling himself down. \"It's great for swimming and for anyone who also wants to take up swimming because it is a very simple sport.\"\n\nSandra, who asked to be referred to by her first name only, agrees. The 23-year-old says: \"It shows us that with work you can achieve what you want to and even if it takes time, you will always reach your goals. Knowing that someone like Leon Marchand swam here and became what he is today... it's very inspiring. For Toulouse, it shows that even if it's not the capital of the country, it has the means and the people that want to achieve things.\"\n\n\"The fact this is the pool where Leon started... it's incredible, it's very inspiring,\" adds Laura Georgelin, 25.\n\nAlex, who has worked at the club for five years, says Marchand's feats had propelled the club into the global spotlight: \"It's a really good club in France, it's one of the best, so having that international visibility is really amazing for us. And it's great for Toulouse to have that sporty image, having also won the rugby Champions Cup this year and with Antoine Dupont (who also comes from the region, winning gold) in the rugby sevens.\"\n\nLater that day, The Athletic met up with Jean-Claude Dardelet, deputy mayor of Toulouse, in his opulent office overlooking the Place du Capitole.\n\n\"Toulouse is a booming city, vibrant, young,\" he says. \"Leon Marchand is the best possible flagship for the city that you can dream of -- with Dupont as well. They give us great pride and honour.\"\n\nAs Marchand took to the pool for the final time at the Olympic Games last night, taking bronze with his France team-mates in the 4x100m medley relay, he left the stage having been propelled into sporting stardom.\n\nYet, for France's new hero, his heart will always be in Toulouse -- and the club where it all began.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com",

For Bob Bowman, who as a teenager imagined himself conducting an orchestra and following in the footsteps of Leonard Bernstein, it's a pleasure to guide the blue soloist who joined him in August 2021 in Arizona, followed him in the spring in Texas, and is forcing him to revise his classics.\n\nYet the American is used to these triumphs. There are countless water musicians whose scores have been rewarded with titles. In Paris, Hungarian Hubert Kos won the 200 m backstroke; in Tokyo, American Chase Kalisz preceded Marchand in the 400 m medley. And if he is associated with Allison Schmitt (4 Olympic golds), Bowman will forever remain Michael Phelps' mentor, discovered when the kid was 11. Together, they wrote the history of the Games and the legend of the swimmer with twenty-three Olympic titles. What makes me most proud is that our relationship has survived his career and his wanderings,\" says the coach. We form a hybrid family; I consider his four boys to be my grandchildren, and I teach them to swim, music,construction games...\"\n\nIn recent years, he has made them his priority, spending all his late afternoons with them. And that explains why Bowman, before signing his contract with the University of Texas, discussed this project with the Phelpses. \"They understand that this is a professional choice, a unique opportunity to live in the best place in the world to teach swimming. \"My career is coming to an end, but I still want to take on challenges. And I won't stay in Austin forever. My employers know that I'm keeping my home in Arizona, that I'll be traveling there very regularly to see my loved ones.\"\n\nAmong those challenges is this kid who became a star this week. For him, Bowman merges with this Prokofiev concerto No. 3 that fascinates him, never losing sight of the metronome, refusing to become soft, but accepting to adapt to Marchand's desires and talent.\n\nBowman has never been a virtuoso. Whether at the piano or in the pool. The modest swimmer soon turned to teaching while studying psychology. In 1996, he had already spotted Phelps, a boy with an atypical physique, who would serve his ideas well. A lover of mathematics, Bowman has theorized his sport. His science of technique and biomechanics is praised, and his warm-up and cool-down protocols, as meticulous as an architect's work of art, provide inspiration. We also point out his roughness. It' s true that I don't have much room for error with him,\" Marchand grimaces. As soon as I start messing about in the water, he sets me straight. But I think that's why he's good.\"\n\nBowman can be uncompromising, admitting that he was too hard on Phelps before the 2008 Beijing Games and that unrivalled golden coaster. Bob is more of a judge of his eruptive character,\" corrects Kalisz, who was only 6 years old when he crossed his path. He doesn't realize that he intimidates young people. They think:\"Gee, Bob's mad at me. I feel obliged to disabuse them of this notion. He's just letting them know that they're not in the right. He tells them a bit firmly, it's true, but there's love in there.\" To convince them of this, Kalisz jokingly apostrophizes the coach: \"Are we going to get the Bob of 2011 back?\" A reference that wakes Bowman up. \" That Bob doesn't exist anymore,\" he grumbles.\n\nIf they're accomplices today, Bowman and Phelps almost hated each other, even parting ways angrily after the 2012 London Olympics. \"What a hell! He hadn't felt like it for months. He'd started going out, getting stoned and drinking,\" recalls Bowman, who feared the worst with every phone call. Looking back, he knows he almost broke his toy. \"For the twelve years leading up to Beijing, I was obsessed with his success and my ambition, barely sleeping, looking for what would make him go faster,\" he regrets. In the end, Phelps went off the rails. \"I saw him destroy himself. I was disappointed and angry. As parents can be. How could someone who has everything going for him act so stupidly?And then, you remember, this person who swims fast and makes a lot of money, has to deal with his flaws,\" Bowman excuses him.\n\nAfter years of wandering between depression and alcoholism, this spiritual son finally took to the water again for the Rio Games. Finally at peace. And still with his surrogate father. \"He never left me, I never kicked him out. It's a bit like being married, knowing that you can't get a divorce. We worked out our problems because we couldn't move forward separately. He always knew I'd help him,\" the technician told us in 2016.\n\nObviously, this experience shook him up and changed him profoundly. \"It took me a long time to realize that my personal happiness wasn't always at the level of my swimmers' results. The fact that Michael achieved in Beijing what no other swimmer had ever done did not resolve my innermost questions. At the time, I would have said that this success was my best memory. Today, I'm proud to have contributed to it, but I'd rather remember the journey than the destination.\n\nWhile he remains fully committed, and thanks Marchand for offering him new adventures, Bowman allows himself to experience them differently. \"Swimming is no longer the focal point of my life. I have my family, I like to travel. For me, as a lover of France, coaching L\u00e9on gives me the opportunity to spend time there, enjoy the food, learn about the culture. It forces me to remain open-minded. A vision that delights Kalisz: \"It's cool to see him like that. I don't think Bob has ever been so happy and in harmony with himself.\"", "source": {"uri": "theweek.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

'Watch some...", "body": "PARIS (AP) - L\u00e9on Marchand isn't ready to rest just yet.\n\nThe 22-year-old French swimmer who won five medals - four of them gold - is eager to soak in the Olympic atmosphere and make the most of his time in Paris.\n\n\"I\u00b4ll try to watch some sports,\" Marchand said Monday when asked about his plans. \"It\u00b4s not easy because I have to do business now. And I have a new life, so it won\u00b4t be easy to be in the stands with everyone else. But yes, I\u00b4m at the Games and I want to enjoy it.\"\n\nHe's particularly excited about catching some basketball and volleyball, as well as the track and field 200 meters finals.\n\nBut after the Games, Marchand is looking forward to some much-needed down time.\n\n\"Then I will take some vacation next week and celebrate with my family,\" he said.\n\nLeon Marchand of France, poses with his gold medal for the men's 200-meter individual medley final at the 2024 Summer Olympics, Friday, Aug. 2, 2024, in Nanterre, France. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\n\nMarchand\u00b4s name has been synonymous with success during the Summer Games. So much so that many French fans are describing him as the face of the Olympics for the host country.\n\nMarchand, who received congratulations from French President Emmanuel Macron poolside, admitted that navigating his newfound fame will be a challenge.\n\n\"This new stardom will be weird for me. This is coming down on me in less than a week,\" he said. \"I\u00b4m very reserved, I\u00b4m very shy, I\u00b4m not very good at speaking in public. I\u00b4d rather be at home with my parents than on the podium in front of 15,000 people.\"\n\nOn Monday, Marchand\u00b4s journey was celebrated at Club France in Paris, where he was greeted by the cheers of about 25,000 fans.\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nLeon Marchand from France competes in a men's 4x100-meter medley relay heat at the Summer Olympics in Nanterre, France, Saturday, Aug. 3, 2024.

That's a big reason why there's so many talented athletes across the world now.\"The U.S. certainly has its shining moments in Paris. Katie Ledecky won two more golds, moving her into a tie for second place among all athletes on the career list with nine. She also joined Phelps as the only swimmers to win the same event at four straight Summer Games with her victory in the 800 freestyle.The women's team produced several more stars, including Torri Huske (three golds, two silvers), Gretchen Walsh (two golds, two silvers) and Regan Smith (two golds, three silvers).But there were plenty of disappointments, particular on the men's side. Caeleb Dressel, a big star at the Tokyo Games with five gold medals, finished sixth in the 50 freestyle and didn't even qualify for the final of the 100 butterfly. Murphy settled for a bronze in the 100 backstroke and, like Dressel, failed to qualify for the final of his other individual event, the 200 back.In all, the American men produced only two gold medals, and they didn't pick up an individual victory until Finke's world record in the 1,500 freestyle on the final night. \"You always want to be better,\" said Anthony Nesty, head coach of the men's team. \"Yes, we want our athletes to win gold medals, but the other teams have great athletes as well. We have to go back, all the coaches in the U.S., get back on it and hopefully four years from now we have a better result. From the men, for sure.\"The depth of the American team remains its biggest strength. Even with four of its most prominent stars -- Dressel, Murphy, Lilly King and Simone Manuel -- managing only one individual medal (Murphy's bronze in the 100 back), the U.S. easily led the overall medals table with 28.Three of the four world records set at the meet came from the Americans, two of them on relays.\"Whether our athletes won a gold medal or failed to make a semifinal or whatever it might be,\" said U.S. women's coach Todd DeSorbo, \"you've got to learn from it, go back home and be better.\"\n\nThat said, claiming the top step on the Olympic medal podium is no longer a given for U.S. swimmers.\n\nVideo above: French swimmer Leon Marchand draws comparisons to Michael Phelps at Paris Olympics\n\nNine days of thrilling competition at La Defense Arena wrapped up Sunday night with the Americans barely pulling out the lead in the gold medal standings thanks to a victory in the final race.\n\nThe U.S. finished with just eight golds, its fewest since the 1988 Seoul Games and one ahead of its biggest rival, Australia.\n\nMore notably, the rest of the world totaled more victories (20) than the United States and Australia combined, the first time that's happened since the 1996 Atlanta Games.\n\nThe Americans will certainly be intent of improving their performance heading into the home games at Los Angeles in 2028, when swimming will have in its largest, most spectacular setting yet -- a temporary pool inside SoFi Stadium with a capacity for some 38,000 fans.\n\nStill, with more and more international swimmers getting their training in the U.S. -- and prominent American coaches such as Bob Bowman spreading their knowledge to other countries -- a more diverse list of gold medalists is likely to be the norm going forward.\n\n\"This sport is growing and I can't help but feel like we've been a part of that,\" American swimmer Bobby Finke said. \"It's something we should take home and be proud of.\"\n\nTwo of the biggest swimming stars in Paris, France's L\u00e9on Marchand and Canada's Summer McIntosh, train in the U.S. but won a bevy of medals for their home countries.\n\nMarchand, who captured four individual golds as well as a relay bronze, is coached by Bowman, best known as the guy who led Michael Phelps throughout his record-setting career.

Born on May 4, 1973, in Toulouse, France, Xavier specialized in the individual medley and freestyle events. He won a bronze medal at the 1998 World Championships in the 200-meter individual medley. Xavier's experience and success in the swimming world have undoubtedly influenced L\u00e9on's career and provided him with invaluable guidance.\n\nC\u00e9line Marchand, L\u00e9on's mother, has been a constant source of support for her son. Although not much information is available about her, it is evident that she plays a crucial role in L\u00e9on's life and career. C\u00e9line's unwavering support has undoubtedly contributed to L\u00e9on's success in the swimming world.\n\nArizona State University L\u00e9on Marchand decided to pursue his education in the United States, specifically at Arizona State University (ASU). He enrolled in the university in 2020 and joined the Sun Devils swimming team. This move allowed L\u00e9on to train with top-level coaches and teammates, further honing his skills and preparing for international competitions.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand had a remarkable performance at the 2024 Paris Olympics, setting multiple Olympic records and winning several gold medals. Here are the Olympic records he set:\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand's dominance in the pool was unprecedented, as he became the first French swimmer to win multiple individual gold medals at one Games. He also became one of France's most successful Olympians in history, tying the record for gold medals won by any athlete with four gold medals.\n\nA crucial aspect of L\u00e9on Marchand's success is his diet. As a professional athlete, L\u00e9on must consume a balanced diet that provides his body with the necessary nutrients to perform at its best. Although specific details about his diet are not readily available, it is safe to assume that it consists of lean proteins, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, and plenty of fruits and vegetables.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand is known for his exceptional butterfly stroke, which has helped him set records and achieve success in competitions. His training focuses on perfecting his technique, building endurance, and developing explosive power. L\u00e9on works closely with his coaches to design a training program that addresses his specific needs and goals.\n\nMichael Phelps, widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time, has expressed admiration for L\u00e9on Marchand's talent and potential. In an interview, Phelps praised L\u00e9on's dedication and work ethic, stating that he has the potential to become a dominant force in the swimming world. This endorsement from a swimming legend is a testament to L\u00e9on's skill and the impact he has made in the sport.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand is coached by Bob Bowman, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest swimming coaches in the world. Bowman, who previously coached swimming legend Michael Phelps, has been instrumental in Marchand's development and success in the pool. Under Bowman's guidance, Marchand has set numerous world and Olympic records, and has emerged as a dominant force in international swimming.\n\nL\u00e9on Marchand's journey from Toulouse, France, to becoming a rising star in the swimming world is a testament to his talent, dedication, and the support he has received from his parents, coaches, and fellow athletes. With his impressive performances, Olympic records, and admiration from Michael Phelps, L\u00e9on is poised to make a lasting impact on the sport of swimming and inspire future generations of swimmers.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "felix_yim@bbntimes.com", "name": "Felix Yim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9on_Marchand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9on Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Marchand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FINA_World_Aquatics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FINA World Aquatics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbohydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bowman_(coach)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Bowman (coach)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Meet_Xavier_Marchand_and_Ce\u0301line_Marchand__The_Parents_of_Olympic_Swimming_Legend_Le\u0301on_Marchand.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792513", "eventUri": "eng-9792513", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2002-05-17", "textStart": 153, "textEnd": 165}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Grace is a regular contributor to WRAL TechWire where she pens the insightful Happiness & Leadership@Work column.\n\nCoach Bob Bowman made a name for himself after he discovered and developed Michael Phelps into the swimming phenom who stepped onto the Olympic podium a record 28 times. Over the past five Summer Games, Team USA has captured 67 gold swim medals. Bowman is the common denominator for many of these.\n\nHis newest medalist, L\u00e9on Marchand, coached by Bowman collegiately, represents France and became the first swimmer in nearly half a century to win two gold medals in a single evening, doing so within a span of only 90 minutes.\n\nAfter Marchand returned from the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, without a medal and a time in the 400 IM that was a full second shorter than his lifetime best, he decided to seek out two allies.\n\n\u25cf The first was hiring Thomas Sammut, a mental performance coach, who helped free him from his fear of failure before big races. \"The first thing I worked on with my mental coach was managing my stress and nervousness before competitions because when I was really nervous, I couldn't swim well at all,\" said Marchand, who turned pro after leading the Arizona State men to their first-ever NCAA title. \"So I've been working on that, trying to be as relaxed as possible before and during competitions.\"\n\n\u25cf The second outreach was a cold email to a coach he thought might be able to guide him to the top. Recognizing his surname, since Leon's father was a silver medalist in the 1998 World Championships in Australia, Bowman agreed to meet.\n\nChasing Bob Bowman might be viewed as the obvious move. Thanks to the growing awareness of the importance of taking care of mental health, and athletes like Simone Biles and Michael Phelps sharing openly, Marchand also saw the importance of figuring out and protecting his mental game. He worried that competing at the highest levels would cause a constant fear of poor performance. Sammut showed him there was another way.\n\nBreathing. If you watched Marchand very carefully in the less than 2 hours between his two gold performances on July 31, you may have noticed he was doing a lot of breathing. He knew he had to manage his energy carefully.\n\nLearning breathing techniques, closing his eyes and thinking about his race and a few encouraging words have really helped him manage his energy for competition. Breathing redirects mental chatter and the calming effects provide greater oxygenation. Several commentators said that the gymnasts were forgetting to breathe on the balance beam, which made mistakes more likely.\n\nPursue enjoying the journey versus race results. Instead of swimming in pursuit of results, absorbing yourself in the here and now will increase wellness and happiness which research shows is necessary for successful human performance. The vast majority of our lives are spent on the journey, not on reaching the top, so focusing on enjoying the journey should be what life is all about.\n\nTime and time again, reaching the top can bring disappointment. Michael Phelps went through a period of depression and reported having suicidal thoughts after winning all his gold medals, and he no longer had his regimented schedule of training to attend to each day. Phelps and Biles coming out and sharing their mental health struggles has not only benefited other elite athletes, but normalized the challenges that a growing percentage of us face. Breathwork, something of a buzzword at the Games, helps still the mind and the body in moments of high stress and exertion. This tool is accessible to all of us.\n\nComparison is the thief of joy. Sammut helped Marchand know that his path and style did not have to be just like Michael Phelps. While you can learn the habits and practices of those you admire, your success will have its own interpretation. When Marchand was struggling with his warm-up practices, Bowman taught him Phelps's warm routine which Marchand has practiced ever since. Learn from the best and commit to playing your own game.\n\nAfter Marchand's historic 200M butterfly and 200M breaststroke on the same evening, a double that no one else in history has completed, Phelps exclaimed, \"That's probably the greatest double I've ever seen in the history of the sport....To be able to go 1:52 and 2:05, the kid can obviously swim, we know that, and if we didn't know it before, he's gonna be here for a long time. He's gonna make a lot of noise.\"\n\nNext up: Visualization - what Olympians like Simone Biles practice to put top scores on the board.\n\nAbout Grace Ueng\n\nGrace is CEO of Savvy Growth, a management and marketing consultancy dedicated to helping leaders and their companies realize their fullest potential.

But the international impact of America's best swim coach was a major factor in these Paris Olympics, and it hints at some of the challenges the U.S. will face in trying to reassert its dominance by 2028 when the Summer Games come to Los Angeles.\n\nBowman coached French superstar L\u00e9on Marchand to four gold medals and one bronze; Hungarian Hubert K\u00f3s to one gold; and American Regan Smith to two relay golds and three individual silver medals. His influence was everywhere, and that will continue and perhaps expand. Marchand and K\u00f3s are theoretically heading into their peak years in the sport, and more elite international talent could be headed to train with Bowman at Texas after this five-ring flex.\n\nIf Bowman stays committed to coaching Marchand -- who could increase his program of individual events to a Phelps-ian five in the future -- he figures to be unavailable to be the U.S. men's Olympic coach again in 2028. And given his new employment at Texas, he also figures to be unavailable for a job that could, and should, come open with USA Swimming: national team manager.\n\nThe national team manager oversees the competitive aspect of USA Swimming, specifically athlete and coach development at the elite level. Although most swimmer development occurs at the local levels with hundreds of club and university teams, it all has to come together at the national level in a way that maximizes the available talent. And after two straight years of underwhelming results on the international stage, it's time for some turnover.\n\nSome in the sport already were calling for changes in USA Swimming leadership last year after being whipped by Australia at the world championships. Instead the group largely decided to stand pat, whistling past the graveyard to a degree, then walking into a Paris ambush. While the results were better in the Olympics than last year at worlds, Team USA's eight golds were its fewest since 1988, and its 28 total medals the fewest since 2004.\n\nLindsay Mintenko has been the national team manager since 2017, maintaining an extremely low profile. She never made an appearance to discuss the makeup of the U.S. team at Olympic trials, and she left men's head coach Anthony Nesty and women's coach Todd DeSorbo to face the media by themselves here in Paris. If a change is made, Bowman would be an ideal candidate for the job -- except for the above reasons why he wouldn't take it. (It's also worth noting that the contract of USA Swimming CEO Tim Hinchey is up for renewal in 2025.)\n\nThe need for domestic improvement is underscored by the fact that the world is brimming with prodigious talent. In addition to the usual strong swimming countries such as Australia, China (one way or another), Great Britain and Italy, others are rising. Look no further than Ireland, which won three swimming medals.\n\nPrior to Paris, the Irish had medaled only once in Olympic swimming, in 1996. Michelle Smith claimed three gold medals and a bronze in a highly dubious performance that was further sullied by her subsequent four-year ban in '98 for a tainted urine sample. Now here came the Irish, with distance freestyler Daniel Wiffen claiming a gold and a bronze and breastroker Mona McSharry (via the University of Tennessee) winning a bronze.\n\nIrish backstroker Shane Ryan grew up in Philadelphia and swam collegiately at Penn State. He's now near the end of his swimming career, and he's seen the growth in commitment Ireland has made. The Irish aren't the only ones.\n\nAmong the international contingent, many of the swimmers who racked up multiple medals in Paris were young enough to keep improving for Los Angeles. Marchand is 22, as is German gold medalist Lukas M\u00e4rtens. K\u00f3s is 21. Chinese world-record holder Pan Zhanle turned 20 Sunday. Romanian gold medalist David Popovici is 19. On the women's side, Canadian triple gold medalist Summer McIntosh is all of 17. Australian gold winner Mollie O'Callaghan is 20.\n\nOf that group, Marchand, McIntosh and K\u00f3s all spend most of the year working out in the United States. That includes long stints of altitude training at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. While foreign athletes have flocked to the U.S. for years to hone their craft, it might be unprecedented to have the two best swimmers in the world simultaneously training in America to beat Americans.\n\nMarchand and K\u00f3s aren't the only international NCAA swimmers who won medals in Paris. At least five other current or former American collegians earned medals for other countries. You won't find any U.S. swimmers or coaches who support excluding international athletes from coming to America to be their best -- but it does increase the level of competition, and that shows no sign of abating. Swimcloud.com ranks college recruits based on their times, and the incoming class of 2024 shows the usual international influx: Top swimmers from Canada, England, France, Israel and so on will all be arriving on American campuses soon.\n\nThis comes at a time when overall opportunities in American college swimming are decreasing as the sport -- particularly on the men's side -- could face significant cuts in coming years. With the settlement of the House v. NCAA and other court cases that will put billions of dollars in the pockets of athletes over the next decade, the budget crunch is real for many university athletic departments. They will largely target men's Olympic sports -- swimming very much included.\n\nThat is a compounding concern after a weak showing by the American men in Paris. They won just two gold medals, and just one in an individual event. It would be one thing to blame it on the presence of a generational talent like Marchand, but here's the reality: If he didn't exist, none of the four races he won would have defaulted to Americans. They would have been won by Japan (400 individual medley), Great Britain (200 IM), Australia (200 breastroke) and Hungary (200 butterfly). McIntosh, on the other hand, defeated American women in all three of her gold-medal races.\n\nDespite all that, there are reasons for optimism as well. Even on the men's side, where the team was caught in something of a generational gap -- some of the older swimmers weren't able to hit the high notes they did in the past, and many of the younger ones weren't ready to be stars.\n\nFifteen of the 26 American men were competing in their first Olympics, compared to just seven out of 20 women. Of those 15, just two earned individual medals -- Luke Hobson in the 200 freestyle and Carson Foster in the 200 IM. If what happened with the American women is any indicator, the experience gained by a young squad should be valuable over the next four years.\n\nThree of the biggest U.S. female stars competed in Tokyo in 2021 and came back for much bigger roles in '24. Kate Douglass went from a single bronze medal in Tokyo to four medals in Paris -- two gold and two silver. Torri Huske similarly rose up with three golds and two silvers, and Smith had two golds and three silvers.\n\nSo there are challenges ahead, but also reasons for optimism. If the American swimmers get the best leadership, put in the work in the pool and gain inspiration at home the way the French team did here, expect a strong bounce-back in Los Angeles.", "source":

This year, that athlete is L\u00e9on Marchand, the 22-year-old French prodigy who has captivated home audiences with his record-breaking feats in the pool.\n\nHowever, Marchand's triumphs were briefly overshadowed by a moment of controversy, when the swimmer was seen on video ignoring a friendly gesture from a Chinese coach. The incident has sparked discussion online, with some criticising Marchand for his apparent lack of sportsmanship.\n\nThe flashpoint occurred on the evening of August 2nd, after Marchand had won gold in the men's 200m individual medley. As the Frenchman was walking past the Chinese team's rest area, video footage showed Chinese coach Zhu Zhigen reaching out to shake Marchand's hand. However, Marchand appeared to deliberately avoid the interaction, simply walking past Zhu without acknowledging him.\n\nThe brief incident was quickly circulated on Chinese social media, with many users lambasting Marchand's behaviour as \"arrogant\" and \"disrespectful\". Zhu Zhigen is the coach of Chinese swimmer Wang Shun, who won bronze in the same 200m individual medley event.\n\nTo his credit, Marchand sought to make amends the following morning. According to reports, the Frenchman went to the Chinese team's area in an attempt to apologise to Zhu, but the coach was not present at the time. Undeterred, Marchand returned a day later, on August 4th, and was finally able to speak with Zhu.\n\nFootage from this second interaction showed a very different scene, with Marchand and Zhu shaking hands warmly and even exchanging gifts. Marchand presented Zhu with a plush toy of the Paris 2024 Olympic mascot, while the Chinese team gifted Marchand a panda figurine in return.\n\nThe reconciliation appears to have been well-received, with both parties downplaying the initial incident. Marchand explained that he had simply been focused on his own post-race obligations and had not intentionally snubbed Zhu. For his part, the Chinese coach accepted the apology and praised Marchand's sportsmanship in making the effort to make amends.\n\nThe young French swimmer has already etched his name in Olympic history, becoming the first man to win four individual gold medals at a single Games since Michael Phelps in 2008. His dominance in events like the 200m breaststroke, 200m butterfly and 400m individual medley has made him a national hero in France, with President Emmanuel Macron even attending to witness Marchand's triumphs.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9on_Marchand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9on Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Shun", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wang Shun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2010_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Men's_200_metre_butterfly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 200 metre butterfly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffed_toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuffed toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mascot"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Freestyle", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Freestyle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05232507/Le%CC%81on-Marchand.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792513", "eventUri": "eng-9792513", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 652, "textEnd": 662}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 1519, "textEnd": 1529}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

A record unmatched in France.\n\nWhen L\u00e9on Marchand dives in, France holds its breath.\n\nThe 22-year-old French swimmer won four gold medals and a bronze medal in the team events at the Olympic Games. A record unequalled in France.\n\n\"I haven't realised how much I've done yet. I know what I've done in the water, I know what I've done in terms of performance. I've also got a lot of statistics. There's no Frenchman who's ever done that before,\" said the swimmer in an interview with journalist Anne-Sophie Lapix.\n\nIn the stands, in the fan zones and behind the screens, the extraordinary performances of the four-time Olympic champion gave rise to scenes of jubilation.\n\nAt Club France, where a staggering 20,000 fans had gathered to witness history, when Marchand secured his fourth gold medal, the eruption of joy was overwhelming.\n\nThe crowd's roar was so powerful that even the security guards momentarily abandoned their posts, captivated by the live broadcast on the giant screen.\n\n\"He is a fish! No, he is better than a fish!\" exclaimed Moussa Keita, one of the guards, to a colleague, as he joined the throng in recording the moment on his phone.\n\nOther events were interrupted during his races as the public cheered him on from a distance, their eyes glued to their screens.\n\nThe swimmer, for his part, insists that he has remained in his bubble and not been fazed by the new found fame.\n\n\"I had a lot of races so it really allowed me to stay focused on recovering, trying to get as much sleep as possible and simply being ready the next day\" Marchand said.\n\n\"I did fourteen races in all, so I was really focused. I was in my bubble and I'm not afraid to come out of it,\" the french sensation says.\n\nAfter the Tokyo Olympics, Leon joined coach Bob Bowman and former mentor to Michael Phelps, in Arizona. Since then, his legendary strokes and exceptional recovery abilities have improved and are now being applauded.\n\n\"I want to say thank you dad mum. It's incredible but my body regenerates very quickly. So it's also because I've worked really hard and when I recover, I don't swim slowly. I swim very fast at a fairly high pace to reduce my lactate\", explains Leon.\n\nMarchand's accomplishments have resonated at the highest levels of French society. After his race on Friday, he was greeted by President Emmanuel Macron, who later praised him on X.\n\n\"The impossible isn't French!\" Macron wrote in French. \"Four home gold medals and a new Olympic record -- it's historic. It's L\u00e9on Marchand.\"\n\nMarchand's Olympic journey in Paris ended Sunday, where he swam the breaststroke leg for France in the 4x100 medley relay. The team finished third, adding a bronze medal to his four individual golds.\n\nAfter the excitement of the Paris Olympics, the French swimming prodigy says he plans to go on holiday. Shortly after, he'd be back in the pool, with his sights set on the Los Angeles 2028 games.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9on_Marchand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9on Marchand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaststroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breaststroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medley_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medley swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bowman_(coach)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Bowman (coach)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Macron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Phelps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Phelps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/63/32/80/1200x675_cmsv2_50aa1f3e-6b4a-5c20-bc38-d6f3c17bf344-8633280.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792513", "eventUri": "eng-9792513", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Asked to stop for a question, she replied \"nope\" and kept on going.\n\nThe United States went into the next-to-last day of the competition with 21 medals but only four golds, a performance that has fallen short of expectations for the world's dominant swim nation.\n\nSeveral high-profile swimmers have failed to even make the finals in some of their best events.\n\nCaeleb Dressel, a star of the Tokyo Olympics with five gold medals, was knocked out in the semis of the 100 butterfly and broke down in tears after leaving the deck.\n\nRyan Murphy, a longtime stalwart in the backstroke, managed a bronze in the 100 back and was knocked out in the semis of the 200 -- far short of his goal to reclaim the titles he swept at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games.\n\nManuel came up short, too, in her comeback from overtraining syndrome, which plagued her preparations for the Tokyo Olympics. She won a silver in the 50 freestyle at the 2016 Rio Games, to go along with her historic gold in the 100 free.\n\nThe Americans are intent of finishing strong, with several events they are favored to win over the last two days. But it's shaping up to be their lowest gold-medal total since they were limited to eight at the 1988 Seoul Games, which were led by an East German team that was later revealed to have a massive, state-sponsored doping operation.\n\n\"I think there's a bit of realization of just how much the world has caught up,\" said American swimmer Bobby Finke. \"We're still doing the best we can and we're still swimming fast.\"\n\nMarchand returns for medley relay\n\nAs if he hasn't done enough already, L\u00e9on Marchand returned to the pool to lead France to the top qualifying time in the men's 4x100 medley relay.\n\nSwimming the breaststroke leg, Marchand helped the French finish in 3 minutes, 31.36 seconds. He was joined on the team by Yohann Ndoye-Brouard, Clement Secchi and Rafael Fente-Damers.\n\nIn the final Sunday, it will be a struggle for Marchand to add another gold to the four individual victories he already has. The United States has won the event at every Olympics except the boycotted 1980 Games since it was added to the program in 1960.\n\nThe Americans qualified third in the heats at 3:31.62.\n\n\"I think it's the last (event) of the Olympic Games in France at home, so it's going to be crazy,\" Marchand said in French. \"I think we're going to enjoy it.\"\n\nComing off his win in the 200 individual medley, he conceded, \"It was hard to get up this morning. I didn't sleep very well, obviously. I'm a little tired.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

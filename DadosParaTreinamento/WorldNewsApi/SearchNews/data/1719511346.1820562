{"id": 223780144, "title": "'Furiosa' and 'Garfield' lead low Memorial Day weekend box office", "text": "Movie theaters are looking more and more like wastelands these days. Neither \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d nor \u201cThe Garfield Movie \u201d could save Memorial Day weekend, which is cruising toward a two-decade low. \u201cFuriosa,\u201d the Mad Max prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed the first place spot for the Friday-Sunday weekend with $25.6 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Warner Bros. is waiting until Monday to release its four-day estimates. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d animated and family-friendly, was the other big new offering this weekend from Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures and Alcon Entertainment. It is claiming No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with an estimated $31.9 million in ticket sales through Memorial Day. Sony estimates its three-day earnings to be $24.8 million. Aside from Memorial Day 2020, when theaters were closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, these are the lowest-earning No. 1 movies in 29 years, since \u201cCasper\u201d earned $22.5 million (not adjusted for inflation) in its first four days in 1995. Big earners are more typical for the holiday weekend, which has had 10 movies crack $100 million, led by \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u2019s\u201d record-setting $160 million launch in 2022. Last year, the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d joined the group with a $118-million debut. Audiences even turned out in greater numbers over the pandemic-addled weekend in 2021 for \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d which made more than $57 million. \u201cFuriosa,\u201d which Warner Bros. released on 3,804 screens in the U.S. and Canada, was never expected to join the $100-million opener club. But it was supposed to have a slightly stronger showing in the $40-million range over its first four days. That would have been more in line with its predecessor, \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d which opened to $45.4 million in May 2015. \u201cFury Road,\u201d starring Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, went on to gross nearly $380 million worldwide. This new origin story in which Taylor-Joy plays a younger version of Theron\u2019s character had a lot of things going for it too, including strong reviews out of the just-wrapped Cannes Film Festival (it has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes) and a splashy international press tour with many buzzy premiere looks from Taylor-Joy. With a reported $168-million production budget, not accounting for marketing and promotion, \u201cFuriosa\u201d has a long road to profitability. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d meanwhile, was more modestly budgeted, at a reported $60 million. Chris Pratt voices the lasagna-loving, Monday-hating orange cat in the movie that got scathing reviews from critics (it has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences meanwhile gave both \u201cFuriosa\u201d and \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d a B-plus CinemaScore and 4.5 stars out of 5 on PostTrak. In its second weekend, John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cIf\u201d fell 53%, adding $16 million through Sunday and $20.7 million through Monday, bringing its domestic total to $63.3 million. Worldwide, it has surpassed $100 million. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d now in its third weekend, added $13.4 million through Sunday, bringing its global total to $294.8 million, making it the fourth-highest grossing film of the year. Last week, the industry trade the Hollywood Reporter asked, \u201cWhat happened to the $100 million opener?\u201d Notably, 2024 has had none yet. The biggest of the year has been \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d which opened to $82.5 million in March and went on to earn more than $711 million worldwide. The lack of a recent runaway hit just puts more pressure on upcoming movies to make up the slack. Still on the way are a slew of potential blockbusters like Paramount\u2019s \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d (June 27), Universal\u2019s \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d (July 3) and \u201cTwisters \u201d (July 19) and two heavy-hitters from Disney: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d (June 14) and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine \u201d (July 26).", "summary": "\u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga,\u201d starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed first place through Sunday with $25.6 million, but it is neck-and-neck with \"The Garfield Movie\" in Monday projections.", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2024-05-26/furiosa-mad-max-saga-garfield-movie-memorial-day-box-office", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64ddb59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4296x2255+0+29/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fdc%2F440a2fa6422893193819cd6c9864%2Ffuriosa-taylor-joy.jp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:04:49", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.214}

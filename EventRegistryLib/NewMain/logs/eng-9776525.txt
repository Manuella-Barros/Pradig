The Court added that Israel's legislation and measures violate the international prohibition on racial segregation and apartheid. The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people.\n\n\"The advisory opinion reaffirms peremptory norms prohibiting annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid, and should be seen as declaratory in nature and binding on Israel and all States supporting the occupation,\" the experts said.\n\nThey highlighted the fact that the Court refuted the notion that Palestinian self-determination must be achieved solely through bilateral negotiations with Israel - a requirement that has subjected Palestinians to violence, dispossession and rights violations for 30 years.\n\n\"The Court has finally reaffirmed a principle that seemed unclear, even to the United Nations: Freedom from foreign military occupation, racial segregation and apartheid is absolutely non-negotiable,\" the experts said.\n\nThey welcomed the Court's recognition that converting occupation into annexation by demolishing homes, denying housing permits, and land grabs, violates the jus cogens norm prohibiting the use of force to annex occupied territory.\n\n\"May this historic ruling begin the realisation of the Palestinian people's fundamental right to self-determination, and peace premised on freedom for all,\" the experts said. The ICJ advisory opinion will serve as a critical tool to restore respect for international law, especially at this crucial moment when the Court is also considering Israel's alleged violations of the Genocide Convention, they added.\n\nThe experts recalled that the opinion was delivered 20 years after the same Court ruled on the illegality of Israel's wall, an authoritative ruling that was largely disregarded by Israel and UN Member States, allowing impunity to reign.\n\n\"Since the Court ruling on 19 July, Israel has intensified attacks on the civilian population in Gaza and their natural resources,\" they warned.\n\n\"Israel must comply with this advisory opinion, and other ICJ orders issued this year,\" they said. \"Israel must stop acting as if uniquely above the law.\"\n\n\"While

Palestinians, and targeted sanctions, including asset freezes, on Israeli individuals and entities involved in illegal occupation and racial segregation and apartheid policies.\n\nThey further called for investigations and prosecutions against those involved in crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory, particularly dual citizens serving in Israel's military or involved in settler violence.\n\n\"The Court's findings should also be widely disseminated to ensure that the illegality of Israel's presence in the occupied territory is fully understood at all levels of the government and reflected in public documents and education systems.\"\n\n\"Laws and policies that penalise opposition to or impede advocacy against Israel's occupation and apartheid must be rescinded,\" the experts said.\n\nEncouraging States to engage with the International Criminal Court, the experts called for a protective presence for Palestinians and demanded access for independent experts and mechanisms to the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nThey also called on the international community to challenge Israel's deliberate efforts to rewrite the rules of international humanitarian law, using it as \"humanitarian camouflage\" to legitimise potentially genocidal violence against all Palestinians.\n\n\"For too long, Palestinians have been held hostage to realpolitik, while Israel has

The ICJ mandated Israel to end its occupation, dismantle its settlements, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims and facilitate the return of displaced people.\n\n\"The advisory opinion reaffirms peremptory norms prohibiting annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid, and should be seen as declaratory in nature and binding on Israel and all States supporting the occupation,\" the experts said.\n\nThe Court refuted the notion that Palestinian self-determination must be achieved solely through bilateral negotiations with Israel - a requirement that has subjected Palestinians to violence, dispossession and rights violations for 30 years.\n\n\"The Court has finally reaffirmed a principle that seemed unclear, even to the United Nations: Freedom from foreign military occupation, racial segregation and apartheid is absolutely non-negotiable,\" the experts said.\n\nThey welcomed the Court's recognition that converting occupation into annexation by demolishing homes, denying housing permits, and land grabs, violates the jus cogens norm prohibiting the use of force to annex occupied territory.\n\n\"May this historic ruling begin the realisation of the Palestinian people's fundamental right to self-determination, and peace premised on freedom for all,\" the experts said. The ICJ advisory opinion will serve as a critical tool to restore respect for international law, especially at this crucial moment when the Court is also considering Israel's alleged violations of the Genocide Convention, they added.\n\nThe experts recalled that the opinion was delivered 20 years after the same Court ruled on the illegality of Israel's wall, an authoritative ruling that was largely disregarded by Israel and UN Member States, allowing impunity to reign.\n\n\"Since the Court ruling on 19 July, Israel has intensified attacks on the civilian population in Gaza and their natural resources,\" they warned.\n\n\"Israel must comply with this advisory opinion, and other ICJ orders issued this year,\" they said. \"Israel must stop acting as if uniquely above the law.\n\n\"While the

using it as \"humanitarian camouflage\" to legitimise potentially genocidal violence against all Palestinians.\n\n\"For too long, Palestinians have been held hostage to realpolitik, while Israel has

It was responding to a request by the UN General Assembly for an advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.\n\n\"The advisory opinion reaffirms peremptory norms prohibiting annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid, and should be seen as declaratory in nature and binding on Israel and all States supporting the occupation,\" the experts said.\n\nFurthermore, the Court refuted the notion that Palestinian self-determination must be achieved solely through bilateral negotiations with Israel, they added, noting that this requirement has subjected Palestinians to violence, dispossession and rights violations for 30 years.\n\n\"The Court has finally reaffirmed a principle that seemed unclear, even to the United Nations: Freedom from foreign military occupation, racial segregation and apartheid is absolutely non-negotiable,\" the experts said.\n\nThey also welcomed the Court's recognition that converting occupation into annexation by demolishing homes, denying housing permits, and land grabs, violates preemptory norms prohibiting the use of force to annex occupied territory.\n\n\"May this historic ruling begin the realisation of the Palestinian people's fundamental right to self-determination, and peace premised on freedom for all,\" they said.\n\nThe advisory opinion \"will serve as a critical tool to restore respect for international law, especially at this crucial moment when the Court is also considering Israel's alleged violations of the Genocide Convention,\" they added.\n\nThey recalled that it came 20 years after another ICJ advisory opinion on the illegality of Israel's construction of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory - an \"authoritative ruling\" which Israel and UN Member States largely disregarded, they said, thus \"allowing impunity to reign\".\n\nThey warned that Israel has intensified attacks on both civilians and resources in Gaza since the 19 July ruling.\n\n\"Israel must comply with this advisory opinion, and other ICJ orders issued this year,\" they said. \"Israel must stop acting as if uniquely above the law.\"\n\nThe rights experts added that \"while the UN Security Council and General Assembly will consider strategies to ensure a swift end to the illegal occupation...States must immediately review all diplomatic, political, and economic ties with Israel, inclusive of business and finance, pension funds, academia and charities.\"\n\nThey called for action, including an arms embargo and targeted sanctions, as well as investigations and prosecutions against those involved in crimes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly dual citizens serving in the Israeli military or involved in settler violence.\n\n\"The Court's findings should also be widely disseminated to ensure that the illegality of Israel's presence in the occupied territory is fully understood at all levels of the government and reflected in public documents and education systems,\" they said.\n\n\"Laws and policies that penalise opposition to or impede advocacy against Israel's occupation and apartheid must be rescinded.\"\n\nThe experts who issued the statement were all appointed by the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and form part of the body's Special Procedures.\n\nThe Special Rapporteurs and members of UN Working Groups are mandated by the Human Rights Council to monitor and report on specific human rights situations or thematic issues.\n\nThey serve in their individual capacity; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [],

"body": "The United Nations' largest body of independent human rights experts on Tuesday said Israel is compelled to comply with a recent International Court of Justice ruling that said its \"unlawful\" military occupation of Palestinian territories in Gaza and the West Bank must come to a rapid end.\n\nThe group of 39 special rapporteurs and members of various working groups, which collectively help form what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council, hailed the July 19 ruling by the ICJ as \"historic\" -- and one that should bolster the prospects for the end of Israel's military control of the occupied territories and strengthen international law more broadly.\n\nThe advisory opinion of the ICJ, said the experts in a statement, \"reaffirms peremptory norms prohibiting annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid, and should be seen as declaratory in nature and binding on Israel and all States supporting the occupation.\"\n\n\"Israel must comply with this advisory opinion, and other ICJ orders issued this year,\" the experts added. \"Israel must stop acting as if uniquely above the law.\"\n\n\"May the ICJ advisory opinion be the catalyst for renewed international action to restore and preserve an international order premised on respect for international law.\"\n\nNotably, the experts said, the ICJ ruling dismissed the idea that self-determination for the Palestinian people \"must be achieved solely through bilateral negotiations with Israel -- a requirement that has subjected Palestinians to violence, dispossession and rights violations for 30 years,\" since the Oslo Accords.\n\n\"The Court has finally reaffirmed a principle that seemed unclear, even to the United Nations: Freedom from foreign military occupation,

months of bombing and a ground incursion -- the death toll, annexation of land, and systematic attack on human rights have all escalated in the West Bank as well.\n\nThe experts said that given the ICJ's examination of whether or not Israel has violated the Genocide Convention -- and amidst widespread concern over war crimes and other violations perpetrated by Israeli officials, commanders, and soldiers in the field -- the nation's global allies must \"challenge Israel's deliberate efforts to rewrite the rules of international humanitarian law, using it as 'humanitarian camouflage' to legitimize potentially genocidal violence against all Palestinians.\"\n\n\"For too long, Palestinians have been held hostage to realpolitik, while Israel has made a mockery of international order and

The ICJ held that Israel's continued occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) is a violation of international law and that Israel must withdraw from the OPT as rapidly as possible. In many ways, this verdict is a sequel to the decision rendered by the ICJ in 2004 in the famous Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestine Territory (the Wall) case. In this case, the ICJ had opined that Israel's construction of a wall on Palestinian soil cutting through Palestinian communities violated international law.\n\nThe present case can be called the Wall Plus decision, as international lawyer Marko Milanovic puts it. This case is due to the United Nations General Assembly invoking ICJ's advisory jurisdiction in January 2023 and seeking its opinion on two questions: What are the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement, and annexation of Palestinian territory occupied since 1967? And, how do the policies and practices of Israel affect the legal status of the occupation, and what are the legal consequences that arise for all States and the UN from this status?\n\nIn answering these questions, as an essential starting point, the ICJ held that the decisive criterion to determine if a territory is occupied under international law is whether the occupier exercises effective control, not just physical military presence. In 2004, Israel undertook unilateral disengagement by withdrawing its army from the Gaza Strip. Yet, the ICJ held that Israel continues to exercise effective control over the Gaza Strip and thus has obligations under the law of occupation.\n\nAccordingly, the ICJ found that Israel, as the occupier, is bound by international human rights law (IHRL) in the OPT. A core component of IHRL is non-discrimination. The ICJ held that Israel's actions as an occupying power to treat Palestinian people differently without any justification based on reasonable and objective criteria is discriminatory and a violation of IHRL. Specifically, Israel's actions of a near-complete separation between the settlers and the Palestinian communities in the West Bank and East Jerusalem violate Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid. Despite this finding, intriguingly, the court did not use the term 'apartheid' and did not call Israel an 'apartheid State'. The ICJ also declared illegal Israel's settlement policies, such as the transfer of its civilian population to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, exploitation of Palestine's natural resources, forced displacement of the Palestine population, and violence against Palestinians.\n\nOn the question of annexation of the OPT, the court held that under the law of occupation, the occupying power must exercise temporary control over the occupied territory. However, Israel's conduct in the OPT, such as maintenance of settlements and construction activities, over the years, demonstrates its assertion of permanent control over the occupied territory. This amounts to annexation and violates the cardinal principle of international law of non-acquisition of territory using force. Moreover, the prolonged effect of Israel's unlawful actions accentuates the violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\n\nThe ICJ held that Israel's abuse of its position as an occupying power and continued frustration with the Palestinian people's right to self-determination triggers international responsibility. Thus, Israel is under an obligation to end its occupation as soon as possible. It must also provide full reparation, including returning land and seized immovable property since its occupation in 1967.\n\nAnother critical dimension of the case is the legal consequences for third States. The ICJ held that all countries are obliged not to recognise as legal the situation arising from Israel's unlawful presence in the OPT. They should not render aid or assistance to Israel that helps it maintain its illegal presence in the OPT. One hopes the US and the other West European nations read this.\n\nThough ICJ's advisory opinions are not binding, they carry great legal and moral weight. Moreover, one should not lose sight of the larger global context in which this decision has been rendered. Israel and its leadership are already battling various court cases and are under incessant attack for violating international law. While no one accepts that Israel will put an end to its unlawful occupation of the OPT or even halt its ongoing military offensive, this case indeed adds to the already momentous pressure on Israel to comply with its international law obligations.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_human_rights_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International human rights law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Convention_on_the_Elimination_of_All_Forms_of_Racial_Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli disengagement from Gaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/31/1600x900/This-photograph-shows-a-general-view-of-the-courtr_1722438712771.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776525", "eventUri": "eng-9776525", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It has armed them with incontrovertible legal foundations and arguments that strengthen their advocacy of the Palestinian cause and fortify their resolve to keep up the fight for justice for the Palestinian people.\n\nThe ICJ opinion affirms unequivocally that the question of Palestine is about an unlawful occupation of a territory. It refutes all the Israeli claims and arguments that sought to detach the Palestinian cause from its true context and to portray the problem as a conflict between disputant parties over disputed territory.\n\nIt makes it clear that this is a conflict between an unlawful occupier and an occupied people. It leaves no doubt that Gaza, despite Israel's unilateral withdrawal in 2005, is still under occupation. It additionally denies claims that the Oslo Accords have somehow altered the status of the Palestinian Territories as occupied territories. The judges ruled that the Oslo Accords do not detract from Israel's obligations under international law towards the Occupied Palestinian Territories and people.\n\nCrucially, the 14-member panel of international judges underscored the illegality and the danger of the protracted nature of the Israeli occupation, which inherently flies in the face of the international legal definition of occupation as a temporary measure. Israel has been occupying the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem for more than 56 years.\n\nAccording to the 1907 Hague Regulations, which are considered binding customary law, occupation is a legal measure that a belligerent party can take during war, provided that it is temporary and observes the international legal and humanitarian rules. The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 incorporated the principle of temporariness, which Israel has clearly transgressed. This transgression, in turn, is at the root of all the illegal and aberrant consequences and impacts the Occupied Territories have experienced up to the present day.\n\nFrom the protracted nature of the occupation comes the violation of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and the perpetual character of that violation.\n\nAlthough the substance of the ICJ's advisory opinion is not new - reports by Palestinian and international human rights organisations have long abounded with denunciations of the violations and evidence of their deleterious effects, and the Palestinians have been unflagging in their demands for their rights - and even though the opinion is not binding, it offers a thorough legal assessment on the question of the OPT by the world's highest panel of judges with the relevant expertise in international law and international humanitarian law.\n\nWe thus have an authoritative legal reference and moral compass that other legal and judicial bodies can consult, and once they do, all countervailing arguments attempting to justify the occupation and its practices will fall by the wayside.\n\nThe 80-page advisory opinion, collectively compiled by the ICJ's 15-member panel, was initiated by a request submitted by the UN General Assembly in January 2023. It asked the court for a legal determination on \"the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement, and annexation of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem, and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures.\"\n\nIn its response, the court found that Israel's continued presence in the Palestinian Territories it occupied in 1967 is unlawful and that all Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, along with the entire regime sustaining them are unlawful and must be dismantled.\n\nThe judges condemned Israel's exploitation of Palestinian natural resources in the OPT in a manner contrary to international law and that deprives the Palestinians of their right to sovereignty over their natural resources. They were equally forceful in their condemnation of Israel's expansion of its sphere of legal regulation over the OPT and the disparity between the laws and regulations applied to Palestinians and those applied to Israeli settlers in the territories.\n\nFinally, the judges concluded that Israel must end its unlawful occupation, cease all new settlement activities, evacuate all settlers from the OPT, make reparations for the damage caused to Palestinians in the OPT, and allow Palestinians displaced by the occupation to return to their original place of residence.\n\nLANDMARK RULING: The ICJ's advisory opinion is a legal landmark in the long struggle for Palestinian rights.\n\nComing after decades of injustice, it presents an unequivocal and definitive legal rendering of their plight and status under international law. It says that the Palestinian cause is not about a party in a symmetrical conflict or dispute with a rival claimant to the same plot of land. It is about people under foreign occupation, a situation that, under international law, requires the respect for a broad range of rights of the occupied people, including the right to self-defence, and entails an array of obligations incumbent on the occupying power, namely Israel.\n\nBased on the evidence before it, the court found that \"the violence by settlers against Palestinians, Israel's failure to prevent or to punish it effectively and its excessive use of force against Palestinians contribute to the creation and maintenance of a coercive environment against Palestinians.\" It further underscored the \"systemic\" and \"systematic\" nature of the violence created by the occupation, its settlement policies, and its failure to prevent or punish attacks by settlers. It is an environment that has left Palestinians with no recourse but the inalienable right to self-defence.\n\nThe significance of the ICJ's ruling becomes clear when we contrast its substance with statements by Israeli officials whose denials of the history and reality of the Israeli occupation and disregard for international law and justice have been laid bare. With no rational argument to fall back on, their reaction was to openly display their contempt for the international courts and accuse them of \"anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIsraeli assertions that Israel has a \"religious and historic\" right to the lands that constitute the OPT do not come only from the members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government. Less extremist politicians such as opposition leader Yair Lapid have uttered similar statements. Indeed, the extent to which this view is shared across almost the entire political spectrum in Israel is evidenced by the recently adopted Knesset resolution opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe resolution has joined an entire corpus of legislation intended to permanently strip Palestinians of their right to self-determination in their land, restricting that right exclusively to Jews. The innumerable discriminatory laws, acts, and regulations emerged in tandem with the implementation of the settlement policies that followed on the heels of the occupation of the rest of historic Palestine beyond the \"Green Line\" in 1967.\n\nCarried out by both left- and right-wing governments in Israel, the settlement policies received a major boost from the Oslo Accords, which effectively gave the occupation cover to circumvent the dictates of international law governing occupied territories and to expand settlement construction.\n\nThe ICJ opinion is significant at another level. It is certain to inform other cases currently being considered in The Hague, notably the case brought before the ICJ charging Israel with committing genocide in Gaza and the recently opened International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into Israeli political and military leaders on charges related to war crimes and crimes against humanity in both Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe ICC's investigations are based on allegations that, regardless of the stated aims and military objectives of Israel's assault on Gaza, Israel's methods of pursuing them and the immense human suffering it has caused in the process constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn May, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan applied for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his Defence Minister Yoav Galant. Since then, the ICC tribunal has accepted dozens of briefs from third parties interceding on Israel's behalf in an orchestrated attempt to obstruct the judicial process of holding the Israeli officials accountable for their war crimes. Unfortunately, the phenomenon also opens the ICC to further charges of double standards when it comes to Palestine.\n\nAfter Palestine became a member of the ICC in 2015, it was only able to file a request for an investigation into Israeli crimes in 2018, and then it took another three years before the ICC approved the request. Then, in November 2023, many countries asked the ICC prosecutor to expand his investigations on Palestine to include the genocide that was enfolding in Gaza at the time. Nothing was heard on this matter for the next seven months. Surely, the ICC should take its cue from the breadth and forcefulness of last week's ICJ advisory opinion and fully shoulder its role to administer justice on behalf of Palestinians.\n\nThis brings us to another crucial part of the ICJ's opinion: the legal consequences for other states arising from Israel's \"internationally wrongful acts\" in the OPT. In this regard, the court held that all states and international organisations, including the UN, are \"under an obligation not to recognise as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence\" of Israel in the OPT and \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation\" created by the occupation. Lastly, the court called on the \"United Nations, and especially the General Assembly, which requested this opinion, and the Security Council,\" to \"consider the precise modalities and further action required to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence\" of Israel in the OPT.\n\nThese opinions emanated from the compelling and universally binding nature of the Genocide Convention and were, therefore, the ICJ's way of appealing to all international bodies and members of the international community to shoulder their duty to end decades of wrongdoing and suffering and to bring justice to the Palestinian people.\n\nGiven the Security Council's dismal record in this regard, since its hands are tied by the US veto which has enabled Israel to act with impunity for decades, the General Assembly should take the matter into its own hands. It should pass resolutions calling on Israel to end its occupation and to comply with all relevant international laws and calling for sanctions for non-compliance.\n\nThe writer is a professor of

the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva as part of its special procedures, have called on UN member states to impose an arms embargo and targeted sanctions on Israel.\n\nIn a joint statement on Tuesday, the experts urged UN member states to \"immediately review all diplomatic, political, and economic ties with Israel, inclusive of business and finance, pension funds, academia and charities.\"\n\nThey called on member states to implement an immediate and complete embargo on the sale of arms, munitions and other military equipment to Israel.\n\nThe UN experts added that states must impose targeted sanctions on Israel and investigate dual citizens involved in crimes while serving in the Israeli military, or involved in settler violence in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe call comes as the UK indicated it is looking into restricting some, but not all, arms sales to Israel, althought it has offered no timetable on the decision.\n\nReports have claimed that the Labour government is reviewing evidence to identify which UK-made weapons may have been used in suspected war crimes in Gaza.\n\nThe UN experts' statement is in response to the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) recent landmark advisory opinion that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful and should be brought to an end \"as rapidly as possible\".\n\nJudges at ICJ ruled that member states have a duty to \"take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel\".\n\nThe UN experts said: \"The advisory opinion reaffirms peremptory norms prohibiting annexation, settlements, racial segregation and apartheid, and should be seen as declaratory in nature and binding on Israel and all states supporting the occupation.\"", "source":

All of these illegal colonies in East Jerusalem and the West Bank are home to around 700,000 Israeli settlers.\n\nBack in November, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution reaffirming the illegality of all of Israel's settlements in the West Bank. This resolution was opposed by only seven nations, including Israel, the United States and Canada. (Related: ICJ orders Israel to end its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territories.)\n\nThe ICJ recently ruled in a non-binding 80-page legal opinion on July 26 that Israel must evacuate every single one of the settlers in these territories and pay reparations to all Palestinians who have suffered injury or loss of land or property. The legal opinion also mandates that UN member states \"not recognize as legal\" the situation resulting from Israel's illegal occupation or \"render aid or assistance\" to Israel in maintaining the occupation.\n\nAdditionally, it calls on the UN, especially the General Assembly and Security Council, to consider and implement effective measures to end the unlawful Israeli occupation of Palestine \"as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe backdrop of this ruling is the ongoing conflict in Gaza, where massive destruction and bloodshed continue. Christian authorities in the Middle East and a significant majority of national governments worldwide have long identified this occupation as the \"root\" injustice fueling the conflict between Israeli occupiers and the Palestinian people.\n\nThis decision follows a hearing in February where 45 nations, along with three organizations, testified against the Israeli government. Only four countries - the United States, United Kingdom, Hungary, and Fiji - defended the ongoing occupation.\n\nThe hearing and subsequent judgment were initiated by a December 2022 UN General Assembly resolution requesting the ICJ's opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's continued \"occupation, settlement and annexation\" of Palestinian territory. While the advisory opinion is not legally binding, its legal and moral authority could significantly influence international policies.\n\nThe ruling echoes sentiments previously voiced by Christian bishops in the region. This view has been supported by former Israeli leaders such as Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert and former Israeli Ambassador to South Africa Alon Liel, along with numerous human rights organizations and international bodies.\n\n\"Our people want to put an end to this occupation,\" responded Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN. \"What happened today is a significant step in the direction of ending occupation and attaining the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to self-determination, statehood and the right of the refugees to return.\"\n\nHe indicated that Palestinian officials would carefully consider the ruling's implications and work towards a comprehensive resolution in the UN General Assembly.\n\nMeanwhile, Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, celebrated the decision as a \"big victory for the Palestinian cause.\"\n\n\"From a legal perspective, Israel is already indicted and condemned for its policies, for its occupation, settlements, and illegal apartheid rule,\" he said. \"The highest legal structure in the world has confirmed there is occupation, and it is illegal.\"\n\nHowever, Israeli officials has claimed that the ICJ and many nations across the globe are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"The decision in The Hague proves for the umpteenth time that this is a distinctly antisemitic and political organization,\" stated National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. He reiterated his call for the full annexation of the West Bank and Gaza and insisted that \"the time has come for governance and sovereignty.\"\n\nMoreover, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, anticipating the ruling, urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to defy international legal obligations by annexing the recognized Palestinian territories. This stance aligns with the broader hard-right perspective within the Israeli government.\n\nIsraelCollapse.com contains similar stories regarding Israeli violations of international law.\n\nWatch the

Much will go into analysing that ruling, but there is one big question that needs to be asked: how is this reminder of international law, and its position on Israel's occupation, going to reverberate in the United States particularly, and the West more widely?\n\nThe content of the ruling was not entirely unexpected - international law, when it comes to this particular issue, is rather clear, and has been for decades. Nevertheless, it was a reconfirmation of where international law stood: all of these territories are under Israeli occupation; that occupation is unlawful; and it should not be normalised. In the Arab world, and much further afield in the Global South, there was a good deal of support expressed for the ruling, also unsurprisingly.\n\nOf course, Israel rejected the court's findings, which was quite expected. But an irony was emphatically manifested in how the US specifically, but also much of the West, responded to, quite literally, the \"World Court\": by suggesting that its authority, which they say they recognise and respect, does not extend to them and their allies. This, while ironic, was also hardly surprising.\n\nThe US has long publicly expressed support for the \"rules-based order\", and international law that is meant to underpin those rules, but ignored international law when it fell foul of its interests and even tried to circumvent its institutions. Take, for example, the institution of the International Criminal Court (ICC). A Democratic president, Bill Clinton, supported the establishment of the court during his tenure - but the Rome Statute that established the court was never ratified by the US. In the past few years, elected US officials have simultaneously supported and attacked the ICC. When the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin, for example, the US supported its work. But when the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, declared he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli officials (as well as Hamas'), Washington rejected the notion altogether, with US President Joe Biden saying it was \"outrageous\". Secretary of State Antony Blinken said thereafter that the administration would work with Congress to essentially punish the ICC, due to precisely these warrants.\n\nElections are due in the US in less than 100 days. A Republican victory is entirely possible, which would thus deliver not only a second Donald Trump administration but also an administration that would contain a vice president who demanded only a few weeks ago that the Department of Justice investigate and prosecute Khan due to these proposed warrants on Israeli officials. It is a staggering prospect, but one that JD Vance takes seriously enough that he signed onto a letter (PDF) along with several other Republican senators, which accused Khan of supporting terrorism through his \"targeting of Israeli officials\", and thus ought to be investigated by the Department of Justice for breaking US law. As damaging as that might be vis-a-vis the integrity of the ICC, it ought to be noted: the ICC is an institution that Washington does not recognise the authority of, and never has. That is very different from the ICJ, which the US does at least recognise. On the ICJ, the most aggressive responses in Washington, DC came from outside the Biden administration, on the right of the political spectrum. Much like several Israeli politicians, they attacked the June 19 ruling as \"anti-Semitic\", but considering so many rights and legal organisations have already come to the same conclusions about the Palestinian territories over the decades, the objections appeared less than convincing, particularly when one considers the wide swath of even European political opinion that expressed support for the ruling. That included barometers of establishment thinking such as the Financial Times, the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, and many others. Poignantly, High Representative Josep Borrell noted, \"In a world of constant and increasing violations of international law, it is our moral duty to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to all ICJ decisions in a consistent manner, irrespective of the subject in question.\"\n\nBut there was still a bipartisan consensus of sorts in DC, at the minimum, that the ICJ ruling that Israel had to immediately withdraw from the occupied territories was contrary to the \"established framework\" for resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. That consensus is correct, but not in the way that perhaps it is meant; international law itself assumes a very different framework than what has been taken by political leaders to be the way forward. The real critique, therefore, is really about the framework - not international law and the ICJ.\n\nBearing that in mind, what does that mean for the US? As much as it might be tempting to consider that this is an isolated, cordoned-off part of US foreign policy, the world will not see it as such. One intriguing comment in this regard came from one of the most noted Conservative politicians of this generation in the United Kingdom, perhaps the most stalwart of US allies.\n\n\"Beyond the customary verbal condemnation, the West turned a blind eye to these breaches [of international law]. We made it clear by our apathy that Israel was an exception to the rules. We in the West are now dangerously exposed by that apathy,\" Nicholas Soames, a Conservative member of the House of Lords and grandson of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, said at a July 25 debate.\n\n\"In September 2022, the UN independent commission concluded in its report to the UNGA that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory 'was unlawful under international law owing to its permanence and to actions undertaken by Israel to annex parts of the land de facto and de jure'. The commission stated that the permanent occupation and annexation by Israel could not remain unaddressed, and the General Assembly requested that the ICJ provide an advisory opinion. That opinion finally arrived on Friday. It stated that the occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal under international law. This ruling was welcomed as historic, clear and unambiguous, but it only formalised what we already knew ... If the West is to maintain any hold or credibility in upholding the rules-based order on which we all depend, the rule of law must apply to all equally.\"\n\nSoames was referring to Israel's conduct in light of international law, both in Gaza, and in the rest of the occupied territories of East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The point that he raised vis-a-vis Western credibility in upholding the rules-based order is rather poignant; because, indeed, it is that system which states, large and small, depend upon. At the same time, it is an order that can only claim any validity, if the rule of law is regarded as valid upon all as well. Otherwise, these are not rules - they are simply arbitrary tools and will be regarded as such by the international community writ large. That not only means that the world will see the US as hypocritical - but, critically, that the rules-based order no longer has any meaning to it. And that would have consequences far beyond the present moment.\n\nThere may be some that regard such a development to be insignificant or unsubstantial, but that would be remarkably shortsighted. Whether it is a Republican or a Democrat in the White House, it will still be a USA that will seek to engage in the world. For all the bravado and rhetoric about a return to \"American isolationism\", if Trump returns to the White House, it is remarkable how much he wants to be involved in the world. His motto, after all, is not \"America Only\" - it's \"America First\". Indeed, even if the US wanted to genuinely withdraw from the world, it wouldn't be able to; international health issues like COVID, climate change, and many other crises do not pay attention to national borders. In the Middle East, a Republican-led US would continue to be involved, but differently; the same in Africa, Asia, and Europe.\n\nBut herein lies the rub; if the US is going to continue to be involved in the world beyond its borders - it will, by necessity, have to build alliances, and rely on at least some multilateral institutions. How much political capital will the US find itself having with would-be partners in the world of multilateralism and alliance building if, indeed, Washington is perceived as considering itself and its allies above the law? If the international order - such as it is - begins to go through a slow meltdown, due to the weakening of international legal institutions; if the multilateral system becomes more and more fragile, as a result of the fracturing we see; what then is the alternative? A return to \"survival of the fittest\", but in the 21st century, where technology can make almost every crisis existential quite quickly?\n\nAs Soames declared: \"We can either cast aside selective blindness, recognise and act upon Rule of Law, without fear or favour, however difficult it may be. Or we can continue in determined blindness. But if we do that latter, we must know that we are jettisoning an order that was hard-won, we cannot be surprised when other world actors replace it, and we cannot be surprised at the consequences that follow.\" Is that better for the US and Western interests, after all?", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Canadian government must take the following steps to ensure that it aligns its foreign policy with international law as outlined in the ICJ advisory opinion.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion, the ICJ mandated the General Assembly and the Security Council to \"consider what further action is required to put an end to the illegal presence of Israel\" in the OPT, and called on all states to cooperate with the UN to achieve this goal.\n\nCanada is therefore obliged to assist the UN in bringing an end to Israel's unlawful presence in the OPT. Given that this issue is certain to arise at future meetings of the UNGA and other UN bodies, Canada must be prepared to support all initiatives that affirm the ICJ opinion and seek Israel's compliance, which may involve (at a minimum) co-sponsoring and voting in support of resolutions. Canada must also urge the United States not to veto any resolutions that may come before the Security Council on this matter.\n\nUnfortunately, Canada has not supported the UN's efforts to date, but voted against the initial UNGA resolution and tried to dissuade the court from rendering a decision. As you know, the ICJ easily rejected the arguments submitted by Canada to the court, concluding that there were no compelling reasons for it to decline to render an opinion. We also remind you that earlier this year, you personally voted for a resolution in Parliament to \"support the work of the International Court of Justice\" in the context of Israel's war on Gaza. Following the clear legal conclusions of the ICJ, we expect to see Canada finally drop its obstructionist role, and join efforts to hold Israel accountable for these grave breaches of the rules-based international order.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion, the ICJ found that Israel's actions \"amount to annexation of large parts\" of the OPT. The ICJ notes that this violates Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations and is \"contrary to the prohibition of the use of force in international relations and its corollary principle of the non-acquisition of territory by force.\" This represents a major breach of a fundamental principle of international law.\n\nIn other contexts, Canada claims to uphold this principle with the utmost seriousness. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, your office issued a statement saying that Russia's actions were \"in violation of Russia's obligations under international law and the Charter of the United Nations.\"\n\nCanada accompanied these political statements in defence of the UN Charter with the swift imposition of a comprehensive set of sanctions targeting the Russian state and economy under the Special Economic Measures Act. Since 2022, Canada has amended its sanctions against Russia at least 46 times, targeting government and military officials, but also expanding restrictions on military trade, financial and energy sectors, the oil and gas industry, prohibitions on ships from docking or entering Canadian waters, the trade in luxury goods, and much more.Canada has separately imposed sanctions on individuals and entities related to Russia's illegal occupation of Ukrainian territory.\n\nCanada has set a certain standard in its response to Russian violations of the UN Charter, and this standard must be applied to Israel. Canada must impose sanctions on Israel under the Special Economic Measures Act, targeting government and military officials as well as individuals and entities tied to Israel's illegal presence in the OPT. Sanctions should be commensurate with Israel's breaches of international law, and no less significant than Canadian sanctions targeting Russia. Anything less would reveal an extraordinary double standard in Canada's application of international law.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion, the ICJ concluded that states including Canada are under an obligation to structure their economic relations with Israel so that they do not contribute to its illegal presence in the OPT. Specifically, the ICJ found that states are obliged to:\n\nPer the above, Canada is already violating these obligations through the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA). CIFTA extends free trade benefits to the entire territory under Israeli control, including settlements in the OPT, and fails to distinguish between Israel and the OPT. As such, CIFTA operates as if the OPT was formally annexed by Israel.In the past, Canada has attempted to justify CIFTA's jurisdiction over the OPT based on the Paris Protocols (economic agreements between Israel and the PLO associated with the Oslo peace process). However, the ICJ's Advisory Opinion explicitly noted that the Oslo Accords \"cannot be understood to detract from Israel's obligations under the pertinent rules of international law applicable in the [OPT],\" and that \"Israel may not rely on the Oslo Accords to exercise its jurisdiction in the [OPT] in a manner that is at variance with its obligations under the law of occupation.\" Neither can Canada continue to point to Oslo, or the Paris Protocols, to justify an economic agreement that materially benefits Israel's illegal presence in the OPT.\n\nTo comply with its obligations as outlined by the ICJ, Canada must therefore cancel CIFTA due to its application to territory unlawfully occupied by Israel. Canada must also prohibit all trade in goods and services with Israel's settlement enterprise, and prohibit trade with any other Israeli sectors that help maintain Israel's illegal presence in the OPT.\n\nThe ICJ Advisory Opinion \"reaffirms that the Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the r\u00e9gime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law.\" This includes the illegal transfer of settlers into occupied territory, the exploitation of natural resources, the forcible transfer of Palestinians from their homes, and \"Israel's systematic failure to prevent or to punish attacks by settlers.\" The ICJ concluded that Israel is obliged to provide restitution, including the immediate \"evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements\" in the OPT.\n\nAlthough Canada has imposed targeted sanctions on some individuals and organizations associated with extremist settler violence, this approach has failed to address the fundamental responsibility of the Israeli state as outlined by the ICJ. My organization has previously written to you about the need to adopt a \"Whole-of-Government Approach\" to address Canadian complicity in the settlements, which are a war crime under Canadian law. We put forward a series of 19 recommendations across 7 ministerial portfolios, including imposing economic sanctions on the Israeli settlement economy under the Special Economic Measures Act, revoking the charitable status of organizations that transfer money to settlements, and prosecuting the promotion and sale of settlement properties. By enacting these recommendations, Canada could move significantly towards compliance with its obligations as outlined by the ICJ.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion, the ICJ says that states like Canada are obliged \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the [OPT],\" and must \"take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel in the [OPT].\"\n\nThere is no question that Canada's military trade with Israel assists in the maintenance of Israel's unlawful occupation. The export of weapons and military technology to Israel directly supports its military control over the OPT, while the import of Israeli weapons indirectly supports the occupation by sustaining the country's defence industry and legitimizing its testing of new weaponry on Palestinians.\n\nTo ensure that it is not rendering aid or assistance to Israel's illegal military occupation of the OPT, Canada must impose a comprehensive two-way arms embargo under the Special Economic Measures Act.\n\nAs noted above, the ICJ in its Advisory Opinion asserted that states like Canada are obliged \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the [OPT].\"\n\nCanada violates this obligation through the Canada-Israel Strategic Partnership, which was established through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2014. The Strategic Partnership binds Canada to collaborate with many different branches of the Israeli state that are actively involved in maintaining its illegal occupation. For example, under the MOU, Canada is supposed to collaborate with the Israeli Ministry of Defence and the Israeli Ministry of National Security on issues including military-to-military relations, joint military operations, defence procurement, counter-terrorism, and cyber security.\n\nGiven that Israel's role as an illegal occupying power is premised on its military control over the OPT, there is no question that Canadian collaboration with these ministries renders aid and assistance in maintaining Israel's illegal presence. This is especially pertinent given the ICJ's 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which found that Israel cannot claim to exercise a right to self-defence in territories that it occupies. To comply with its obligations as outlined by the ICJ, Canada must immediately terminate the Canada-Israel Strategic Partnership by sending written notice to the Israeli government.\n\nIn its Advisory Opinion, the ICJ found that \"Israel's unlawful policies and practices are in breach of Israel's obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\" It noted that Israel's deprivation of this right has been prolonged for decades, which \"undermines the exercise of this right in the future.\" Critically, the ICJ expressed that \"the existence of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination cannot be subject to conditions on the part of the occupying Power, in view of its character as an inalienable right.\"\n\nIn light of the ICJ's findings, Canada must recognize the State of Palestine immediately. I note that Canada's former opposition to Palestinian statehood has recently softened, with your statement that Canada is \"prepared to recognize the State of Palestine at the time most conducive to lasting peace, not necessarily as the last step along that path.\" However, the Advisory Opinion is clear that self-determination cannot be left indefinitely in a state of \"suspension and uncertainty\" or be conditioned on the demands of the illegal occupier. The rights of the Palestinian people as outlined by the ICJ cannot be bargained or negotiated away. Canada must recognize Palestine now, and work to realize the right of self-determination by ending Israel's illegal presence in the OPT.\n\nI urge you to immediately take the above steps to ensure that Canada upholds international law and complies with the ICJ Advisory Opinion. I look forward to hearing from you regarding this urgent matter.\n\nCJPME's mission is to enable Canadians of all backgrounds to promote justice, development and peace in the Middle East, and here at

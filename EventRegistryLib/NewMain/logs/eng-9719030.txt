Citing Section 30 of the Karnataka Prisons Act, which permits undertrial prisoners to receive proper food and other necessities, he seeks the court's intervention.Kannada actor Darshan Thoogudeepa, currently in judicial custody at Bengaluru's Central Prison, has filed a petition with the Karnataka High Court requesting permission for home-cooked food, personal clothing, bedding, cutlery, and books. The actor claims the prison food is causing severe health issues, including weight loss and diarrhoea, which has been diagnosed as food poisoning by prison doctors.\n\nDarshan, arrested on June 11, 2024, in connection with the murder of his fan Renukaswamy, argues that under Section 30 of the Karnataka Prisons Act, 1963, undertrial prisoners are entitled to receive proper food, clothing, and other necessities, subject to examination by prison authorities. Despite this, his requests for home-cooked food have been denied by prison officials, citing the need for a court order.\n\nIn his petition, Darshan states that he has been unfairly implicated in the case based on statements from co-accused individuals and is seeking legal assistance for his bail application. The petition is scheduled for a court hearing on Wednesday.\n\nHome Minister G Parameshwara addressed allegations of VIP treatment for Darshan, clarifying, \"He has not been given biryani for meals. In every aspect, including meeting family members, Darshan is being treated like a common prisoner.\"\n\nRenukaswamy, a 33-year-old auto driver and fan of Darshan, was found dead near a stormwater drain in Sumanahalli, Bengaluru, on June 9. He had allegedly sent obscene messages to Darshan's co-star and friend Pavithra Gowda, which reportedly enraged the actor.\n\nPolice sources indicate that Renukaswamy was brought to a shed in R R Nagar on the pretext of meeting Darshan, where he was tortured and murdered on June 8.\n\nThe post-mortem report revealed that Renukaswamy died from shock and haemorrhage due to multiple blunt injuries. Pavithra Gowda, identified as the primary instigator, allegedly conspired with other accused and participated in the crime.\n\nDarshan's legal team, led by Criminal Lawyer C V Nagesh, is working to gather necessary documents for his bail application. Meanwhile, Darshan's petition emphasizes the urgent need for home-cooked food and other personal items to ensure his well-being in prison.\n\nThe court's decision on this matter will be crucial in determining whether Darshan will be allowed to receive these items from his family during his time in custody.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cutlery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._G._Parameshwara", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dr. G.

After the murder, his body was disposed of in a gutter.\n\nThe incident came to light after the security personnel of a private apartment saw the body being dragged by a pack of dogs. Renukaswamy is survived by aged parents, a pregnant wife and a sister.\n\nWhen the police began the investigation, four of the accused surrendered to the police, claiming responsibility for the murder over a financial matter. After Kamakshipalya police interrogated them, the involvement of actor Darshan, his 'partner' Pavithra Gowda, and others came to light.\n\nIt was revealed that the accused had brutally hacked Renukaswamy to death for sending obscene messages to Pavithra Gowda. Actor Darshan and 15 others have been remanded to judicial custody until July 18.", "source": {"uri": "mangalorean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mangalorean.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Convict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakshipalya", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamakshipalya"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitradurga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.mangalorean.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DARSHAN_ARREST_02.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719030", "eventUri": "eng-9719030", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 2391, "textEnd": 2398}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 2450, "textEnd": 2456}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 3319, "textEnd": 3326}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

His plea: a request for the prison authorities to permit him to receive homemade food during his time in custody. Here's what Darshan added to his petition. Scroll down to find more details.\n\nSince Darshan is the prime suspect in Renukaswamy's murder case, on June 11, the actor was arrested from his farm house and since then Darsham is police custody. Spending close to one month, Thoogudeepa has now petitioned for things like silverware, clothing, bedsheets and something books read. His letter highlights a considerable weight loss due to the challenge of eating and properly breaking down the food given in prison. He even battled with diarrhea that the prison's medical team think could be food poisoning. Basing his letter on Section 30 of the Karnataka Prisons Act of 1963, he indicates that inmates are allowed these necessities after an inspection, and only if the Prison's Inspector General approves. However, its important to note that Darshan's petition is yet to be heard by the court.\n\nTaken from reports issued by police authorities, there was a troubling situation involving a 33-year-old man named Renukaswamy. He was known to be an admirer of the actor, however, his troublesome behaviour led to him sending offensive messages to Darshan's friend, Pavithra Gowda, who is now implicated in the case. Darshan reacted strongly to his actions, which unfortunately culminated in a grim turn of events - his premature death. On June 9th, his lifeless body was found near a stormwater drain, just beside an apartment in Sumanahalli, Bengaluru.\n\nRaghavendra, who is a part of Darshan's fan club in Chitradurga, deceived Renukaswamy by promising a meeting with the actor in a shed based in RR Nagar. Sadly, this was the very place where Renukaswamy was reportedly subjected to brutal treatment, leading to his untimely demise on June 8th.\n\nAs per the post-mortem report, Renukaswamy, originally from Chitradurga, succumbed to shock and internal bleeding, resulting from persistent blunt force injuries.\n\nAccording to police statements, Pavithra, identified as the main suspect, played a significant role in Renukaswamy's murder. The investigation reveals she not only influenced others but also actively participated in planning and carrying out the crime.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darsham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darsham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darsham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foodborne illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitradurga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chitradurga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Darshan-Thoogudeepa-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719030", "eventUri": "eng-9719030", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 432, "textEnd": 439}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 1614, "textEnd": 1622}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 2012, "textEnd": 2020}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The post-mortem report revealed that Renukaswamy died due to shock and hemorrhage from multiple blunt injuries.\n\nGowda is considered the \"major cause\" of Renukaswamy's murder, according to police sources. Evidence from the investigation suggests she instigated other accused individuals, conspired with them, and participated in the crime. All accused parties, including Thoogudeepa and a member of his fan club named Raghavendra who allegedly lured Renukaswamy to his death, will remain in judicial detention until July 18.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kannada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutlery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cutlery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foodborne illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/23035991720600486.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719030", "eventUri": "eng-9719030", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 1201, "textEnd": 1207}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 1725, "textEnd": 1732}], "sentiment": -0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Police have booked a total of 17 people in connection with the case. Among them, four are currently held in Tumkur Jail, while the remaining 13, including actor Darshan and Pavitra Gowda, are in Parappana Agrahara Central Prison. As the investigation deepens, the situation is becoming increasingly challenging.\n\nIn the midst of this, actor Darshan is reportedly suffering from severe food poisoning and diarrhoea, attributed to the jail food. This health scare prompted Darshan's lawyer to file a writ petition in the High Court, requesting permission for Darshan to receive home-cooked food. The petition also seeks approval to bring in a bed and books from his home.\n\nRenukaswamy murder case: Darshan, Pavithra Gowda's fingerprints found on objects belonging to victim\n\nThe petition reveals that the prison authorities have denied Darshan the right to receive home-made meals, clothing, utensils, bedding, and books. It states that Darshan is experiencing indigestion and diarrhoea due to the food provided in jail, leading to significant health concerns.\n\nRenukaswamy murder case: Judicial custody extended for 14 days for 17 accused including Darshan\n\nA doctor from the jail has diagnosed Darshan with food poisoning, confirming that the jail food is adversely affecting his health. Reports suggest that Darshan has lost a considerable amount of weight as a result. The lack of response from prison authorities to address these issues has raised serious concerns. Without intervention, Darshan's health may continue to deteriorate, leaving no other option but to appeal to the High Court for relief. Therefore, a formal request has been submitted to allow Darshan's family to provide him with home-cooked meals.\n\nSome private websites have reported that Darshan has lost up to 10 kg due to the poor quality of jail food. Additionally, there are rumours in Gandhi Nagar that Darshan might be replaced in the film \"Coastal\" by hat-trick hero Shivrajkumar, though the film's team has yet to issue any official statement. These developments have left Darshan's fans worried and upset.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darshan_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darshan (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foodborne_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foodborne illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumkur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tumkur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tumkur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhi_Nagar,_Karnataka_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gandhi Nagar, Karnataka Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Rajkumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiva Rajkumar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01j2e0y3nbmqgdj46wgbhwfsg3/darshan-jail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719030", "eventUri": "eng-9719030", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

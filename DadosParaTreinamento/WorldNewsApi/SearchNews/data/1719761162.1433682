Janhvi said that she still hasn't come to terms with the loss of her mother and she retains her calm by devoting herself to work. On the show, Janhvi was shown a picture from her childhood days and asked how she was back then. Janhvi revealed that as a kid she would often sneak into her parents' room to check if they were breathing. Janhvi said, \"It's funny, but I was always paranoid about losing my parents, even at that age. Every time they'd go out at night for an event, or travel for a day without me... Even small things, like they're shopping at duty free and I've boarded the plane with my nanny, I'd always be like, 'They're not going to board the flight, they're not going to come back home'. I'd wake up at night and sometimes go into their room to check if they were breathing. There was a weird paranoia.\" A couple of days ago, Janhvi visited her mother Sridevi's most favourite place in Chennai - Muppathamman temple. Janhvi shared images from her visit.

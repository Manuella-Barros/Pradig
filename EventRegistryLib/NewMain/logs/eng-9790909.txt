I looked at my wife, and she looked over and couldn't say anything.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Taco Bell for comment, which provided the following statement: \"We take this very seriously. We are looking into this matter and strive to make things right with the customer.\"\n\nJeremy adds that he \"felt sick for two days\" afterward and is still suffering from a sore throat as a result.\n\nSo disgusted by the discovery in his food, Jeremy took to Reddit (u/TheeSqueebles) and shared several pictures of the nose piercing on r/mildlyinfuriating. The post generated over 45,000 votes and 4,200 comments since it was shared on July 24.\n\n\"I decided to share it online because I thought it was so egregious that others would like to see it,\" Jeremy told Newsweek.\n\nHe contacted the local branch of Taco Bell immediately after finding the piercing in his takeout food, but he said the manager seemed \"mostly unbothered\" and didn't take responsibility. He was told that the piercing couldn't have come from their kitchen and that they'd be in touch with him.\n\n\"I just wish the manager had a bit more integrity and would take responsibility for this. It very clearly was an employee who made a mistake, but instead, they used the rhetoric that it wasn't their fault. But who else could it be? If not the store, then the distribution center, maybe, but that's less believable to me,\" Jeremy said.\n\n\"Even if Taco Bell reaches out, they'll likely just offer gift cards or coupons, but why on Earth would I want to eat there again? A metal nose ring from another human was in my throat, and I almost choked -- yet I'll be offered free tacos.\n\n\"There's no accountability, and no reason I'd want free tacos for mental and physical pain, no matter how small,\" he said.\n\nWith over 4,200 comments on the viral Reddit post so far, internet users were appalled by the discovery.\n\nOne comment reads: \"And this is why we're usually not allowed to wear jewelry in food service.\"\n\nAnother person wrote: \"I am traumatized on your behalf.\"\n\n\"Disgusting.

According to Newsweek, Jeremy, a resident of Virginia, had ordered two steak-cheesy street chalupas from the fast-food chain on July 24. As he was finishing his meal, he felt \"something sharp\" in his throat.\n\nThe 33-year-old was able to dislodge the object from his throat but it got stuck between his molars when he tried to take another bite. Upon spitting out the item, he was horrified to discover that he had been chewing on a nose ring. \"I was in pure shock when I realized what it was. I looked at my wife, and she looked over and couldn't say anything,\" he told Newsweek.\n\nHe further told the Weekly that after the incident he \"felt sick for two days\" and he is still dealing with a sore throat as a result. Jeremy took to Reddit to share photos of the nose ring he found in his food. He said that he decided to do so because he thought it was \"so egregious that others would like to see it.\"\n\nAfter the ordeal, Jeremy contacted the local Taco Bell branch, but found the manager to be \"mostly unbothered\" and unwilling to take responsibility.

In the comment section, one user advised, \"Go directly to Taco Bell corporate with this. Let them know you will be reaching out to your local food safety inspectors as well. You need to report this.

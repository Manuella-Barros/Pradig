The triple Formula One world champion watched rivals set the pace before producing a best lap of one minute 04.686 seconds, as the crowd roared in response, to leave Norris just 0.093 slower. Friday's sprint qualifying session for the 100km race replaced the usual second practice.

Mexican Sergio Perez starts a disappointing seventh for Red Bull with Alpine's Esteban Ocon eighth and team mate Pierre Gasly ninth. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start 10th after failing to cross the line in time to get in a flying lap in the final phase. \"I don't know what happened. I was in the pit lane and I got the anti-stall then everything switched off,\" said the Ferrari driver.

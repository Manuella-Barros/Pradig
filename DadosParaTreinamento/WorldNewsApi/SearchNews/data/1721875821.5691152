SoraNews24\u2019s ultimate on-foot guide for Japan\u2019s former capital\u3010Part 4\u3011", "text": "It\u2019s time for the final part of our epic Kyoto stroll! Welcome back to SoraNews24\u2019s no-bus, all-walking sightseeing guide to Kyoto. To recap, we put this one-day walking route together in response to Kyoto\u2019s increasingly overcrowded buses, which were, once upon a time, the most convenient way to make the rounds of the city\u2019s temples, shrines, and other sightseeing attractions. Since we\u2019re focusing on the route, we\u2019re including a ton of sights along the way, more than you could comfortably fit in spending time inside of all on the same day. It\u2019s always nice to have plenty of options, though, especially since the final choice of which spots to head inside of will depend on your personal preferences and any prior experience you may have traveling in Kyoto, and whether you want to revisit places you\u2019ve been before or focus on new ones. So far, in Parts 1, 2, and 3, we\u2019ve covered five segments of our course, which started at Kyoto Station at 7 o\u2019clock in the morning: \u25cf Kyoto Station to Fushimi Inari Shrine \u25cf Fushimi Inari Shrine to Kiyomizudera Temple \u25cf Kiyomizudera Temple to Nanzenji Temple \u25cf Nanzenji Temple to Shimogamo Shrine \u25cf Shimogamo Shrine to Higashi Honganji Temple In this article, we\u2019ll be covering the sixth, and final, part of the route. \u25cf Section 6: Higashi Honganji Temple to Kitano Tenmangu Shrine We left off at Higashi Honganji Temple (seen in the above photo), having arrived there at 1:30 in the afternoon. Our next stop was Byodoji Temple (\u5e73\u7b49\u5bfa), a stately looking structure nestled among office buildings, demonstrating just how entwined Kyoto\u2019s history is with present-day life in the city. \u25bc Walking route from Higashi Honganji to Byodoji Continuing north brings us to Rokkakudo (\u516d\u89d2\u5802), which translates to \u201csix-sided hall\u201d and refers to the unique hexagonal shape of the temple\u2019s main building. While we\u2019re in the neighborhood, let\u2019s swing by the Kyoto International Manga Museum\u2026 \u2026and then Nijo Castle (\u4e8c\u6761\u57ce), Nijo Castle exhibits some distinctive traits among Japanese castles. Built after the end of the most intense fighting of Japan\u2019s centuries-long Sengoku period civil wars, Nijo Castle was primarily designed as a comfortable estate for the shogun to stay in when visiting Kyoto, not as a fortress, and so it has a lower, more palatial layout than the typical tower-centered castle. \u25bc Outer edge of Nijo Castle grounds Swinging back to the south gets us to Hokkeji Temple (\u6cd5\u83ef\u5bfa) \u2026and after one last strolling spurt, we\u2019re at Kitano Tenmangu Shrine (\u5317\u91ce\u5929\u6e80\u5bae), the final stop on our no-bus Kyoto route! So what were the final time and step tallies for the whole thing, all segments from start to finish? We started walking at Kyoto Station at 7 a.m., and it was 3:19 in the afternoon when we got to Kitano Tenmangu Shrine for a total of 8 hours and 19 minutes. As for our steps\u2026 \u2026we took 43,007 of them! So yeah, we defiantly weren\u2019t going to feel guilty about treating ourselves to some of Kyoto\u2019s famous matcha green tea sweets after all that exercise. Before we wrap things up we should say, once again, that we don\u2019t necessarily recommend you do this whole walking course in one day. Not that we\u2019re going to try to talk you out of it, either. If you\u2019re into super-long walks, feel free to go crazy and do it all in one day! But most people will tell you that a Kyoto trip is most enjoyable when you slow down and give yourself time to stop and soak up the atmosphere at a smaller number of sites, rather than rushing to see as many as possible. Because of that, we suggest using our guide not as a strict itinerary, but as a resource to help you avoid the stress of Kyoto\u2019s crowded buses while also getting to see it from a local, on-foot perspective. Do as many of the segments as strike your interest and fit within your preferred travel tempo. Happy walking, and maybe we\u2019ll see each other out there on our next Kyoto walk.

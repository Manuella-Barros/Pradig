{"id": 243362150, "title": "Mighty Mukuru Wanderers rake in K80 million in replicas\u2019 sales \u2013 The Times Group", "text": "Mighty Mukuru Wanderers have generated over K80 million from the sales of the new replica jerseys in a space of three months. This could be a bold step towards commercialisation drive for the club. The Nomads replica jerseys hit the market in April with the white kit selling at K20,000 whereas the blue one is going at K15,000. Wanderers Chief Executive Officer Panganeni Ndovi disclosed that they have sold 5,600 replica jerseys out of 6,000 in the first consignment. Ndovi attributed the quick sales to the high quality of the replica jerseys and also the pricing. \u201cThe replica jerseys are of high quality and the price is also affordable for most of the people. We are very happy that our supporters have appreciated the colours and the quality of the jerseys for this season,\u201d Ndovi said. Ndovi said they have already ordered a second consignment of the replica jerseys. \u201cThe second consignment is expected to be in the country soon and we hope the fans will continue supporting the club by buying the replica jerseys,\u201d he said. This is the first time for Wanderers to sell over 5,000 replica jerseys in a space of three months. The local clubs including FCB Nyasa Big Bullets, who have a huge fan base in the country, have also struggled to sell the replica jerseys for a long time. Sports analyst Parry Chinyama said local teams were sitting on untapped gold for failing to generate resources through the sales of replica jerseys. \u201cThe sales of more than 90 percent of their products means that the fans have embraced the replica jerseys. This will encourage the team management to produce more. However, my advice to management is that they should produce another set which should be slightly cheaper,\u201d Chinyama said. In a related development, Silver have sold more than 300 pieces of replicas out of 1,000 in the first consignment. Silver Chief Executive Officer Patrick Chimimba said the kits are in demand. \u201cWe have sold a lot of replica jerseys in the space of one month. We are happy that the fans have embraced the replica jerseys,\u201d Chimimba said. The replica jerseys for Bullets have already hit the market. Apart from the three teams, clubs such as Chitipa United, Bangwe All Stars and Premier Bet Dedza Dynamos have also replica jerseys.", "summary": "Mighty Mukuru Wanderers have generated over K80 million from the sales of the new replica jerseys in a space of three months.

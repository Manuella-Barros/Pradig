{"id": 231953958, "title": "OPEN LETTER TO PRIME MINISTER", "text": "Your Excellency, First and foremost, let me express my belated congratulations on your appointment to the hot seat, to lead His Majesty\u2019s government for five years. Indeed, His Majesty the King made the right good choice to go for a youthful, focus minded and energetic man. As a nation we are hopeful that under your astute leadership, the country will definitely accomplish the dream of attaining the much yearned for and much talked about First World status. I wish you and the entire government all the luck and success in executing this mammoth task before you of steering the country out of many social and economic ills including poverty, inequality and the deep-rooted cancerous disease of corruption. Zeal and zest Your Excellency, during the brief stint at the helm of His Majesty\u2019s government one has noticed some glimpse of the zeal and zest accomplished with the quicksilver speed in executing national chores, which really dovetails the \u2018nkwe\u2019 royal command syndrome. The \u2018nkwe\u2019 command has definitely set the whole new government singing the chorus of fighting and uprooting any form of corruption that has of late infested every vein of this homogeneous Eswatini society. But honourable prime minister, please be warned that many a time, wishes are not horses for every wisher to ride. It is easier said than done, \u2018ayingangamlonyeni\u2019. Fighting and eradicating corruption in our beautiful kingdom of Eswatini nation is not a child\u2019s play, corruption in the country, you will agree that it has manifested itself in many forms and eradicating it is like challenging a fight with an octopus or the mystery snake \u2018Ulamlambo\u2019 which you kill now but across the river it has resurrected. There are many forms of corruption in the country and most of these are institutionalised. Government herself must do a self-introspection if the \u2018nkwe\u2019 syndrome has to work and yield results that will bring everlasting joy in Eswatini. It is common knowledge that a person should work in order to earn a salary, hence the no-work-no-pay rule. In other words, it is corruption and crime to bombard people with hefty salaries, with many perks of fringe benefits for minimum job. Your Excellency, the Right Honourable prime minister it is open secret that government is paying hefty salaries and benefits to people whose jobs do not call for such sky rocketing remunerations at the expense of the poor emaSwati. This is a crime against humanity and corruption at its best. Falling under this category Your Excellency, includes the many huge statutory Boards (emabandla) and several individuals. Life in the rural areas governed by traditional leaders, including the venerable chiefs is chaotic and very painful for the ordinary underprivileged destitute liSwati. The situation is so bad that some good and law abiding citizens have lost their lives because those who are supposed to attend to such matters are sleeping on the job and enjoying the exorbitant salaries/freebies. Chiefdoms are a fertile ground for mass corruption and crime committed by the very trusted servants of the crown. Each and every chiefdom is littered with clusters of informal settlements (tikomu), which, in the not so distant future, will be a burden on government. Traditional leaders are making a kill through the rampant land sale. The Land Management Board and government are watching helplessly hence \u2018nkwe\u2019 must be seen in action in such malpractices. What King Sobhuza II had initiated to develop emaSwati through the rural settlement schemes, it has died a natural death, with RDAs grounded to a halt or just white elephants. Your Excellency the Honourable prime minister, these are some of glaring facts that you will find throwing spanners in the works in the quest of embarking on the much sang about \u2018nkwe\u2019 to fight and eradicate corruption in institutions. Corruption is in our blood You uproot corruption, you kill almost the entire Eswatini nation for corruption is in our blood veins. Even some of your members of parliament are not so honourable because they are rumoured to have bribed their path to the august House. Lastly, Your Excellency: What is your take about the now somehow institutionalised rampant dagga farming and selling in Eswatini? A toddler, school going children and even grandmothers and grandfathers, from East to West, North to South every sector of the society is involved in this lucrative booming illicit dagga trade in this beautiful kingdom of Eswatini. Let \u2018nkwe\u2019 come into positive play instead of being just a useless slogan. Thank you your Excellency, the Right.

But, very much like the Wizard of Oz, the Fed doesn't want you to pay attention to the real issue behind the curtain: Fed officials are enabling profligate government spending that is driving our economic woes - including the new, weaker-than-expected jobs report and uptick in unemployment.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the Federal Reserve has lost its way. Officials don't know why inflation has jumped back up this year or what will happen in the coming months. They left their interest rate target unchanged because of this uncertainty. While Powell mentioned \"uncertainty\" in his remarks, it would be more honest if Fed officials admitted that they really don't know what's going on.\n\nThe Fed has enabled reckless government borrowing - which has shackled us and our children with a mountain of debt that becomes more costly every year. The Federal Reserve began increasing its balance sheet after the 2008 financial crisis, meaning they increased the money supply to make borrowing cheaper and easier. This enabled the government to spend like a drunken sailor and suffer no consequences. In that time, the federal debt grew to an unbelievable $23 trillion!\n\nFED HOLDS RATES STEADY AS INFLATION CASTS DOUBT ON FUTURE CUTS\n\nNormally, when governments borrow insane sums of money, interest rates rise and make additional borrowing inordinately expensive. The only reason the Biden administration has been able to add over $6 trillion to the national debt is because the Federal Reserve creates so much liquidity with its balance sheet.\n\nAlthough Fed officials do their best to present their decisions as reasonable and data-driven, some of their policies are quite destructive. For example, they announced on May 1 that they would slow the reduction of their balance sheet. Yet the Fed's balance sheet is still enormous - roughly $7.5 trillion. That's down from a peak of $8.9 trillion a few years ago.\n\nThe Fed began shrinking its balance sheet in August 2022 by allowing maturing securities to \"roll-off\" the balance sheet instead of being reinvested. This \"balance sheet normalization\" plan allowed up to $35 billion of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and up to $60 billion of Treasury securities to \"roll-off\" the balance sheet each month.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWhile this plan reduced the size of their balance sheet by $1.5 trillion over the past 20 months, it remains large at $7.4 trillion. Yet Fed officials decided to slow the balance sheet reductions by $35 billion per month. In effect, the Fed has reduced the pace of quantitative tightening by 50% or more. At this new pace, the balance sheet would still be a whopping $6.9 trillion by the end of next year.\n\nThere is nothing \"normal\" about that.\n\nWhile Powell mentioned \"uncertainty\" in his remarks, it would be more honest if Fed officials admitted that they really don't know what's going on.\n\nThe Fed's balance sheet was less than a trillion dollars for most of its history. In January 2020, their balance sheet was \"only\" $4.5 trillion or so. This means that after another year and a half of \"balance sheet normalization,\" their balance sheet will still be about $2.5 trillion higher than it was before the pandemic - a 50% increase on an already large number!\n\nFed officials seem oblivious or unconcerned about the massive growth of the Fed's balance sheet over the past two decades. Calling this policy \"balance sheet normalization\" is an exercise in doublespeak.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAllowing the Fed to maintain its huge balance sheet gives them permission to bailout banks and other financial institutions with impunity. They suffered no consequences and people barely batted an eye when they created $400 billion in liquidity to \"stabilize\" the financial system in 2023.\n\nAnd their bloated balance sheet will enable the continued alarming growth of federal debt. Interest payments on the national debt are already larger than our military spending. It's only a matter of time before Fed-enabled Washington profligacy will become so expensive that Draconian budget cuts to infrastructure, defense, Social Security and Medicare become inevitable.\n\nEven today, we are already experiencing persistent inflation as a direct result of such wanton government spending and loose Fed policy. Every time you go to the supermarket or the gas station, you're literally paying for these bad policies.\n\nWe need to constrain the Federal Reserve and force it to accelerate the pace of its balance sheet \"normalization\" if we want to see a return to fiscal sanity.\n\nPaul Mueller, PhD, is a senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research.", "source": {"uri": "foxbusiness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carney_(Delaware_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Carney (Delaware politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agency debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2021/11/1024/512/iStock-1217728849-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551056", "eventUri": "eng-9551056", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 175, "textEnd": 180, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 3209, "textEnd": 3221}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Mueller compared Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the \"Wizard of Oz\" in trying to appear very calm and optimistic while, behind the curtain (figuratively speaking), the serious issue of unsustainable government spending lurks, causing economic catastrophe.\n\nThe economic crises under which America suffers, illustrated by the \"weaker-than-expected jobs report\" and increased unemployment, are driven by federal spending enabled by the Federal Reserve, according to Mueller. The Federal Reserve has an unchanged interest rate target and appears to have no idea what it is doing or should do, Mueller added.\n\nHe wrote, \"The Fed has enabled reckless government borrowing - which has shackled us and our children with a mountain of debt that becomes more costly every year. The Federal Reserve began increasing its balance sheet after the 2008 financial crisis, meaning they increased the money supply to make borrowing cheaper and easier.\" This decision then \"enabled the government to spend like a drunken sailor and suffer no consequences. In that time, the federal debt grew to an unbelievable $23 trillion!\"\n\nThe national debt is now above $34 trillion, and the government has to spend $1 trillion annually just to service the debt. Indeed, the only economic \"growth\" under Biden is government spending -- i.e., government (and thus taxpayer) debt. The American taxpayer simply cannot sustain that -- we're headed for economic catastrophe.\n\nThe Fed began shrinking its balance sheet in August 2022 by allowing maturing securities to \"roll-off\" the balance sheet instead of being reinvested.

As noted above, it's now much higher. The Fed has not since been addressing this problem sufficiently, seeming to either ignore it or see it as less of a threat than it is.

It's a policy.\n\nThe money supply (M2) has bounced to March 2023 levels and has been rising almost every month since October last year. Furthermore, U.S. government deficit spending has more than offset the decline in the Federal Reserve balance sheet. While the Fed's balance sheet has shrunk by $1.5 trillion from its peak, the U.S. government deficit remains above $1.5 trillion per year.\n\nSo, the money supply (M2) in the United States has bounced above March 2023 levels, while deficit spending offsets any Fed balance sheet reduction.\n\nIt is no surprise to read that the Federal Reserve has kept rates unchanged. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that there are no rate hikes on the horizon, which was received with relief by market participants, but he also cast doubt about the expectations of rate cuts. However, the single most surprising message came when the chairman announced that the Fed would delay the quantitative tightening process.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement presents an otherwise optimistic economic outlook, which is at odds with this message. Why would the Fed need to slow down the pace of balance sheet reduction in a strong economy with solid unemployment, consumption, and growth figures?\n\nThe answer may lie in the Treasury yield curve. The FOMC issued this statement in a week in which the two-year Treasury yield touched the dangerous 5 percent level. On previous occasions, such a rise in government debt yields led to a significant market correction. However, the Fed is not as concerned about a market correction as it is about maintaining some calm in the bond market amid an unsustainable increase in government deficit and public debt.\n\nThe Fed is choosing to keep the sovereign debt bubble alive as a priority over reducing inflation.\n\nIt is impossible to reduce inflation to the 2 percent target when the government deficit, which is printing new currency, remains out of control. It is even more difficult when the Federal Reserve delays normalization of the balance sheet, bringing the monthly redemptions to less than half the previous figure.\n\nWith this move, it is no surprise that the two-year yield fell to 4.8 percent and the 10-year slumped to 4.5 percent from 4.7 percent at the end of April.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is reluctant to admit two things: the Treasury's debt supply is significantly higher than private sector demand, and the Fed is more concerned about a bond market meltdown than elevated inflation.\n\nIf the two-year bond yield rises above 5 percent and the 10-year yield soars, we could see a dramatic correction in a market that continues to build elevated risks under the expectation that the Fed will bail everyone out.\n\nA bond market slump would bring down the entire deck of cards in a complacent market.\n\nThe decision of the Fed comes when the global demand for Treasuries is under question. Foreign holdings of Treasuries have risen to an all-time high, but the figure is misleading. Demand has weakened relative to the supply of new bonds. In fact, an expected surge in new issuances by the Treasury creates a headache for the Federal Reserve. Borrowing will be significantly more expensive when public debt interest payments have reached $1 trillion, and investor demand remains robust but not enough to keep pace with an out-of-control deficit.\n\nChina's holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds have fallen for two consecutive months to $775 billion, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and Japan's weak yen may need a Bank of Japan intervention to sell U.S. reserves, which means disposing of Treasury bonds.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve's economic outlook was as solid as stated and the solvency of the public accounts was robust, they would not be announcing a drastic reduction in the path of normalization. They would have accelerated it, given the high and persistent inflation.\n\nThe message that the FOMC statement sends to the world is that the U.S. public finances are completely uncontrolled and that there is not enough demand for the insane increase in the supply of new government bonds.\n\nWhen the Fed keeps rates on hold and delays balance sheet normalization, it achieves two negatives. The full negative impact of rate hikes falls on the shoulders of the private sector, families, and businesses, and the balance sheet management keeps the public debt bubble artificially inflated, leading to more persistent inflation.\n\nIn summary, the Fed's decision could be seen as a dangerous way to keep the government's misguided fiscal policy alive at the expense of making families and small businesses poorer with elevated inflation and higher-for-longer rates. Mr. Powell is trying to be prudent and rigorous about inflation while the government fuels the fire. Mr. Powell is like a fireman trying to stop a fire with a bucket of water, while the owner of the building throws gallons of gasoline over the ceiling.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bond market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_tightening", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative tightening"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget_balance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government budget balance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yield curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solvency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solvency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/01/id5641583-Federal-reserve-GettyImages-2150464945-LSedit-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551056", "eventUri": "eng-9551056", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The Fed has since the summer of 2022 been allowing its holdings to contract as part of a broader effort to make monetary policy more restrictive.\n\nFrom the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020 the Fed doubled the size of its holdings to $9 trillion on very aggressive buying of Treasury and mortgage bonds. It's been allowing up to $95 billion to run off each month, which has taken Fed holdings down to $7.5 trillion. At the FOMC meeting officials said the cap on Treasury bonds' runoff would move from $65 billion to $25 billion. Chair Jerome Powell said he expects this new formula to result in around $40 billion per month in balance sheet reduction.\n\nThe Fed is trying to drain enough liquidity from the financial system to allow for normal money market volatility and firm control over the federal funds rate, its chief lever to influence the economy's momentum. In slowing the pace of the drawdown, the Fed is also trying to avoid the events of September 2019, when markets endured unexpected stress during the last chapter of balance sheet reduction.\n\nIn his remarks, Perli said the final destination for the Fed's balance sheet remains unknown right now. A recent New York Fed report suggested Fed holdings may fall to between $6 trillion to $6.5 trillion based on the market's demand for bank reserves.\n\nHe also offered some guideposts for how the Fed is watching markets for signs liquidity is tightening in a way that would call for an end to what's commonly referred to as quantitative tightening, or QT.\n\nPerli said he's watching \"domestic bank activity in federal funds, the timing of interbank payments, the amount of daylight overdrafts, and the share of repo volume trading at or above the [interest on reserve balances]\" rate.\n\n(Reporting by Michael S.

Financial markets were unsurprised to see that the US central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5%. But while the decision everyone waited for was the day's main event, the FOMC statement and Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting press conference were the critical attractions for Wall Street, Main Street, and the White House.\n\nStocks were little changed when the Fed issued its final decision. Markets even shrugged off the Eccles Building's move to slow the pace of its balance sheet runoff campaign (more on that later). However, minutes into Powell's press conference, equities soared higher than a SpaceX rocket. Why? There was one statement that traders were waiting for him to utter: \"I think it's unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a hike. I'd say it's unlikely.\"\n\nWhen reporters asked Powell what he and his team would need to see to entertain the idea of a rate increase, he responded: \"I think we'd need to see persuasive evidence that our policy stance is not sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation sustainably down to 2% over time. That's not what we think we're seeing.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Fed chief admitted that the central bank is not gaining \"greater confidence\" that inflation is progressing this year, meaning that it will likely \"take longer than previously expected\" to bring inflation back down the entity's 2% target rate. The Fed, Powell noted, is ready to keep policy restrictive \"for as long as appropriate.\"\n\nBecause he insisted that no rate hikes were coming and that the peak in the tightening cycle had been reached, the leading benchmark indexes soared as much as 1.4% before paring most of these gains. Still, it was a testament to how powerful the Fed is and how a few words can ignite a rally or trigger a crash. It was a stunning moment to observe in real-time.\n\nA second wave of inflation appears to be crashing into America's shores. In the first three months of 2024, various inflation readings, from the consumer price index (CPI) to the employment cost index (ECI), have topped estimates. Could the CPI exceed 4% or 5% this year? While the US government does not think so, some private-sector economists suggest that it is in the realm of possibility. Regardless, the central bank is uninterested in a rate hike. Who can blame them? An election is happening in November!\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published an article full of unnamed sources and a supposed \"top secret\" memo that suggested former President Donald Trump intends to transform the Federal Reserve System by eliminating its so-called independence. The newspaper asserted that Trump would essentially install himself on the Fed board and coordinate monetary policy with the central bank. Trump's top economic advisors dismissed this reporting.\n\nThat said, Powell was asked about the Fed's decision-making process in an election year. He dismissed political events and noted that the 2024 election \"just isn't part of our thinking,\" adding that \"it's not what we're hired to do.\" Ultimately, the central bank will guide policy based on what is best for the economy, not politics.\n\n\"It's hard enough to get the economics right here,\" Powell said. \"These are difficult things, and if we were to take on a whole other set of factors and use that as a new filter, it would reduce the likelihood we'd actually get the economics right.\"\n\nOf course, the Federal Reserve maintains a long history of working with the White House, from Marriner Eccles and FDR to Arthur Burns and Richard Nixon to Alan Greenspan and Bill Clinton. Even Powell fell victim to Trump's demands for rate cuts in 2019 when it was not warranted. And yet, the mainstream media and central bankers carry on with this charade of autonomy.\n\nWere the monetary authorities bracing the financial markets for shifts in the balance sheet? In recent weeks, a chorus of officials, whether Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan or Fed Gov. Christopher Waller, had hinted that it would be time to slow the pace of quantitative tightening, also known to the cool kids of finance as QT.\n\nSince March 2022, the central bank has been offloading $95 billion monthly in holdings - $60 billion in Treasurys and $35 billion in agency debt and mortgage-backed securities. The two-year effort effectively lowered the balance sheet by approximately $1.5 trillion, from $8.9 trillion to $7.4 trillion. But now the FOMC wants to decelerate, assess market conditions, and ensure it is not disrupting the money markets. As of June 1, the Fed will be tapering QT by reducing the monthly Treasury declines by $35 billion to $25 billion (mortgage-backed securities will remain the same).\n\nHere is the full statement:\n\n\"The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities. Beginning in June, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $60 billion to $25 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities at $35 billion and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\"\n\nThe real reason, of course, is that the Fed is uncomfortable with government bond yields flirting with 5%. So far, the move was insufficient to pressure Treasury yields. While there was a sea of red ink across the US bond market, they turned positive toward the May 1 closing bell. The benchmark ten-year yield picked up a few basis points to 4.62%, while the two-year added 1.5 basis points to 4.954%.\n\nWashington is ostensibly relieved because it could result in less funding needed in the third quarter, meaning the Treasury might not issue as many short-term debt securities (officials recently estimated they would sell about $850 billion in bonds during the FY 2024 third quarter). Does this mean the Fed is ready to bail out the Treasury again? Time will tell. But the real story might be how quick everyone has been to forget the history of the balance sheet.\n\nAt the start of the global financial crisis, the balance sheet was below $1 trillion. The Fed bailed everyone out, even years following the Great Recession. Then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke insisted to lawmakers that the balance sheet would eventually be lower than where it was prior to the economic collapse. The coronavirus pandemic occurred, and the balance sheet popped to nearly $9 trillion. Today, Powell and Co. suggested this will never happen.\n\nStagflation - a combination of stagnating growth, high unemployment, and rising inflation - is not on the mind of Jerome Powell. In fact, he delivered a quip that had the business media in the room laughing. \"I don't really understand where that's coming from,\" Powell said. \"I don't see the 'stag' or the '-flation.'\" Of course, the Fed did not see the inflation bomb exploding in America, going as far as calling it transitory. In December, Powell gave investors an early Christmas present out of nowhere by shapeshifting from hawk to dove and declaring that rate cuts were coming. Essentially, there was no inflation threat. A few months later, the US is on the brink of an inflation revival, a plethora of statistics suggest the economy is slowing, and consumers are struggling from a toxic mix of higher prices and soaring borrowing costs. If the Fed is dismissive of stagflation, then maybe the concern is justified.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_moran@libertynation.com", "name": "Andrew Moran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eccles Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agency debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriner_S._Eccles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marriner S.

The house of the accused, identified as Brijesh Prajapati (30), in Panwar village in Sidhi district was demolished by a bulldozer by the local administration. The house was found to be built illegally on government land, a senior district officer said. The houses of the three accomplices of the accused would also be bulldozed very soon, the officer said. According to the police, Brajesh used to lay traps on his victims by luring them with the promise of releasing their scholarship funds. He used a voice-changing app and posed as a woman college professor from an institution in Tikari in the district while asking them on phone to meet \u2018her\u2019 to complete necessary paperwork to get the scholarship money. He would then cook up a story by telling them that \u2018her\u2019 son would pick them up on his bike to get them to \u2018her\u2019 home. Brajesh himself would then ride a bike by wearing helmet and hand gloves to pick the girls at the designated place and take them to a deserted area to rape them, police said. The accused used to robe his alleged victims of their mobile phones and cash after committing the crime, police said. Brajesh along with three of his associates, Lavkush, Rahul and Sandeep Prajapati, was arrested and as many as 16 mobile phones were seized from them, Rewa range inspector general (IG) Mahendra Singh Sikarwar said.

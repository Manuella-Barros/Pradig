What can she do?", "text": "Still Standing by my Friend Related: \u2018I\u2019m weary of repeating myself\u2019: How do I deal with rich friends who take $22,000 cruises and book $800 hotel rooms? Dear Still Standing, If there was a cure for jealousy, the person who invented it would be as rich as your friend. Here\u2019s the harsh and ugly truth: The more your friend has, the more her friends realize they don\u2019t have. In America, people worship celebrities, scroll through Vogue online to ogle and comment on the lifestyles of the rich and famous, and organize parties for awards ceremonies like the Academy Awards. But if our next-door neighbor buys the latest Tesla TSLA, +0.79%, adds an elaborate extension to their home or builds a swimming pool in their backyard, tongues will start wagging: \u201cWhere did they get that money? Who do they think they are? So tacky!\u201d If you are happy, truly happy, with what you have, you\u2019re not going to be as susceptible to feelings of envy and jealousy if a friend has a sudden windfall, earned or not. Some people might recommend that you see other people\u2019s success as a motivator. But that merely perpetuates the cycle. Ask any person who gave up their pursuit of money for a life in the country, and got tired of the rat race: Guess what\u2019s behind that door to more prestige and money? Another door. There will always be more to strive for. As the philosopher Alain de Botton writes in his book, \u201cStatus Anxiety,\u201d we don\u2019t compare ourselves with the rich and famous or, generally, hate them for their wealth. We save our ire for people like us: \u201cOur sense of an appropriate limit to anything \u2014 for example, to wealth and esteem \u2014 is never decided independently. It is decided by comparing our condition with that of a reference group, with that of people we consider to be our equals. We cannot appreciate what we have in isolation, nor be judged against the lives of our medieval forbearers.\u201d If we live in a cottage on a vast estate \u201cand yet we observe that all our equals live as we do, then our condition will seem normal; regrettable, certainly, but not fertile ground for a sense of envy,\u201d he writes. \u201cIf we have a pleasant home and comfortable job, however, but learn through ill-advised attendance at a school reunion that some of our old friends (there is no stronger reference group) are now living in houses larger than our own, bought on the proceeds of more enticing occupations, we are likely to return home nursing a violent sense of misfortune.\u201d Your friend\u2019s closest friend may easily browse the mansions of British royalty or Hollywood stars, actually feel uplifted by the glamor and even imagine herself descending a grand staircase in a diaphanous peignoir, but she is less likely to give your friend the same free pass. If she gets a tour of your friend\u2019s new mansion? Heaven help her in this market. \u201cIt is the feeling that we might be something other than what we are \u2014 a feeling transmitted by the superior achievements of those we take to be our equals \u2014 that generates anxiety and resentment,\u201d de Botton adds. Gossip, lies \u2014 and money Gossip and lies can ruin a friendship, but so can money \u2014 and not just because of the green-eyed monster. More than one-fifth of people in this study released last month by Bread Financial, a financial-services company, said they had lost a friendship over money, while more than a quarter acknowledged feeling financially incompatible with their friends. Friendships can deteriorate over time if one friend wants to eat in five-star restaurants and take regular vacations to Europe, and the other friend needs to be at work at 9 a.m. \u201cMoney is not the be-all, end-all of any friendship, but it can play a significant role between even the best of friends,\u201d says Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, a behavioral-finance expert and consultant to Bread Financial. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean people from different financial backgrounds or [differences in] how they choose to spend their money can\u2019t have meaningful connections. However, to develop and sustain strong friendships where money is a recurring factor, it\u2019s crucial to have open money conversations, including setting clear financial boundaries and discussing money goals.\u201d If you win $1 million or $100 million, it\u2019s best to remain anonymous for a variety of reasons, including the effect it will have on your friends, family and even your personal security. But that\u2019s not always possible. New York State, for example, typically requires that lottery winners are part of the public record because the New York Lottery is a government agency. This man wrote to the Moneyist in 2021; he said he won $55 million and kept it secret, even from his family. \u201cI also do not believe in loaning money to friends and relatives, no matter what,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, there are certain exceptions and avenues for maintaining anonymity,\u201d according to the Law Offices of Jay S. Knispel. \u201cFor instance, winners can establish a trust or use legal entities to claim their prize on their behalf, thereby concealing their identity from the public eye. Additionally, recent legislative efforts in New York have been made to provide lottery winners with greater privacy protections. The New York legislature has recognized the importance of safeguarding lottery winners\u2019 identities.\u201d So why doesn\u2019t your newly minted friend talk to her absent friends, and ask them why they don\u2019t return her calls? There\u2019s one thing that is more compelling and attractive than all the money in the world, and that\u2019s truthfulness and vulnerability. Whether you have a million bucks or store all your wealth in library books, we all have the same amount of time on this planet, the same feelings and the same needs. It\u2019s one thing to allow a friendship to die on the vine for reasons that are not clear to you, but I believe it will make your friend feel better if she fights for it.

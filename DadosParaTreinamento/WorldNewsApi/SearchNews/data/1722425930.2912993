Pei reshaped Hong Kong\u2019s skyline with a jagged tower of steel and glass, the Chinese-American architect is once again the talk of the town as a museum celebrates his life and legacy. From the controversial Louvre Pyramid in Paris to the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong, Pei created world landmarks that blended modernity with history, often using stark structures and sharp lines. His work earned the 1983 Pritzker Prize, considered architecture\u2019s Nobel. Of his nearly 50 designs in the United States and abroad, more than half won major awards. \u201cHe had a unique career\u2026 having been able to work with world leaders and do buildings of significance,\u201d his son Sandi Pei told AFP. \u201cThe projects that he did are of a consequence, a scale and a reputation that is very difficult to match.\u201d Pei, who died in 2019 at age 102, is the focus of a retrospective at Hong Kong\u2019s M+ museum that opens Saturday after seven years of preparation. The exhibit features over 400 objects, from original drawings and photographs to architectural models and Pei\u2019s trademark round glasses. Pei became a household name in the United States after being commissioned for the John F. Kennedy Library in 1964, with the president\u2019s widow reportedly won over by Pei\u2019s charisma. His star rose even further when French president Francois Mitterrand in 1981 tapped Pei for the Grand Louvre project, with his design for a giant glass pyramid infuriating Parisians at first. \u201cMy father was very charming,\u201d said Sandi, also an architect. \u201cHe always said you don\u2019t pick your projects, you pick your clients \u2014 but not everybody can pick Francois Mitterrand or Jacqueline Kennedy.\u201d \u2018Community\u2019 via architecture Born in southern China in 1917, banker\u2019s son Ieoh Ming Pei spent his childhood in Hong Kong before moving to the United States in his late teens to study architecture. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University\u2019s Graduate School of Design, Pei began his career working for a real estate developer. Pei\u2019s cross-cultural heritage had been an asset, bringing Chinese elements of \u201cfamily, community and landscape\u201d to the West \u2014 paired with a love for early modernist art and sculpture, according to Sandi. His early urban housing projects honed his method, emphasising each location\u2019s \u201ctime, place and purpose\u201d over ostentatious style. \u201cOne of the things that I did learn from my father is you just don\u2019t come with an idea and plop it onto the site,\u201d Sandi said. \u201cThe design comes from within.\u201d In the 1980s, Sandi worked with his father on the Bank of China Tower, a design made up of four triangular shafts with a blade-like silhouette \u2014 which continues to stand out amid Hong Kong\u2019s forest of high-rises. Pei is also admired in China. He set up a scholarship fund for Chinese students to study the craft in the United States, on the condition they return home to design and build. Chinese architects today can still draw lessons from Pei\u2019s thoughtful, analytical approach, said Sandi, adding that the country holds great potential. But construction often moves forward at breakneck pace and \u201cChina needs to slow down, be more careful and deliberate,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cThey will find that the buildings (that are) better built will last longer, serve their communities better and will not be so wasteful of resources.\u201d Despite being larger-than-life monuments, Pei\u2019s works are about harmony between a community and its environment, Sandi said \u2014 an aspect highlighted in the Hong Kong show. \u201cThat\u2019s why his buildings will continue to survive and be appreciated, because I think people enjoy being within them, because he enjoyed the opportunity to bring community together through his architecture.\u201d Support HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps Help safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by supporting our team", "summary": "<figure><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-1024x576.jpg\" class=\"attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image\" alt=\"IM Pei exhibition\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-1050x591.jpg 1050w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-400x225.jpg 400w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-706x397.jpg 706w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition-800x450.jpg 800w, https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 34.9rem) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 53rem) calc(8 * (100vw / 12)), (min-width: 53rem) calc(6 * (100vw / 12)), 100vw\" /></figure>By Holmes", "url": "https://hongkongfp.com/2024/06/29/i-m-pei-reshaped-hong-kongs-skyline-now-his-life-and-legacy-are-on-display-at-m-museum/", "image": "https://hongkongfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IM-Pei-exhibition.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:30:00", "author": "AFP", "authors": ["AFP"], "language": "en", "source_country": "hk", "sentiment": 0.555}

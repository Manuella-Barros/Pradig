Robertson, who impressed last season, is a fans' favourite and scored during their Pyramid play-off final defeat against Stranraer at the end of last season. But Kilby posted on X a sad Emoji with the message 'Thanks for everything Robbo...' alongside a video of one of his goals from last season, which caused mild panic amongst their fans. Mick Kennedy's club then left supporters hanging before posting: '... enjoy the rest of your stay! \"East Kilbride FC are delighted to announce that John Robertson has committed to the club for another season, signing a one-year extension\".

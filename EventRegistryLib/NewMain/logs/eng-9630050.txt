For example, the 30-year fixed rate is 6.64%, according to Zillow data. This is only three basis points lower than yesterday but a full 52 points lower than this time last week.\n\nIf you're otherwise ready, this may be a good time to buy a house. Rates have ticked down, but they aren't expected to drastically plummet for the rest of the year.\n\nBut if you're in no rush to buy, you could wait until closer to the end of 2025. Rates should be lower by then, and you can use the year to save more for a down payment, pay down debts, and improve your credit score -- all of which could land you an even lower interest rate.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to our latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember that these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nMost mortgage rates are down today -- in fact, 15-year fixed, 30-year FHA, 30-year VA, and 15-year VA loan rates are all 6% or lower.\n\nA mortgage interest rate is a fee for borrowing money from your lender, expressed as a percentage. There are two basic types of mortgage rates: fixed rates and adjustable rates.\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage locks in your rate for the entire life of your loan. For example, if you get a 30-year mortgage with a 6.75% interest rate, your rate will stay at 6.75% for the entire 30 years. (Unless you refinance or sell the home.)\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for the first few years, then changes it periodically. Let's say you get a 5/1 ARM with an introductory rate of 6%. Your rate would be 6% for the first five years, then the rate would increase or decrease once per year for the last 25 years of your term. Whether your rate goes up or down depends on several factors, such as the economy and housing market.\n\nAt the beginning of your mortgage term, most of your monthly payment goes toward interest. As time goes on, less of your payment goes toward interest, and more goes toward the mortgage principal or the amount you originally borrowed.\n\nWhat factors impact your mortgage rate?\n\nThere are two categories of factors that affect your mortgage rate: ones you can control and ones you cannot control.\n\nWhat factors can you control? First, you can compare the best mortgage lenders to find the one that gives you the lowest rate and fees.\n\nSecond, lenders typically extend lower rates to people with higher credit scores, lower debt-to-income ratios, and considerable down payments. If you can save more or pay down debt, a lender will probably give you a better mortgage rate.\n\nRead more: The best mortgage lenders for first-time home buyers\n\nWhat factors can you not control? In short, the economy.\n\nWe could probably write a book about how the economy impacts mortgage rates, but here are the basic details. If the economy -- think employment rates, for example -- is struggling, mortgage rates go down to encourage borrowing, which helps boost the economy. If the economy is strong, mortgage rates go up to temper spending.\n\nDig deeper: What the Fed rate decision means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\n\n30-year vs. 15-year fixed mortgage rates\n\nTwo of the most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Both lock in your rate for the entire loan term.\n\nA 30-year mortgage is popular because it has relatively low monthly payments. But it comes with a higher interest rate than shorter terms, and because you're accumulating interest for three decades, you'll pay a lot of interest in the long run.\n\nA 15-year mortgage can be great because it has a lower rate than you'll get with longer terms, you'll pay less in interest over the years. You'll also pay off your mortgage much faster. But because you're paying off the same loan amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher.\n\nBasically, 30-year mortgages are more affordable from month to month, while 15-year mortgages are cheaper in the long run.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 6.56%, which is a decrease of -0.07% since last week. For a look at mortgage rate movement, see the chart below.\n\nGiven that inflation data hasn't been improving, the Federal Reserve has been pushing off rate cuts. Though mortgage rates could still move down later in the year, housing market predictions change regularly in response to economic data, geopolitical events and more.\n\nMortgage rates are expected to slowly decline in 2024.

This tool features partner rates from lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates.\n\nEach mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.\n\nFor a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, the average rate you'll pay is 7.06% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you'll have a lower monthly payment.\n\nToday, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 6.56%. Though you'll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.\n\nA 5/1 ARM has an average rate of 6.62% today. You'll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.\n\nOver the last few years, high inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes pushed up mortgage rates from their record lows around the pandemic. Since last summer, the Fed has consistently kept the federal funds rate at 5.25% to 5.5%. Though the central bank doesn't directly set the rates for mortgages, a high federal funds rate makes borrowing more expensive, including for home loans.\n\nMortgage rates change daily, but average rates have been moving between 6.5% and 7.5% since late last fall. Today's homebuyers have less room in their budget to afford the cost of a home due to elevated mortgage rates and steep home prices. Limited housing inventory and low wage growth are also contributing to the affordability crisis and keeping mortgage demand down.\n\nMost housing market experts predict rates will end the year between 6% and 6.5%. Ultimately, a more affordable mortgage market will depend on how quickly the Fed begins cutting interest rates. The central bank could start lowering interest rates in the fall, but it will depend on how the economy fares in the coming months.\n\nMortgage rates fluctuate for many reasons: supply, demand, inflation, monetary policy, jobs data and market expectations. Homebuyers won't see lower rates overnight, and it's unlikely there will ever be a return to the 2-3% mortgage rates we saw between 2000 and early 2022.\n\n\"We are expecting mortgage rates to fall to around 6.5% by the end of this year, but there's still a lot of volatility I think we might see,\" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin.\n\nEvery month brings a new set of inflation and labor data that can influence the direction of mortgage rates, said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. \"Ongoing inflation deceleration, a slowing economy and even geopolitical uncertainty can contribute to lower mortgage rates. On the other hand, data that signals upside risk to inflation may result in higher rates,\" Kushi said.\n\nHere's a look at where some major housing authorities expect average mortgage rates to land.\n\nGetting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. CNET's mortgage calculator below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments.\n\nThough mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won't be unaffordable forever.

You would pay around $57,523 in total interest over the life of the loan.\n\nToday's average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage fell 0.18 point from last week to 7.38%.\n\nBorrowers with a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 7.38% will pay approximately $691 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $5,183.\n\nEveryone's budget and financial goals vary. How much house you can afford comes down to a number of factors, including what you earn and what you owe. You'll also want to consider how much you want to save for retirement, school and other expenses down the road.\n\nHere are a few basic factors that go into what you can afford:\n\nHome loan borrowers can qualify for better mortgage rates by having good or excellent credit, maintaining a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and pursuing loan programs that don't charge mortgage insurance premiums or similar ongoing charges that increase the loan's annual percentage rate (APR).\n\nComparing rates from different mortgage lenders is an excellent starting point. You may also compare conventional, first-time homebuyer and government-backed programs like FHA and VA loans, which have different rates and fees.\n\nFor the most part, several economic factors influence the trajectory of rates for new home loans. The recent Federal Reserve rate hikes don't directly cause mortgage rates to rise but have indirectly caused the interest rates for many long-term loans to increase.

A look at 2024 and 2025.", "body": "Since late 2022, mortgage rates have jumped between 6% and 7% -- and in fall 2023, they nearly eclipsed 8%, marking the highest 30-year mortgage rate seen in over two decades.\n\nCombined with rising home prices, higher rates have sent mortgage payments soaring. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the median monthly mortgage payment on new home purchases is now $2,256 -- up almost 7% from a year ago. The jump has sidelined many home buyers and deterred existing homeowners from selling (about 9 in 10 have current rates under 6% and may not want to let go of that lower rate).\n\nIt raises the question: Just how long can these higher rates last? And when, if at all, can consumers expect mortgage rates to go down enough for monthly payments to become a little more manageable? Here's what we know.\n\nTo gauge when mortgage rates will go down, it's important to understand why they increased in the first place.\n\nFor the most part, it has to do with inflation. As inflation rose, the Federal Reserve pushed up its interest rates to tamp down spending. The central bank increased its benchmark federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks borrow money from each other -- 11 times throughout 2022 and 2023, raising it from nearly 0% to the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, where it sits today. Mortgage rates aren't directly tied to the Fed rate, but when it rises, mortgage rates tend to increase too.\n\nWhile the Fed's moves have largely been successful at lowering inflation, it hasn't been enough. The April 2024 inflation rate came in at 3.4% year over year -- well above the central bank's 2% goal. As a result, the Fed has been keeping its higher interest rates in hopes of lowering inflation even further.\n\nAnd those higher-for-longer rates are keeping current mortgage rates up too. Until the Fed decides inflation is under control and starts to reduce its benchmark rate, mortgage interest rates are likely to remain high, experts say.\n\n\"In order to see rates improve, we need to see inflation numbers decreasing, new job creations slow down, and potentially unemployment filings to increase,\" said Evan Luchaco, a home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Portland, Ore., via email. \"These are all economic signs of a slowdown that will spur the Fed to take action in lowering the Fed funds rate, which will have a trickle-down effect to lower mortgage rates.\"\n\nLuchaco expected this could start happening toward the end of the year, though that's not set in stone. Currently, the CME FedWatch Tool, which uses investing activity to predict future Fed moves, shows a small rate cut is likely at the bank's September meeting, with more potential rate cuts to follow.\n\n\"In order for rates to come down, we need to see inflation ease,\" said Jennifer Beeston, senior vice president of mortgage lending at Guaranteed Rate, via email. \"Based on current economic predictors, that looks like potentially fall; however, all the predictions have been wrong for the last two years.\"\n\nNo crystal ball will tell us when rates will drop, and rate predictions largely depend on who you ask.\n\nHere's a look at where two major industry players project mortgage rates will be over the next couple of years:\n\nAs you can see, both predict rates will drop over the coming year or two, but very gradually. Experts also don't expect any drastic dips in rates -- say to 3% or 4%, as experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"A significant drop in rates would only happen if the U.S. went into a deep recession,\" said Neil Christiansen, a home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Denver, in an email. \"If the Fed sees the economy slowing and stalling, then they could cut rates drastically to jump-start it, but the way things are going, I don't see a significant cut in rates anytime soon.\"\n\nRates are likely to fall over the next couple of years, but not by a huge amount. So, is it worth it to hold out for lower rates? The answer is different for everyone, but to start, run the numbers.\n\n\"For people waiting for rates to come down, I often show the payment now versus a percent lower,\" Beeston said. \"They are often shocked by how little the difference is. The impact of a rate drop on your payment is far more dramatic at a $1 million purchase than a $100,000 one.\"\n\nBelow is an example of what a rate drop may mean for your payment toward a mortgage principal and interest on a $250,000, $500,000, or $1 million mortgage.\n\nBeyond this, you should also think about housing market conditions. Though lower mortgage rates could shave a little off your monthly payment, there may be more competition for properties when rates fall. This could cause home prices to increase and result in bidding wars (which also drive up prices).\n\nAs Luchaco explained, \"Home prices aren't likely to come down in any significant way, and while rates may decline, this will likely only lead to more people getting into the market and creating greater demand for housing -- pushing home prices up all over again.\"\n\nThat's why most experts recommend buying a home when the time -- and numbers -- work for you. If you need to get out of the rent race and can qualify for a rate and payment you can afford, pull the trigger, experts say. You can plan to refinance if rates drop later on.\n\n\"From where I sit, the cost of waiting will continue to hurt the buyer, even in today's rate environment,\" Christiansen said. \"Home prices continue to increase at 5% to 6% year over year, and with the loss in appreciation and loan pay-down, the longer the buyer waits, the more they lose the opportunity to improve their net worth.\"\n\nIf you buy sooner rather than later, you have a chance to start building home equity.\n\nDig deeper: Is now a good time to buy a house?\n\nWhile average 30-year fixed mortgage rates sit around 7% right now, the exact rate you'll get on a mortgage depends on many factors, like your loan amount, credit score, mortgage lender, and more.\n\nTo ensure you're getting the best mortgage rate possible, compare mortgage lenders. Get a loan estimate from each, and see how rates and fees measure up. According to Freddie Mac, shopping around can save you between $600 and $1,200 per year.\n\nYou can also work on improving your credit score since borrowers with higher scores tend to get lower interest rates.\n\nFinally, consider an interest rate buydown. When you buy down your rate, you either permanently or temporarily lower your interest rate in exchange for an up-front fee on closing day. Talk to your mortgage loan officer if you're interested in this strategy.\n\nLearn more: 5 strategies to get the lowest mortgage rates\n\nMortgage rates could fall in 2024, but that's not a given.

Interest rates have likely risen since you first locked in your rate, which can put additional pressure on your monthly budget.\n\nEveryone's circumstances are different, which is why it's important to speak with a mortgage broker who can ensure any advice is tailored to your needs. The good news is that there are various options to ensure you are in the best position when it comes to remortgaging and can keep your mortgage affordable despite higher rates.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to understand the reasons behind the service charge increase. Request a detailed breakdown from your property management company. If the increase seems unjustified, you may have grounds to challenge it through a leasehold advisory service.\n\nAs your fixed-rate mortgage term comes to an end, it's important to start planning early for remortgaging. Begin by reviewing your financial situation and adjusting your budget to accommodate the higher service charge and the higher mortgage monthly commitment. This might involve cutting back on non-essential expenses or building a financial cushion to prepare for the potential increase in your mortgage payments.\n\nImproving your credit score can also enhance your chances of securing a favorable remortgage deal. Ensure all your debts are paid on time and avoid taking on new credit commitments.\n\nBegin researching remortgage options about six months before your current deal ends. This gives you plenty of time to explore different lenders and mortgage products, ensuring you find a competitive rate while also adjusting your expenditure. Starting early helps you avoid any last-minute rush and potential gaps in your mortgage coverage. It also puts you in the best position to change the mortgage terms should rates reduce between your application and the end of your fixed deal.\n\nUsing a mortgage broker can be a valuable resource and will likely save you time and money. Brokers have access to a wide range of mortgage products and can offer tailored advice based on your specific financial situation. They may also have access to exclusive deals not available directly to consumers.\n\nA good broker can help you navigate the mortgage market and choose between fixed, variable, or tracker mortgages based on your financial plans and risk tolerance.\n\nThere are various ways to reduce costs, ranging from extending the mortgage term - though keep in mind the longer the term, the more interest you will pay - to part repayment and part interest-only options. Each choice comes with its risks, but with the right advice, you can ensure your mortgage remains affordable and tailored to your needs and circumstances.\n\nWhile the prospect of higher mortgage payments can be stressful, proactive planning and professional advice can significantly ease the transition. By assessing your financial situation, improving your credit score, and exploring various mortgage products, you can secure a remortgage deal that fits your needs.\n\nDon't let the fear of higher mortgage payments overwhelm you. With careful planning and the right advice, you can find a remortgage solution that ensures your financial stability and peace of mind.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leasehold estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk aversion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_207566579-1200x630-pl-money-clinic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Discover How This Spike Is Shaking Up the Housing Market!", "body": "7.03% Mortgage Rates?! Discover How This Spike Is Shaking Up the Housing Market!\n\nThe mortgage market has reached a historic low, reminiscent of the early 2000s when people were still adjusting to writing the year with a \"20\" instead of a \"19.\" According to real estate data provider ATTOM Data, lenders issued only 1.28 million home loans of any kind in the first quarter of 2024, marking a nearly 7% decrease from the previous quarter and the fewest since the year 2000. This total includes home purchase mortgages, refinances, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC), underscoring the significant impact of high mortgage rates on the housing market.\n\nThe Impact of High Mortgage Rates\n\nThe current average rate of 7.03% for a 30-year mortgage, more than double the 2.65% record low of 2021, has driven up borrowing costs to unaffordable levels for many potential homebuyers. This steep increase in rates has made refinancing or even selling a home unappealing for homeowners who secured lower rates during the pandemic. High interest rates have effectively stifled the housing market, reducing both the demand for new mortgages and the supply of homes for sale.\n\nPotential for a Second-Quarter Turnaround\n\nThere is a glimmer of hope for a potential turnaround in the second quarter of 2024, given the increase in lending activity during the peak home-buying season of 2023. However, the outlook remains cautious. With little indication that interest rates will decrease significantly, the potential for a substantial rebound in refinance and HELOC lending remains limited. Additionally, the supply of homes for sale shows no signs of increasing, further dampening prospects for a significant market recovery.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's Influence\n\nThe trajectory of mortgage rates has been closely tied to the Federal Reserve's actions. In 2020, the Fed slashed its influential fed funds rateThe Fed Funds Rate is the rate at which member banks of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) lend each other money, usually for overnight loans. More to near zero to stimulate the economy during the pandemic-induced downturn. This move led to a plunge in mortgage rates, which reached record lows. However, as the economy began to recover and inflation concerns grew, the Fed embarked on a campaign of rate hikes in 2022, causing mortgage rates to climb back up.\n\nFuture Rate Cuts: A Hopeful Yet Uncertain Prospect\n\nFinancial markets are hopeful for rate cuts starting in September 2024 if economic data between now and then indicate that inflation and economic activity are cooling. Fed officials have emphasized that they will not cut rates until they are confident that inflation is firmly on a downward path to their 2% annual target from its current level of 2.7%. The decision to cut rates will depend heavily on the economic data in the coming months, adding an element of uncertainty to the mortgage market's future direction.\n\nHistorical Perspective on Mortgage Rates\n\nTo understand the current mortgage rate environment, it is helpful to look back at the historical trends. Mortgage rates started the 2010s around 5.09% and steadily declined, reaching around 3.35% by the end of 2012. In 2013, rates rose due to the Fed's announcement of plans to reduce bond purchases, peaking at 4.53% in early 2014 before declining again to 3.59% by February 2015.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, mortgage rates began rising, fluctuating between around 3.5% and 4.9% until the end of 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused rates to plummet, with the 30-year fixed rate averaging just 2.67% by the end of that year as the Fed cut rates to near zero. Rates remained low around 3% through 2021. However, in March 2022, the Fed began aggressively raising rates to combat inflation, causing mortgage rates to spike. By October 2022, the 30-year fixed rate had reached over 7%, the highest since 2002.\n\nThe Current Mortgage Rate Environment\n\nAs of late May 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was around 7.03%, according to data from Freddie Mac. Rates continued to climb in 2023, even breaking above 8% by October, according to Bankrate data. This sustained increase in rates has had a profound impact on the mortgage market, contributing to the historic low in mortgage activity observed in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nThe current state of the mortgage market reflects the complex interplay of high interest rates, economic conditions, and Federal Reserve policies. While there is potential for some improvement in lending activity in the second quarter of 2024, significant challenges remain. The path forward for the mortgage market will depend heavily on future economic data and the Federal Reserve's actions. Homebuyers, homeowners, and lenders alike will need to navigate this uncertain landscape with caution and adaptability.", "source": {"uri": "guerillastocktrading.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guerilla Stock Trading"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lance_jepsen@guerillastocktrading.com", "name": "Lance Jepsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discover_Card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discover Card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.guerillastocktrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mortgage-rates-2010-to-2024.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-02-", "textStart": 3329, "textEnd": 3342}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

That's in addition to the 2% qualifying rate as set out by the Government of Canada, making it more difficult for seniors to obtain institutional funding. Many seniors are unable to borrow under the standard mortgage rules because of these combined policies.\"\n\nAge and risk management\n\nObtaining a mortgage as a senior can be a daunting challenge in two ways: firstly, with the reduction of the amortization period based on age with some lenders, and secondly, the extra 2% added to their interest rate. Green says, \"These measures, while justifiable under the guise of risk management, significantly hinder seniors' ability to secure a mortgage if they need the funds.\"\n\nFor younger applicants, banks typically offer amortization periods from 25 to 30 years. However, for seniors, the amortization period can be drastically reduced to 10 or 15 years, significantly increasing the monthly payments. The imposition of an additional 2% interest rate compounds the financial strain. Even though the equity in their home may be $1,000,000, they may not qualify for a $300,000 mortgage to buy a vacation home or help their children buy their own home. This often leaves seniors turning to private mortgages which come with higher interest rates. But Tracy Green says there are alternative solutions.\n\nThe benefits of a reverse mortgage\n\nReverse mortgages offer a unique flexibility that many may not be aware of. Green says, \"Many people think that a reverse mortgage means that they're giving their house away. They don't realize that they can make mortgage payments on a reverse mortgage to maintain the equity in their home.\"\n\nBy making regular payments, homeowners can cover the interest or a portion of the interest and even reduce the principal by up to 10% annually, maintaining or growing their equity stake in the property as values rise over time. Green says, \"This approach allows older homeowners to enjoy the liquidity of a reverse mortgage while safeguarding the value of their home. A reverse mortgage does not have to mean that the homeowner is taking equity out while the interest is accumulating, and they'll eventually have nothing left. A homeowner can make full payment which over the full term will not take any equity out of the property or they can make partial payments to slow the erosion of equity.\"\n\nHomeowners can also take advantage of the \"no payment at all\" option and take lump sums as needed rather than all at once. It works like a line of credit, with some restrictions.\n\nAs property values increase, a home's equity will appreciate. A reverse mortgage with the option of making monthly mortgage payments slows or eliminates equity erosion, capitalizes on rising property values, and gives older homeowners peace of mind.\n\nA 5-year mortgage payment pause\n\nA program that offers a 5-year pause on monthly mortgage payments may sound like a financial fantasy, but Tracy Green says it's a viable option for many, regardless of their age. \"Up to 45% of the home's value can be put on a 5-year, no payment program. While the interest accumulates over the 5 years, if the homeowner wants to sell or refinance early, they can do that with no penalties.\"\n\nThe program is designed for homeowners who need a break from making full mortgage payments because they are returning to school, or they may be struggling financially and want to wait to see if interest rates decline. As home values rise and they age, they may then qualify for a reverse mortgage that can be held as long as they want. The program is open to homeowners of any age who can't afford their mortgage payments and are considering selling.\n\nNavigating the complexities of mortgage financing can be challenging, especially when traditional mortgages from a bank are out of reach. There are alternative options that can provide significant financial relief. Tracy Green and her team at Ontario-Wide Financial can access a wide range of mortgage options and tailor solutions to the clients' specific needs.\n\nContact: Tracy Green (416) 573-7669/1-888-307-7799 Mortgage Broker/Owner Level 2 FSRA License # 12456 or visit: www.ontario-widefinancial.com.", "source": {"uri": "orilliamatters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OrilliaMatters.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(accounting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amortization (accounting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reverse mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinancing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 54}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Homeowner Associations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/orilliamatters/spotlight-images/ontario-wide-financial/adobestock_688248364.jpeg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

With conventional mortgage rates averaging about six percent during the 1920s, it would only have taken an annual income of $1,540 to afford the monthly mortgage payment for such a home. Well over half the Americans who filed income tax returns that year could easily afford to buy that new home.\n\nOne hundred years later, with interest rates for conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgages hovering at seven percent, April 2024 saw the affordability of new homes remain out of reach for most American households. Mainly because the typical new home sold has become much more costly, but also because mortgage rates are higher. Even so, new homes were last as relatively affordable as they were in 1924 for a majority of American households in the months from May 2019 through March 2021.\n\nThe initial estimate of the median sale price for a new home in April 2024 is $433,500. With an estimated median household income of $77,760, the monthly mortgage payment for a new home would consume 44.5% of the income earned by a typical American household.\n\nThat is well above the long-established 28/36 rule that most traditional mortgage lenders use to determine the maximum amount of money they will lend to home buyers.\n\nThose thresholds are shown in the following chart, which also verifies that new homes have been consistently above that upper affordability threshold for more than half of American households starting in April 2022.\n\nSpeaking of elevated mortgage rates, we now have 53 full years worth of monthly average mortgage rates in the United States. We've made that data available in the following interactive chart, if you're accessing this article on a site that republishes our RSS news feed, you may need to click through to our site to access the fully-functional chart, which is also accessible here and at Datawrapper.\n\nThe average interest rate for a conventional fixed-rate 30-year mortgage in May 2024 is 7.06%, which is slightly higher than the 6.99% average for April 2024. We anticipate the relative affordability of new homes in May 2024 will be similar to what it has been in recent months. Which is to say that most American households will continue to not be able to afford to buy a new home anytime soon.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. New Residential Sales Historical Data.

Here's Why -- and Which States Have the Lowest Rates.", "body": "As with everything in real estate, where you live also has an impact on what kind of mortgage rate you can get.\n\nIt's a challenging housing market for home buyers, with home prices at an all-time high and mortgage rates above 7%. Eagle-eyed house hunters may notice a difference when they search mortgage-rate quotes online, depending on the state that they are looking in.\n\nThere's a good reason for that: Mortgage rates vary by state, and can differ as much as 38 basis points, according to data provided to MarketWatch by data and consulting company Curinos.\n\n\"Not all markets are created equal,\" Rich Martin, director of real-estate lending at Curinos, told MarketWatch in an interview. \"Real estate is local.\"\n\nThe company, which works with multiple lenders, surveyed 100 lenders across the country for their rates on 30-year mortgages, as well as 40 lenders on their rates for second-lien mortgages, typically a home-equity line of credit. The analysis looked at rates for all borrowers, regardless of their credit scores.\n\nRates varied considerably by location. In Hawaii, a home buyer would be quoted a rate as low as 6.49%, while in Vermont, they'd be quoted a rate up to 6.88% -- the highest among all states.\n\nAssuming a 20% down payment on a $400,000 home, the higher rate would translate to a $2,103 monthly payment, while the lower rate would mean a $2,020 monthly payment. That's nearly $30,000 in additional interest paid over the lifetime of the loan.\n\nThe variation between states depends on several factors, experts told MarketWatch.\n\nRates vary due to the credit quality of the borrowers in that state, Martin said. Typically, the higher the credit score of the borrower, the better the loan terms -- including the mortgage rate. So if borrowers in a given state typically have lower credit scores, that affects the overall rate.\n\nThe variance in rates between states could also be due to how savvy consumers are in that state, Martin added. The more that borrowers shop around for a quote, the better their rate tends to be. If borrowers ask multiple lenders for quotes on their mortgage rate, they could save an average of $76,410 over the lifetime of their loans, according to a recent report by LendingTree. In Hawaii -- where mortgage rates were the lowest in the nation on average, according to Curinos data -- shopping around for additional quotes could save a borrower $115,947 over the lifetime of their loan, LendingTree found.\n\nThe divergence in rates could also depend on how many lenders a market has, and how competitive they are. For instance, if there are more types of financial institutions -- from credit unions to banks both big and small -- and they're competing for the same pool of home buyers, that could lead to lower rates, Martin noted.\n\nRegulatory and legal differences between states may also lead to lower mortgage rates in some parts of the U.S. \"There are differences in state law regarding the foreclosure process, for example,\" Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae, told MarketWatch.\n\nIn states that have a judicial process for foreclosures, for instance, the lender has to file a lawsuit in court in order to foreclose on a house after the borrower stops paying the mortgage for a certain period.\n\n\"The timeline is much longer, so the risk to the lender is greater,\" Duncan explained. \"So they charge a higher risk premium up front, which could lead to a higher mortgage rate.\"\n\nOn the other hand, in states with a nonjudicial foreclosure process, the lender has a shorter and more predictable timeline, which correlates to a lower mortgage rate. In administrative states, that process is more programmed, more predictable and faster, which would also correlate to a lower mortgage rate.\n\nTo be sure, Hawaii, the state with the lowest mortgage rates, has a combination of both types of foreclosure. North Dakota, with the second-lowest rates, follows a judicial foreclosure process, while Nevada, which has the third-lowest rates, follows a nonjudicial process.", "source": {"uri": "realtor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realtor.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aarthi_swaminathan@realtor.com", "name": "Aarthi Swaminathan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreclosure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreclosure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_premium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk premium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fannie Mae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://na.rdcpix.com/271fd189d070353a380d3536fcb42339w-c4217261925srd_q80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

That comes, to a great extent, from much earlier client contact procedures, in part down to the Mortgage Charter and the commitment lenders must make to provide \"well-timed information to help customers plan ahead should their current rate be due to end\".\n\nIf this is six months ahead, then clients could have options for a product transfer (PT) at that point, which we would hope they then bring to their adviser to ascertain if it's right for them.\n\nThe point being, of course, that six months is a long time to run before the mortgage deal ends, with the potential for constant change, and constant work with the requirement for multiple applications on just one case.\n\nWe've certainly seen this in our data.\n\nApplication numbers being strong, however we know that brokers across the industry can be involved in two, three, four, even six, applications for one client between original advice and completion, and only one is going to generate income.\n\nClearly, this 'duplicate' work is still highly important for the client. Six months ago, for instance, the lending landscape and product options available were very different, and much more expensive than they have been in recent weeks, certainly through the early weeks of the year.\n\nAdvisers may well have been able to save their clients thousands of pounds on their overall mortgage costs by continuing to keep up to date on product changes, shift them to new rates and carry out the work necessary to get them the cheaper product.\n\nHowever, this has meant they have been incredibly busy, and obviously, they only get paid for one completion, not all the multiple applications they have to get involved in.\n\nAdd in this extra work for mortgage advice, and you can see why advisers might not have had the time or resource to give to their ancillary work, particularly protection, which is such an important provision for the consumer.\n\nTo be included among this, of course, is the recent dominance of PT business, and the fact the procuration fee tends to be less when compared to remortgage - although we hope the recent rate changes make remortgaging more attractive this year.\n\nThere will also be other risks to income, not least the 'cost of business living', and the fact last year saw much lower market volumes, which will not have helped any advisory firm.\n\nThese risks do not sit in isolation in any mortgage advice firm, instead they coalesce and combine and present a variety of challenges that cannot be ignored, because they impact individual adviser productivity and the income achievable.", "source": {"uri": "mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mortgage Solutions"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shekina_tuahene@mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "name": "Shekina Tuahene", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_Party_(Brazil)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workers' Party (Brazil)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home_Based", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Home Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2022/12/Rob-Clifford-Stonebridge-CEO.jpg-2022-scaled-764x399-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Sellers who locked in a low mortgage rate before the pandemic began have been reluctant to sell, leaving few options for eager would-be buyers.\n\nAMERICANS WITH ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGES COULD SOON SEE THEIR PAYMENTS SKYROCKET\n\nWhile the median listing price is mostly unchanged from the same time last year, higher mortgage rates compared with May 2023 have increased the monthly cost of financing a typical home by about $158 per month, or 7.1%.\n\nThat means in order to purchase a median-priced home, income needs to increase by $6,400 to $119,700.\n\n\"While the housing market is still in the seller's territory, it is expected to shift in a buyer-friendly direction as mortgage rates resume their decline over the next year and the number of homes for sale increases. Already, the housing market has taken steps in this direction,\" Hale and Speianu wrote.\n\nEconomists predict that mortgage rates will remain elevated for most of 2024 and that they will only begin to fall once the Federal Reserve starts cutting rates. Even then, rates are unlikely to return to the lows seen during the pandemic, with investors predicting just one or two rate reductions this year.\n\nMortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on a 30-year loan rose slightly to 7.04%. While that is down from a peak of 7.79% in the fall, it remains sharply higher than the pandemic-era lows of just 3%.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nMost homeowners say they are nearly twice as willing to sell their home if their mortgage rate is 5% or higher, according to a Zillow survey.

But an ominous threat has since resurfaced: \"zombie mortgages\". These second mortgages, many of which were acquired in the time leading up to the late-2000s housing crisis, have become problematic for thousands of homeowners, and some are now facing threats of collections and foreclosure from creditors who say they are owed money on old home loans tied to the properties.\n\nThese \"zombie\" debts often arise when a homeowner falls behind on mortgage payments and vacates the home, assuming the bank will proceed with foreclosure. But with home values tanking during the most recent housing crisis, many lenders who held delinquent mortgage loans opted not to take the final steps to foreclose and take legal possession. And now, seemingly out of the blue, homeowners are receiving notices that they owe a remaining balance on those old mortgage loans, plus accumulated fees, penalties, taxes and maintenance costs.\n\nHomeowners who find themselves plagued by tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in zombie mortgage debt may see their credit scores shattered and finances ruined, making it difficult to secure future housing, qualify for loans or, in some cases, even get hired for certain jobs. Foreclosure is also a real threat in these circumstances, as are repercussions like wage garnishment and asset seizure. But while zombie mortgages truly are a serious affliction, there are ways to pay off the mortgage loan debt if you're dealing with this issue.\n\nCompare the home equity options you have and start tackling your \"zombie mortgage\" debt now.\n\nIf you're trying to get rid of a zombie mortgage, here are some of the top options you have for paying off what's owed on the home:\n\nThe average U.S. homeowner is now sitting on about $300,000 in home equity thanks to rapidly rising property values over the last few years, and about $190,000 of that is tappable home equity. Borrowing from this home equity can be a powerful financial weapon against zombie mortgage debts.\n\nFor example, if you have enough equity in your home, you can leverage it responsibly to cure delinquent mortgage payments before the foreclosure process goes too far. Or, if you're facing an existing \"zombie mortgage,\" you can use the home equity funds for an outright payoff to permanently eliminate the debt obligation once and for all.\n\nYou have a couple of good options for curing a zombie mortgage with your home equity: a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC). And, even in today's high-rate environment, these borrowing options can be more affordable than other types of lending, as the average rate on a home equity loan is currently 8.60% while the average HELOC rate is just over 9%.\n\nA home equity loan functions like a second mortgage, providing a lump sum of money at a fixed interest rate that is repaid over a set term. HELOCs are more flexible, acting as revolving credit lines that can be drawn from as needed, with variable interest rates charged only on the outstanding balance. But either one can be a smart way to access the cash you need to get rid of your mortgage debt and retain ownership of your home.\n\nFind out how your home equity could help you get rid of your zombie mortgage loan.\n\nIn situations where the overall \"zombie mortgage\" debt amount seems questionable or unaffordable, it may be worth attempting to negotiate a lump-sum settlement with the mortgage holder. That's because creditors are often willing to accept a discounted payoff figure for less than the full mortgage loan balance to close out the file and recover at least a portion of what is owed, especially if the mortgage debt is old.\n\nThat said, this process often takes patience, skilled negotiating and (ideally) some guidance from a real estate attorney or housing counselor. After all, the nuances of this type of negotiation, as well as the legalities related to collecting on these types of debts, can be confusing to a layperson. But if successful, it could provide significant savings compared to paying the full \"zombie mortgage\" amount to keep your home.\n\nThere are cases where zombie mortgage claims will be inaccurate, whether that means they contain incorrect information, excessive fees or amounts that are simply not legitimate. Or, in certain situations, the debt from a former owner, rather than the current homeowner, may be tied to a lien placed on the property.\n\nIn these scenarios, homeowners have the right under federal law to issue a formal written dispute requesting validation and supporting evidence for any questionable charges. If the lender is unable to produce proper documentation proving the full debt is accurate and owed, portions or even all of the \"zombie mortgage\" may potentially be discharged through this dispute process. So, it can be worth disputing the debt if there are questions as to whether it's collectible or valid, as it could result in paying a lot less (or nothing) on the old mortgage debt.\n\nWhen all other options for resolving a zombie mortgage have been exhausted and the debt is overwhelming, filing for bankruptcy can serve as a last-resort measure to discharge the obligation. Both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy filings can potentially eliminate mortgage debts through the courts.\n\nHowever, it's important to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney first, as this solution comes with damaging credit consequences and borrowing limitations that can persist for years. In most cases, bankruptcy should only be pursued if there are simply no other viable paths for resolving the \"zombie mortgage.\"\n\nWhile \"zombie mortgages\" represent a truly threatening financial affliction, the situation is not hopeless if you are proactive in exploring all available remedies. By utilizing strategies like leveraging home equity, negotiating affordable solutions or even considering bankruptcy when necessary, you can put these debts down for good and regain control over your housing future.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home equity line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreclosure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreclosure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zombie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Second mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home equity loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garnishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_forfeiture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asset forfeiture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolving credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_7,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lien", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lien"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home_Buyers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Home Buyers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/06/06/0affa87c-1a29-4525-8ad2-00f20096ae24/thumbnail/1200x630/a05b92417a6fa65e31643249a9934123/gettyimages-1063372734.jpg?v=6d480a252670b63de1e37fef02c977a5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Today, however, with mortgage rates being much higher, borrowers must qualify at their offered interest rate plus two percentage points.", "source": {"uri": "edmontonjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Edmonton Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_test_(financial)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stress test (financial)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Superintendent_of_Financial_Institutions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/edmontonjournal/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/0525-sp-market-sp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

For , the average was 6.71%\n\nRates on the 15-year FRM also fell to 6.29% from 6.36% week-to-week, but was up from 6.07% one year ago.\n\n\"Rates are just shy of 7%, and over the remainder of 2024,\" Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said in a press release. \"If a potential buyer is looking to buy a home this year, waiting for lower rates may result in small savings, but shopping around for the best rate remains tremendously beneficial.\"\n\nData from Lender Price posted on the National Mortgage News website at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday had the 30-year FRM averaging 6.959%. This compared with 7.275% one week ago.\n\nMeanwhile, rates fell by 23 basis points on the 30-year FRM as tracked by Zillow. As of 11:30 a.m. eastern time on Thursday morning, they were down to 6.58% from an average of 6.81% for the prior week.\n\nThis erased the 30 basis point rise that took place in late May.\n\n\"Personal consumption data last week suggested consumer spending is slowing down,\" Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow Home Loans, said in a Wednesday evening statement. \"At the same time, manufacturing activity pulled back after a brief rebound last month.\"\n\nThe job openings data from this week suggested considerable loosening in the U.S. labor market. Taken together, all are signs that the economy is cooling and the pace of inflation could slow.\n\n\"While investors expect that further disinflation will lead to Fed rate cuts later this year, a stronger than expected increase in hourly earnings in the May jobs report could cause some repricing activity,\" Divounguy said.\n\nIn a recent meeting with the editorial staff at National Mortgage News, Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said he expects two rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year, one in September and the other in December. That puts Fannie Mae's estimate for where rates will end the year in the 7% range.\n\nWhen Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell says higher for longer, the market has two ways to interpret that statement, he said.\n\n\"One is they will keep the current Fed funds target where it is for a long time period,\" said Duncan. \"The other one is when they do decide to ease, is they might ease more gradually and less far than you would have expected.\"\n\nFannie Mae's economists are in both camps, he added.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, one of the influences on mortgage pricing, was at 4.29% at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time, down from a close of 4.55% one week earlier. This is the lowest the 10-year has been since April 1.\n\nAnother component on mortgage pricing is the primary market-secondary market spreads, the difference between the rate on a loan and what a securitization is being priced at.\n\nThose spreads widened in late April as publicly traded mortgage lenders reported earnings, but are now back down to being roughly flat compared with the first quarter, said Bose George, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a flash note.\n\n\"The April widening appeared to be driven by higher rates, which have also largely come back down,\" George said.\n\nAgency mortgage-backed securities appear to be trading in a tighter spread range compared with the 10-year Treasury swap rate; that range is 170-to-200 basis points in 2024, while in the second half of last year, the upper end was 220 basis points.\n\n\"The main driver of the narrower range appears to be market expectations that the Fed will not raise rates,\" George said.\n\nAnother influence on this is what the banks are doing, especially given\n\n\"Bank holdings of agency MBS have grown moderately from the lows in October and banks are no longer a technical negative,\" George said. \"While Fed holdings of agency MBS continue to run down, the pace has been muted, reflecting slow prepayments.\"", "source": {"uri": "nationalmortgagenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Mortgage News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fannie Mae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-rate_mortgage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fixed-rate mortgage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securitization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Securitization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage-backed security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2b495f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2813+0+413/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F09%2F7f%2F2a89882f45e18e42e7c9b50b63f2%2Fhomes-for-sale.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630050", "eventUri": "eng-9630050", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 231}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 2829, "textEnd": 2836}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

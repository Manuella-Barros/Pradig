Authorities found the mother of three's badly beaten body in a 4-foot hole in a heavily wooded area along Brays Bayou the day after she didn't return home from a run.\n\nBurton confessed to attempting to rape Adleman and strangling her with her own shoelaces and later told a prison psychologist that the murder was \"just something I couldn't help,\" according to court records. He was found guilty by a Texas jury in June 1998.\n\nIf his execution moves forward, Burton will be the third inmate put to death in Texas this year and the 11th in the nation.\n\nAs Burton's execution nears, USA TODAY is looking back at the crime, who Burton is, and what led him down a path that ended with Adleman's murder.\n\nWhat did Arthur Lee Burton do?\n\nNancy Adleman left her northwest Houston home around 7 p.m. on July 29, 1997, to go on a short jog along Brays Bayou, something she did often. It was the last time her family saw her.\n\nWhen Harris County deputies found Adleman's body the next morning, her shorts and underwear had been removed and discarded, according to court records.\n\nBurton, who was arrested 10 days later, originally denied killing the mother of three. But once a Harris County deputy sheriff confronted Burton about evidence found at the scene and the inconsistencies in his statements, the 27-year-old confessed, court records show.\n\nIn Burton's written statement, he admitted to attacking Adleman, dragging her into the woods, choking her unconscious and removing her shorts and underwear so he could rape her, according to a 2004 court filing. When Adleman regained consciousness and began screaming, Burton choked her unconscious again and dragged her into a hole.\n\nAs he was about to leave, he saw another person walking nearby, so he returned to the hole and strangled Adleman with her shoelace, the document says.\n\n\"For any woman who has ever exercised alone, or walked to their car alone at night, this case is their worst nightmare,\" Josh Reiss, chief of the Post-Conviction Writ Division of the Harris County District Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY.\n\nWho is Arthur Lee Burton?\n\nDuring Burton's murder trial, prosecutors painted him as a man who had committed 39 burglaries in a single month when he was 18, court records show\n\nProsecutors said Burton and his co-defendants had stolen guns, radios, fishing equipment, calculators and other items. Burton's brother, Michael Burton, testified in 2002 that his brother started using marijuana at the age of 16 and began selling cocaine when he was 17.\n\nMichael Burton also said their father was not a part of their lives and recalled periods when they were on welfare as children, sometimes going without food or electricity, according to a federal appeals document filed by the state in 2010.\n\nMichael Burton testified that his brother was common-law married, had three children and a stepchild, and was a hard-working, \"good father.\" He said he never knew his brother to be violent or abusive.\n\nFannie Burton, Burton's mother, testified that her son \"loved to build things,\" while his common-law wife of eight years, Felicia Batts, said he was a \"very sweet person who treated her son like he was his own.\"\n\nBatts told the jury that nothing out of the ordinary happened a week before the killing that would have angered Burton. She also said that he came home on the night of the murder with a flat tire on his bicycle and that he was \"laughing and seemed normal.\"\n\nIs Arthur Lee Burton a 'future danger' to society?\n\nIn Burton's earlier appeals, his attorneys questioned whether the evidence presented in court during his murder and sentencing trials was enough to determine if he was a \"future danger\" to society. If not, then that may not constitute the death penalty under Texas law, his defense attorneys argued.\n\nBurton's attorneys also claimed that the trial court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when the prosecution admitted statements made during his interview with prison sociologist J.P. Guyton. The defense attorneys called Guyton's testimony \"hearsay\" and said their client's comments were made without a Miranda warning or counsel.\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals continued to deny Burton's appeals despite his attorney's concerns regarding his case. Burton was sentenced to death twice, in June 1998 and September 2002. His initial conviction was upheld, but his sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nBurton's recent appeal, filed on July 19, addresses inconsistencies in the death warrant copies. Judge Ramona Franklin agreed with Burton's attorneys and recalled the death warrant. But the Texax Court of Criminal Appeals restored Burton's execution on July 30 after agreeing that the state \"individually signed and certified\" each death warrant, therefore it did comply with state statutes.\n\nBurton's attorneys filed another appeal on July 30, arguing that the state does not have the right to take the life of an \"intellectually disabled\" offender. This appeal was denied on Aug. 1, thus ending Burton's state court proceedings.\n\nKathryn Johnson, Burton's attorney, recently told USA TODAY that her client has his family and friends supporting him as he tries to get through this process.\n\n\"It is certainly a very hard experience for him and for his family, as well dealing with the uncertainty that comes into play,\" she said.", "source":

The 48-year-old mother of three was beaten and strangled with her own shoelace in a heavily wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou, police said. According to authorities, Burton confessed to killing Adleman, saying \"she asked me why was I doing it and that I didn\u00b4t have to do it.\" Burton recanted this confession at trial.\n\nBurton, now 54, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.\n\nLower courts rejected his petition for a stay, so his lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop his execution.\n\nHis lawyers argued that reports by two experts as well as a review of records show Burton \"exhibited low scores on tests of learning, reasoning, comprehending complex ideas, problem solving, and suggestibility, all of which are examples of significant limitations in intellectual functioning.\"\n\nRecords show Burton scored \"significantly below\" grade-level on standardized testing and had difficulty performing daily activities like cooking and cleaning, according to the petition.\n\nThis photo provided by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice shows death row inmate Arthur Lee Burton, who was condemned for the July 1997 killing of Nancy Adleman and faces execution Wednesday evening, Aug. 7, 2024, at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. (Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP)\n\n\"This court\u00b4s intervention is urgently needed to prevent the imminent execution of Mr. Burton, who the unrebutted evidence strongly indicates is intellectually disabled and therefore categorically exempt from the death penalty,\" Burton\u00b4s lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of intellectually disabled people, but has given states some discretion to decide how to determine such disabilities. Justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.\n\nProsecutors say Burton has not previously raised claims he is intellectually disabled and waited until eight days before his scheduled execution to do so.\n\nAn expert for the Harris County District Attorney\u00b4s Office, which prosecuted Burton, said in an Aug. 1 report that Burton\u00b4s writing and reading abilities \"fall generally at or higher than the average U.S. citizen, which is inconsistent with\" intellectual disability.\n\n\"I have not seen any mental health or other notations that Mr. Burton suffers from a significant deficit in intellectual or mental capabilities,\" according to the report by Thomas Guilmette, a psychology professor at Providence College in Rhode Island.\n\nBurton was convicted in 1998 but his death sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000. He received another death sentence at a new punishment trial in 2002.\n\nIn their petition to the Supreme Court, Burton\u00b4s lawyers accused the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of rejecting their claims of intellectual disability because of \"hostility\" toward prior Supreme Court rulings that criticized the state\u00b4s rules on determining intellectual disability.\n\nIn a February 2019 ruling regarding another death row inmate, the Supreme Court said the Texas appeals court was continuing to rely on factors that have no grounding in prevailing medical practice.\n\nIn a July concurring order denying an intellectual disability claim for another death row inmate, four justices from the Texas appeals court suggested that the standards now used by clinicians and researchers \"could also be the result of bias against the death penalty on the part of those who dictate the standards for intellectual disability.\"\n\nIn a filing to the Supreme Court, the Texas Attorney General\u00b4s Office denied that the state appeals court was refusing to adhere to current criteria for determining intellectual disability.\n\nBurton would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, the nation\u00b4s busiest capital punishment state, and the 11th in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, Taberon Dave Honie was scheduled to be the first inmate executed in Utah since 2010. He was condemned for the 1998 killing of his girlfriend\u00b4s mother.\n\nFollow Juan A.

The defense attorneys called Guyton's testimony \"hearsay\" and said their client's comments were made without a Miranda warning or counsel.\n\nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals continued to deny Burton's appeals despite his attorney's concerns regarding his case. Burton was sentenced to death twice, in June 1998 and September 2002. His initial conviction was upheld, but his sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nBurton's recent appeal, filed on July 19, addresses inconsistencies in the death warrant copies. Judge Ramona Franklin agreed with Burton's attorneys and recalled the death warrant. But the Texax Court of Criminal Appeals restored Burton's execution on July 30 after agreeing that the state \"individually signed and certified\" each death warrant, therefore it did comply with state statutes.\n\nBurton's attorneys filed another appeal on July 30, arguing that the state does not have the right to take the life of an \"intellectually disabled\" offender. This appeal was denied on Aug. 1, thus ending Burton's state court proceedings.\n\nKathryn Johnson, Burton's attorney, recently told USA TODAY that her client has his family and friends supporting him as he tries to get through this process.\n\n\"It is certainly a very hard experience for him and for his family, as well dealing with the uncertainty that comes into play,\" she said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Texas man admitted to killing mother of 3.

The 48-year-old mother of three was beaten and strangled with her own shoelace in a heavily wooded area off a jogging trail along a bayou, police said. According to authorities, Burton confessed to killing Adleman, saying \"she asked me why was I doing it and that I didn't have to do it.\" Burton recanted this confession at trial.\n\nBurton, now 54, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.\n\nLower courts rejected his petition for a stay, so his lawyers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop his execution.\n\nHis lawyers argued that reports by two experts as well as a review of records show Burton \"exhibited low scores on tests of learning, reasoning, comprehending complex ideas, problem solving, and suggestibility, all of which are examples of significant limitations in intellectual functioning.\"\n\nRecords show Burton scored \"significantly below\" grade-level on standardized testing and had difficulty performing daily activities like cooking and cleaning, according to the petition.\n\n\"This court's intervention is urgently needed to prevent the imminent execution of Mr. Burton, who the unrebutted evidence strongly indicates is intellectually disabled and therefore categorically exempt from the death penalty,\" Burton's lawyers wrote.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of intellectually disabled people, but has given states some discretion to decide how to determine such disabilities. Justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.\n\nProsecutors say Burton has not previously raised claims he is intellectually disabled and waited until eight days before his scheduled execution to do so.\n\nAn expert for the Harris County District Attorney's Office, which prosecuted Burton, said in an Aug. 1 report that Burton's writing and reading abilities \"fall generally at or higher than the average U.S. citizen, which is inconsistent with\" intellectual disability.\n\n\"I have not seen any mental health or other notations that Mr. Burton suffers from a significant deficit in intellectual or mental capabilities,\" according to the report by Thomas Guilmette, a psychology professor at Providence College in Rhode Island.\n\nBurton was convicted in 1998 but his death sentence was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in 2000. He received another death sentence at a new punishment trial in 2002.\n\nIn their petition to the Supreme Court, Burton's lawyers accused the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of rejecting their claims of intellectual disability because of \"hostility\" toward prior Supreme Court rulings that criticized the state's rules on determining intellectual disability.\n\nIn a February 2019 ruling regarding another death row inmate, the Supreme Court said the Texas appeals court was continuing to rely on factors that have no grounding in prevailing medical practice.\n\nIn a July concurring order denying an intellectual disability claim for another death row inmate, four justices from the Texas appeals court suggested that the standards now used by clinicians and researchers \"could also be the result of bias against the death penalty on the part of those who dictate the standards for intellectual disability.\"\n\nIn a filing to the Supreme Court, the Texas Attorney General's Office denied that the state appeals court was refusing to adhere to current criteria for determining intellectual disability.\n\nBurton would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, the nation's busiest capital punishment state, and the 11th in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, Taberon Dave Honie was scheduled to be the first inmate executed in Utah since 2010.

Normally she would jog with her husband, this time she went jogging alone,\" said Josh Reiss, a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office. \"She went jogging alone so she could rehearse the lines of her one woman play that she was going to perform at her local church.\"\n\nOn July 29, 1997 Burton saw Adleman jogging along the bayou, ran up behind her and dragged her into a wooded area. Burton tried to sexually assault Adleman, but said he got too \"nervous.\" Burton then strangled her with a shoelace. Burton was arrested after residents in the area recognized a sketch of the attacker circulated by police. Burton lived near the location Adleman was murdered.\n\nMan convicted of murdering jogger in 1997 to be executed in Huntsville Wednesday\n\nBurton originally denied murdering Adleman but then confessed.\n\n\"She was asking me did I know about God. She said I forgive you. She told me to just leave. She asked me why was I doing it and that I didn't have to do it,\" Burton said in his confession.\n\nCourt documents read Burton told a prison psychologist the murder was \"something I just couldn't help.\"\n\n\"This case really is about every woman's worst nightmare. Any woman who has ever exercised alone, any woman who has ever walked out to their car alone at night, this is your worst nightmare,\" said Reiss.\n\nMORE CRIME-RELATED NEWS COVERAGE HERE\n\nBurton was convicted of capital murder in 1998 and sentenced to death. In 2001, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Burton's punishment based on \"ineffective assistance of counsel.\" A second punishment trial was held in 2002 and Burton was again sentenced to die.\n\n\"The death penalty exists for cases like this and for people like Arthur Burton,\" said Reiss. \"I think what made this ultimately a death (penalty) case was to be looking your killer in the eye and saying, 'I forgive you, I forgive you.' That makes this case different.\"\n\nDuring his punishment trials prosecutors told jurors Burton had committed several other crimes.

In Houston, Burton was found guilty of confronting Adleman on a path while she was jogging through her neighborhood near the bayou.\n\nAccording to court records, Burton forced her into a nearby wooded area and was attempting to rape her.\n\nAdleman began to scream as she heard someone approaching the area. Authorities said that Burton began strangling her with her own shoelaces, killing her.\n\nOriginally from Bastrop County, Louisiana, Burton initially denied that he was ever near the area, or killing Adleman. Harris County Deputy Sheriff Benjamin Beall interrogated Burton and found inconsistencies in his story. The appeals documents record the statement of facts that the police discovered Adleman's body the next morning in a hole about three to four feet deep, located in the heavily wooded area off the jogging trail along the bayou.\n\nHer shorts and panties had been removed and discarded some distance away from the body, leading the police to believe that she had been sexually assaulted. Adleman had been strangled with her own shoelace, and her body looked as if she had been badly beaten.\n\nThe court documents also report that in Burton's written statement, he admitted attacking a jogger, dragging her into the woods, and choking her until she was unconscious. He then removed her shorts and underwear and attempted to have sex with her. When she regained consciousness and began screaming, he again choked her into unconsciousness and dragged her into a hole.\n\nBurton's written statement said he began to leave, but when he saw another person walking nearby, he returned and strangled the jogger with her own shoelace.\n\nIn addition to the facts of the crime, the state presented evidence that, in 1988, when Burton was 18, he had participated in 39 burglaries of vehicles and outbuildings in a single month. He and his co-defendants had stolen guns, radios, fishing equipment, calculators, and other items. At times, the group would not take anything; they would just go through any papers in the car and then destroy the inside of the vehicle. Finally, Burton's brother testified that he knew that he used marijuana and sold cocaine when he lived in Arkansas.\n\nIn the early part of May 2024, Burton attended proceedings for his death date in Harris County by teleconference at the Polunsky Unit.\n\nJudge Ramona Franklin signed the execution order and noted that Burton had exhausted all his efforts to avoid death after 26 years on death row.\n\nThe execution of Burton is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 7, at the Huntsville Unit.\n\nContact Brenda Poe at editor@itemonline.com", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "huntsville_item@star-telegram.com", "name": "Huntsville Item", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leonard Adleman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelaces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shoelaces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayou", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bayou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastrop_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bastrop County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bastrop County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_B._Polunsky_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allan B.

Four others are scheduled to die in 2024.\n\nBurton was first sentenced to death in 1998 for killing Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was on a summer evening jog along the bayou near her home in Houston. Police officers discovered her body the next morning in a wooded area near the jogging trail. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelace, her body badly beaten and her shorts and underwear discarded some distance away, according to court documents.\n\nWhen approached by a police officer, Burton initially denied killing Adleman. But he later confessed to the crime and admitted to attacking a jogger, dragging her to the woods and choking her until she was unconscious, according to court documents. Burton has since argued that his confession was coerced.\n\n\"For every woman who has ever exercised alone, or who has walked out to her car alone at night, this case is their worst nightmare,\" said Josh Reiss, chief of the Harris County District Attorney's office division of post-conviction writs.\n\nIn a memoir published in 2019, Sarah Adleman, the victim's daughter, explored the grief of her mother's killing -- which took place while she was a teenager -- and included pieces of her mother's poetry.\n\n\"The morning after she didn't come home I find a baby sparrow in the garden next to the birdbath, under the pine tree,\" she wrote. \"If I can nurse the bird back to health my mother will be OK. I make a home for the bird in a shoebox, cut grapes for it to eat, and keep it on my bedside table for two nights.\"\n\nIn another passage, she wrote of how her mother told her killer that she forgives him, and \"God does too.\"\n\n\"What she did do with her words was open the door to acceptance,\" she wrote. \"Acceptance that life, no matter how hard we try or how hard we fight it, will ever be as it was. Forgiveness comes after.\"\n\nIn Burton's latest appeal, which was still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court as of Wednesday morning, his lawyers argued that he is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty.\n\nIn a petition filed just days before his scheduled execution, Burton presented \"recently-developed evidence\" of his intellectual disability, including an evaluation by a clinical psychologist who found that Burton meets the criteria for \"mild intellectual disability,\" various neuropsychological tests, school records and supporting commentary from seven people who knew him in his adolescence.\n\nThe state rejected Burton's claim, citing a clinical neuropsychologist's evaluation that the \"qualitative and quantitative evidence are not consistent with the presence of intellectual disability.\" The state's report argued that the results of Burton's IQ tests fell several points above the range that indicates a disability, that he appeared to have been a \"very prolific reader\" while on death row and that he has not required additional support to function in the prison system.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that executing someone with an intellectual disability constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Intellectual disability is one of two categorical bars the court has placed on the death penalty. Those who were under 18 at the age of a capital crime are also ineligible for the death penalty, the court has held.\n\n\"It's the law of the land,\" said Kate Johnson, one of Burton's attorneys. \"Mr. Burton is intellectually disabled. The state does not agree. And our view is that we should litigate the issue -- and if he is intellectually disabled, he needs to be resentenced.\"\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Monday afternoon that Burton's petition was not timely, and should have been raised years ago. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also rejected Burton's intellectual disability claim.\n\nBurton's lawyers appealed the state criminal court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second look and stay of his execution. They argued that the state's highest criminal court acted wrongly and failed to follow the latest medical guidance for evaluating intellectual disability.\n\n\"A chasm is once again growing between the medical community's diagnostic framework for intellectual disability and the TCCA's idiosyncratic view about who should be deemed ineligible for execution,\" his lawyers wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court. \"Mr. Burton has fallen into that chasm.

Four others are scheduled to die in 2024.\n\nBurton was first sentenced to death in 1998 for killing Nancy Adleman, a mother of three who was on a summer evening jog along the bayou near her home in Houston. Police officers discovered her body the next morning in a wooded area near the jogging trail. Adleman was strangled with her own shoelace, her body badly beaten and her shorts and underwear discarded some distance away, according to court documents.\n\nWhen approached by a police officer, Burton initially denied killing Adleman. But he later confessed to the crime and admitted to attacking a jogger, dragging her to the woods and choking her until she was unconscious, according to court documents. Burton has since argued that his confession was coerced.\n\n\"For every woman who has ever exercised alone, or who has walked out to her car alone at night, this case is their worst nightmare,\" said Josh Reiss, chief of the Harris County District Attorney's office division of post-conviction writs.\n\nIn a memoir published in 2019, Sarah Adleman, the victim's daughter, explored the grief of her mother's killing -- which took place while she was a teenager -- and included pieces of her mother's poetry.\n\n\"The morning after she didn't come home I find a baby sparrow in the garden next to the birdbath, under the pine tree,\" she wrote. \"If I can nurse the bird back to health my mother will be OK. I make a home for the bird in a shoebox, cut grapes for it to eat, and keep it on my bedside table for two nights.\"\n\nIn another passage, she wrote of how her mother told her killer that she forgives him, and \"God does too.\"\n\n\"What she did do with her words was open the door to acceptance,\" she wrote. \"Acceptance that life, no matter how hard we try or how hard we fight it, will ever be as it was. Forgiveness comes after.\"\n\nIn Burton's latest appeal, which was still pending before the U.S. Supreme Court as of Wednesday morning, his lawyers argued that he is intellectually disabled and thus ineligible for the death penalty.\n\nIn a petition filed just days before his scheduled execution, Burton presented \"recently-developed evidence\" of his intellectual disability, including an evaluation by a clinical psychologist who found that Burton meets the criteria for \"mild intellectual disability,\" various neuropsychological tests, school records and supporting commentary from seven people who knew him in his adolescence.\n\nThe state rejected Burton's claim, citing a clinical neuropsychologist's evaluation that the \"qualitative and quantitative evidence are not consistent with the presence of intellectual disability.\" The state's report argued that the results of Burton's IQ tests fell several points above the range that indicates a disability, that he appeared to have been a \"very prolific reader\" while on death row and that he has not required additional support to function in the prison system.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that executing someone with an intellectual disability constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" Intellectual disability is one of two categorical bars the court has placed on the death penalty. Those who were under 18 at the age of a capital crime are also ineligible for the death penalty, the court has held.\n\n\"It's the law of the land,\" said Kate Johnson, one of Burton's attorneys. \"Mr. Burton is intellectually disabled. The state does not agree. And our view is that we should litigate the issue -- and if he is intellectually disabled, he needs to be resentenced.\"\n\nA three-judge panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Monday afternoon that Burton's petition was not timely, and should have been raised years ago. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also rejected Burton's intellectual disability claim.\n\nBurton's lawyers appealed the state criminal court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court for a second look and stay of his execution. They argued that the state's highest criminal court acted wrongly and failed to follow the latest medical guidance for evaluating intellectual disability.\n\n\"A chasm is once again growing between the medical community's diagnostic framework for intellectual disability and the TCCA's idiosyncratic view about who should be deemed ineligible for execution,\" his lawyers wrote to the U.S. Supreme Court. \"Mr. Burton has fallen into that chasm. Thus, once again, Texas has imposed a test that flouts this Court's precedents.\"", "source": {"uri": "texastribune.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Texas Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_guo@texastribune.org", "name": "Kayla Guo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Texas Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unconsciousness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strangling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession_(religion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confession (religion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiveness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forgiveness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Writ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Johnson_(rower)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kate Johnson (rower)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thumbnails.texastribune.org/As75kHTpEjFpHjFkBBjlhtsfTVU=/1200x630/filters:quality(95)/static.texastribune.org/media/files/11c309da85dd3c08b4828737903fa3fd/0329%20TDCJ%20Chamber%20Screenshot%2007%20TT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796452", "eventUri": "eng-9796452", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

At the time, Mr. Burton was just beginning his television career, having starred in Roots as the protagonist, an enslaved man named Kunta Kinte.\n\nMr. Burton believed in Reading Rainbow so much that he continued to host the show while playing Geordi La Forge in Star Trek. He is credited for his ability to connect with children and speak to them about difficult subjects ranging from slavery, incarceration, homelessness, death, gangs and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nIt was important for Mr. Burton to be authentically himself while on the show because he knew Black youth were watching and looking up to him. He explained to the audience that it used to be illegal for Black people to read in the U.S. and said that even though times have changed, Black people still don't have enough representation in literature.\n\n\"From our enslavement to the stars, I have been able to re-create and represent the experience of Black people and our trajectory on this planet,\" Mr. Burton said. \"LeVar as the Reading Rainbow guy is in the middle of that.\"\n\nReading Rainbow focused on advancing representation and chose books that taught kids about a variety of cultures.\n\nThroughout the duration of Reading Rainbow, the team faced funding threats\n\nMr. Burton spoke to Congress in 1995 about the importance of public broadcasting and its continued funding. He mentioned his two children, and said he hoped the government would support their futures, and in subsequent, their education, by defending programs like Reading Rainbow.\n\nBut when former President George W. Bush's No Child Left Behind Act was passed in 2001, their financial struggles were amplified.\n\nThe show aired its last episode in 2006 because it didn't have the money to continue. Mr. Burton said when the show was canceled, future generations suffered.\n\n\"I just cannot and refuse to believe that we are heading towards a society where reading becomes obsolete,\" Mr. Burton said. \"It makes me sad just thinking about it.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Burton walked onto the Grange Hall stage Sunday, he asked the audience to indicate if they'd seen Reading Rainbow and the whole room raised their hands. He marveled at the sight and said it still amazes him to see so many lives touched by his work.\n\nMr. Burton spoke about the importance of literature of all kinds and he continues to advocate for reading on his LeVar Burton Reads Podcast.\n\nRosemary Stimola, a literary agent who lives on the Island, asked Mr. Burton about his thoughts on book banning. She said she's frustrated by continuously having to turn important books away because her publishers say they won't sell in states like Texas and Florida where banning books looms large.\n\nMr. Burton expressed his dismay for the rise of book banning and said it's of detriment to children.\n\n\"We're banning books and censoring educational material because it makes people uncomfortable,\" Mr. Burton said. \"I've been uncomfortable my whole freaking life. There is no reason to censor history.\"\n\nMr. Burton said there is power in resistance and told the audience to do what they could to ensure that stories that need to be told are shared.\n\n\"There's nothing else to do but do the work,\" Mr. Burton said.\n\nMr. Burton's daughter, actress Mica Burton, was in the audience and told the audience how her father encouraged her to read growing up. She then asked him about the best way to encourage children to read.\n\n\"When parents ask me how to get their child to read more, I ask them 'what is your child passionate about?' It's our passions that tend to drive and dictate our reading appetites.\"\n\nAt the end of the event, Mr. Burton left the audience with a message all too familiar to people who grew-up hearing his voice beam through their living room televisions.\n\n\"If you're a reader for life, then you're a learner for life. And if you're a learner for life, then you are by my definition free because no one will ever be able to imprison your mind.\"", "source": {"uri": "vineyardgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vineyard Gazette - Martha's Vineyard News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Rainbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reading Rainbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeVar_Burton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeVar Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geordi La Forge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunta_Kinte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kunta Kinte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

If that fails, his scheduled execution will take place anywhere from 6 p.m. to midnight.\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice last executed a Harris County death row inmate, Arthur Brown, in March 2023, with state records showing that nearly 70 inmates from the Houston area remain on death row.\n\nTwo executions -- Ivan Cantu from Collin County and Ramiro Gonzales from Medina County -- have been carried out so far in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "houstonchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Huntsville, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huntsville, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Court_of_Criminal_Appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Court of Criminal Appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Franklin, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Department_of_Criminal_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Department of Criminal Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_row", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death row"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medina County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Medina County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzales_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gonzales County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gonzales County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Collin County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/37/24/17/24986613/5/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796452", "eventUri": "eng-9796452", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

He received another death sentence at a new punishment trial in 2002.\n\nIn their petition to the Supreme Court, Burton's lawyers accused the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals of rejecting their claims of intellectual disability because of \"hostility\" toward prior Supreme Court rulings that criticized the state's rules on determining intellectual disability.\n\nIn a February 2019 ruling regarding another death row inmate, the Supreme Court said the Texas appeals court was continuing to rely on factors that have no grounding in prevailing medical practice.\n\nIn a July concurring order denying an intellectual disability claim for another death row inmate, four justices from the Texas appeals court suggested that the standards now used by clinicians and researchers \"could also be the result of bias against the death penalty on the part of those who dictate the standards for intellectual disability.\"\n\nIn a filing to the Supreme Court, the Texas Attorney General's Office denied that the state appeals court was refusing to adhere to current criteria for determining intellectual disability.\n\nBurton would be the third inmate put to death this year in Texas, the nation's busiest capital punishment state, and the 11th in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, Taberon Dave Honie was scheduled to be the first inmate executed in Utah since 2010.

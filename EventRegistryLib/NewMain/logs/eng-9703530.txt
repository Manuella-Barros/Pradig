Fantasy Football Trade Rumors", "body": "Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott put up MVP-caliber numbers in 2023, but he choked in the Wild Card round, ensuring the Cowboys suffered yet another early playoff exit.\n\nHeading into the 2024 season, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones says they are \"all-in.\" But what will come after 2024? Prescott's contract expires at the end of the season, and the two sides haven't made much progress on negotiating a new deal.\n\nWill Dak Prescott be traded? Will he sign an extension with the Dallas Cowboys? What does the future hold for the Cowboys and their franchise quarterback? Let's jump in!\n\nPrescott put up one of the best performances of his career last season and one of the best seasons of any quarterback in the league. He led the league with 36 touchdown passes, posted the second-highest QB rating (105.9), and threw for the third-most yards (4,516) while completing 69.5% of his passes and throwing just nine interceptions.\n\nHe dominated against divisional rivals, leading Dallas to a 5-1 record in the division while throwing for 300.3 yards per game, 17 touchdown passes, and just two interceptions. Critics will point to the fact that three of his four games with four touchdowns came in blowout victories over the basement-dwelling Commanders (twice) and Giants (once), but those wins helped the Cowboys wrap up a division title.\n\nHe played so well that he was considered an MVP candidate and ended up placing second in the voting. Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, however, won 49 of the 50 first-place votes. Prescott finished with just 152 vote points, more than 300 fewer than Jackson.\n\nThe playoffs left a sour taste in the mouths of Cowboys fans, as Prescott threw two early interceptions, including a pick-six, and the Green Bay Packers got out to an early lead. Prescott ended up racking up 403 passing yards as he threw the ball 60 times in an ill-fated attempt to come back. It wouldn't be enough, as the Packers held on to win, 48-32.\n\nRumors abound about the future of Prescott. His contract expires at the end of the season, and Jones has said he wants to keep his star quarterback. But other expensive contracts are coming up, including CeeDee Lamb's and Micah Parsons', so it won't be easy to stay under the salary cap.\n\nThis offseason, the Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions have already locked their quarterbacks into long-term deals, but there has been no news of progress on talks between Prescott and the Cowboys.\n\nPrescott says he is not worried and he is leaving the contract to his agent: \"Yeah, would give it up just to play this game. So I (leave) that to the business people to say what it's worth what they're supposed to give a quarterback of my play. A person of my play, leader of my play.\"\n\nBut if the two sides cannot reach an agreement, will Prescott be traded -- either during or after the season? The answer is most likely not.\n\nPrescott's contract includes a no-trade clause. The Cowboys look to be playoff contenders again this season, so the team wouldn't want to trade him during the season, anyway.\n\nAt the end of the season, Prescott will become a free agent if he does not sign an extension. His contract prevents the Cowboys from using the franchise tag on him. That means that he can hit the open market in 2025.\n\nPrescott finished as the QB3 in 2023. While his passing numbers were superior to Josh Allen's and Jalen Hurts', Allen and Hurts had the edge over Prescott because of their rushing abilities. Patrick Mahomes had a down year due to poor performance from his wide receivers. If the new receiver corps in Kansas City can step up, then Mahomes will likely finish in the top-3 quarterbacks again.\n\nPrescott remains an excellent quarterback, and Lamb is one of the best receivers any quarterback has to throw the ball to. However, Prescott set career highs in most categories last season, and it is not likely he will repeat it.\n\nIn 2022, Prescott finished as the QB18 (while missing four games), and in 2021, he was the QB7. Prescott is certainly a top-12 fantasy quarterback and likely a top-6 quarterback, but he probably won't be in the running for the title of QB1.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mitchell_blatt@rotoballer.com", "name": "Mitchell Blatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_tag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchise tag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2019/08/dak-prescott-fantasy-football-quarterback-rankings-draft-sleepers-icon.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703530", "eventUri": "eng-9703530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

When Prescott was injured in 2020, he was playing on the franchise tag and in the offseason of 2021, he signed a four-year $160 million deal with $126 million guaranteed.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreCowboys rookies most likely to contribute this season: No. 2 Cooper BeebeNFL betting odds: Cowboys' Super Bowl, Micah Parsons DPOY chances, and moreCowboys rookies most likely to contribute this season: No. 3 Marshawn Kneeland\n\nFind more Cowboys coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabo_San_Lucas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabo San Lucas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cabo San Lucas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_tag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchise tag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/GG4EOAH44ZCHZGDGQYAAOQ7M4I.jpg?auth=f083a30080a6114d6aa08dff822356e34c895b9895828a2602c2a660c1c88fe4&height=467&width=830&focal=1447,478&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703530", "eventUri": "eng-9703530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 541, "textEnd": 547}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 685, "textEnd": 692}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

A Dallas team official denied the rumors. Prescott is entering the final year of his contract so an injury could cost him a lot of money.\n\nWhen it comes to the Dallas Cowboys, there's never a shortage of drama. Even now, with the offseason in one of its most quiet periods, people are buzzing about starting quarterback Dak Prescott. This time, it is his health.\n\nThe Ross Tucker Podcast had pro sports bettor Steve Fezzik discussing Dallas in a recent episode. Fezzik said there are rumors that Prescott isn't healthy, which is why people are betting heavily against the Cowboys lately:\n\n\"Dak Prescott...News is, he's not 100%, and they've been betting against the Cowboys the last three days...There's rumors that he had an MRI. That's unconfirmed, but that's the rumors that I'm hearing.\"\n\nIf the rumors are true, that would greatly blow the team's Super Bowl chances. For years, there have been jokes that winning the NFC East is a curse for the next season. As the 2023 division champs, Dallas is trying to dispel that notion in 2024.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The NFC East has gone 19 consecutive seasons without a repeat champion. That is the longest streak without back-to-back titles by any division in NFL history.\n\nA team source has already called the injury claim a waste of time.\n\nRelated Cowboys' VP Claims Dak Prescott Can Still Win Super Bowl\n\nStephen Jones remains confident in the quarterback's ability to lead Dallas to its first title since the 1990s.\n\nDak Prescott Also in Contract Limbo With Cowboys Dallas is dilly-dallying again, as extension talks have fizzled\n\nA few years ago, the Cowboys' front office played coy with Prescott, letting his rookie contract expire before eventually agreeing on a four-year, $160 million deal. With that contract set to expire after 2024, it seems as if history will repeat itself. There are strong arguments for and against extending Prescott.\n\nDespite the media's portrayal sometimes, Prescott has won a lot of games as the Cowboys quarterback. In every season where he started at least 10 games, Dallas went .500 or better in those games. He's 73-41-0 in the regular season as the team's starting quarterback. Prescott quietly racks up passing yards and TDs, too.\n\nDak Prescott: Last Five Seasons\n\nYear\n\nGames Played\n\nRecord\n\nPassing Yards\n\nPassing TDs\n\n2019\n\n16\n\n8-8-0\n\n4,902\n\n30\n\n2020\n\n5\n\n2-3-0\n\n1,856\n\n9\n\n2021\n\n16\n\n11-5-0\n\n4,449\n\n37\n\n2022\n\n12\n\n8-4-0\n\n2,860\n\n23\n\n2023\n\n17\n\n12-5-0\n\n4,516\n\n36\n\nOn the other hand, Dallas still has not made it past the divisional round since winning Super Bowl XXX. Prescott was two years old at the time. It isn't entirely his fault, but the bottom line for this franchise is supposed to be rings.\n\nAnother snag in any Prescott extension talks is that his top weapon, CeeDee Lamb, is due to make major money soon. The organization has to decide who is more important.\n\nSo, Prescott has more pressure on him entering the 2024 campaign. He could earn a huge payday by playing well or have to settle for less in the offseason. An injury before training camp would not help Prescott secure the bag. Hopefully, it's merely a rumor.\n\nSources: The Ross Tucker Podcast, Athlon Sports\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.

Cowboys' Micah Parsons responds to critics amid contract extension talks: \"I love being doubted\"\n\nDak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys have been playing chicken for months. The quarterback has not yet signed his renewal, and the team has not pulled out the wallet to meet his expectations. However, some analysts think that, in the end, Prescott will have to accept that his only chance to win a Super Bowl is in Dallas.\n\n2024 is the final year of Prescott's contract with the Cowboys. As soon as the team's participation in the upcoming season ends, the signal-caller will become an unrestricted free agent. So far, both sides have said they want the quarterback to stay with the team, but they have not made great progress in the negotiation.\n\nPrescott signed his most recent contract in March 2021, worth $160 million, with $120 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $66 million. The player's base salary will be $31 million plus incentives that will take him close to $40 million in 2024.\n\nBeyond that, the analyst indicated that the Mississippi State product will begin to think, \"I got to win playoff games. This team is the best team that I can play on right now to win playoff games. And if I win playoff games and, lo and behold, get to the Super Bowl and win, I'll be the highest-paid player in the league. It won't even be close.\"\n\nTeam owner Jerry Jones has said on multiple occasions that he wants Prescott to stay with the team. In this regard, Edwards assured that the owner of the Cowboys will keep the door open not only for Prescott but for all of his stars, in search of winning their first Super Bowl in 30 years.\n\nFor his part, in the former coach's opinion, Prescott will take the opportunity. \"If you're Dak Prescott,\" Edwards explained, \"I'm saying, 'You know what, Jerry, I'm good. OK, I'm gonna go ahead and play and I'm going to prove to you that I can get us to the Super Bowl and win a Super Bowl.'\"\n\nWhile Edwards and other analysts try to guess the future, the window is closing for Prescott and the Cowboys. In 2021, when he signed his most recent contract, the quarterback waited until the last minute to pressure the team.

Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe worst drama regarding the Dak Prescott contract situation is the need for even more drama between the two camps. There are no new updates about the negotiations between the three-time Pro Bowler and the Dallas Cowboys. Earning a Second-Team All-Pro selection last season should make it a no-brainer for Cowboys owner and de facto general manager Jerry Jones to offer him a lucrative contract.\n\nTherefore, without an extension, the Cowboys can either offer him the franchise tag or see him walk away without getting any assets in return. With the Dallas front office seemingly not showing urgency in locking up their quarterback for the long term, ESPN Radio's Chris Carlin shared on 'First Take' that Prescott should pressure the Cowboys to get this done by holding out in training camp:\n\n\"He shouldn't step on the football field until he has one. He absolutely should hold out. Jerry Jones has, for years, hesitated at every turn to pay Dak Prescott.\"\n\nCarlin recalled that it wasn't the first time Prescott had experienced a delay in getting a contract extension. After playing out his four-year, $2.72-million rookie-scale contract, the Cowboys offered him the franchise tag for two consecutive seasons before agreeing to a four-year, $160 million contract extension.\n\nThe $40 million annual average is a massive bargain, considering the contracts that some quarterbacks received over the last two offseasons. While postseason success has constantly evaded Dak Prescott, he deservingly played to his deal by bringing the Cowboys to 12-win seasons and playoff berths from 2021 to 2023.\n\nTo end his piece, Carlin argues that if Trevor Lawrence and Justin Herbert, two talented quarterbacks who haven't achieved much, are among the highest-paid players in the position, Prescott must be among their ranks in terms of average per year.\n\nWhile Carlin advised the former Mississippi State standout to step away from the Cowboys until his extension gets sorted out, Herm Edwards pondered otherwise.\n\nThe former NFL head coach stated that Prescott must gamble on himself and prove he can lead this team to Super Bowl LIX. Doing that for the Cowboys gives him tremendous leverage when the two sides meet at the negotiating table.\n\n\"I'm going to disagree in this sense if you're Dak Prescott. I'm going to bet on myself, actually, and I'm going to go ahead and play because he's in a great situation with the team that he's on.\"\n\nDak Prescott has All-Pro talent around him in Dallas. He has 2023 First-Team All-Pro members CeeDee Lamb and Zack Martin, who are also eligible for contract extensions. Guard Tyler Smith earned a Second-Team All-Pro nod, much like Micah Parsons.\n\nUnfortunately, there's logic behind the Cowboys' delay in handing out a contract extension to Prescott. He won only two of seven postseason games, and the Cowboys haven't reached the NFC Championship Game since 1995, the season they won their most recent Super Bowl. I\n\nIn comparison, Jared Goff earned a four-year, $212 million extension after leading the Detroit Lions to their first NFC title game since 1991.\n\nRegardless of what happens regarding Dak Prescott's contract in the coming days, he will still earn a $29 million base salary in 2024. However, he will account for $55.4 million or 21.6 percent of the Cowboys' salary cap.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [],

The NFL trade deadline is always and fun time, and it could be more of the same fun in 2024. Right now, I think the NFL is in a great spot with parity - there are so many talented teams and so many teams that can make the playoffs.\n\nThere may only be seven truly elite teams that can win the Super Bowl, but the amount of competition in this league in the present day is outstanding. This could lead to a more active trade deadline period, so let's look at three major trade deadline moves that could happen in 2024.\n\nDak Prescott on the move? I mean, with each passing day that the quarterback does not have a new contract from the Dallas Cowboys, you have to wonder if a trade at some point is likely. The catch here is that both Prescott and Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy are in the last year of their deals, and I am sure that Jerry Jones cannot tolerate a 12-5 season with minimal playoff success much longer.\n\nThe duo just is not working beyond a good regular season, and you have to wonder if the front office might be angling toward a hard reset at coach and QB following the 2024 NFL Season. Perhaps that reset could get a head-start during the year.

According to Fezzik, it's all concerning enough- within the betting world, anyway- to have affected the official over/under of how many games the Cowboys are projected to win this season.\n\nNow, a professional gambler repeating rumors on a podcast in the heat of the NFL's slow-news season is one thing.\n\nBut photographs can put a different spin on things.\n\n\"Dak Prescott was in Los Cabos this weekend,\" a translation of the post's caption reads. \"In the pool he walked normally but this photo ... shows that he has an injury to his right ankle!\"\n\nPrescott, of course, suffered a gruesome dislocation and compound fracture of that same ankle during a Week 5 game against the Giants in the 2020 season; the injury caused him to miss the next 11 months.\n\nHe then strained his right calf in Week 6 of the 2021 season leading the team to an overtime win versus New England. He did his postgame press conference wearing a boot (like the one pictured this week) and ended up missing one game as a result.\n\nFor the best local news, sports, entertainment and culture coverage, subscribe to the Austin American-Statesman.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walking boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Tucker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ross Tucker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_American-Statesman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin American-Statesman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_dislocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint dislocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/BlTD1D53uPdxFheUctWmSA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/dallas_cowboys_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_693/a1c1a264b8522767c9009f6074931752", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703530", "eventUri": "eng-9703530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

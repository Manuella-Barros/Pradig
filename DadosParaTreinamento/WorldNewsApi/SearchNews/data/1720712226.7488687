Since July 5, 1989, the widely acclaimed sitcom crafted by Larry David and Seinfeld has captivated television audiences globally. This July will mark 35 years since its premiere. \"Seinfeld\" had a nine-season run and continues to generate revenue through syndication profits and streaming deals. \"The chemistry and the outcome was just sensational,\" Richards told Jesse Watters on Thursday while promoting his book \"Entrances and Exits,\" released June 4. \"We all worked very, very hard, but we were all into making comedy. You know, getting into the swing of comedy, and both Jerry and I are deeply committed to that,\" Richards said. \"Our friendship came out of, well, he was a fan from the days I was doing \u2018Fridays.\u2019 He was all for me when I was auditioning for the part. He wanted me for the part. Oh boy, thank you. We have been neighbors ever since.\" Richards has largely stayed out of the spotlight since 2006, when he was filmed yelling racial slurs during a stand-up show.

So Larry was very close to the look of Kenny and asked me if I would wear a ponytail,\" Richards recalled. \"And I thought at first that could be interesting. Perhaps it would fall off during the take. You know, the man Kesler at the time who became Kramer wears a hairpiece. I was thinking of how to make that funny, but then I decided I got enough to think about than a hairpiece, so I ditched it.\" Richards revealed that his physical comedy was influenced by iconic Hollywood actors such as Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. \"It just came out of me, I think, in making my friends laugh. I could ride my bike into a bush and do it in such a way that they would just crack up and we'd all be laughing together.\" \"I always wore padding. I was very scientific about that \u2014 really, truly. So I knew how to take falls and bang into walls and things like that. You know, it came quite natural,\" he said. When asked whether political correctness is killing comedy, Richards said \"comedy is coming out of it in a sense.\" \"People are just being more sensitive about what we're saying about each other, which I think is a good thing, \u2014 the way that comics now begin to play with political correctness,\" he said. \"The ha-ha's archetypal. It's everywhere, it's still going to be with us, and it's alive, it's alive.\" Richards admitted that he only recently started watching \"Seinfeld\" with his son. \"I never watched the shows because I could always see how they could be better, and I had to move fast each week in making each episode,\" he said.

Lebanon, as Syria's neighbor, is in prime position to capture a share of that windfall and revive its own sluggish economy.\n\nBattles still rage in Syria's north and east, and in pockets around the capital, Damascus, but the survival of President Bashar Assad's government now appears beyond doubt.\n\nThat is introducing an element of stability into forecasts not seen since 2011, when the war broke out. The Damascus International Fair, a high-profile annual business event before the war, is to open on Thursday for the first time since war broke out, with participants from 43 countries.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the cost to rebuild Syria at $200 billion.\n\nFor Lebanon, that could be just the stimulus it needs -- the tiny Mediterranean country's growth rate has hovered around 1.5 percent since 2013. And though the capital, Beirut, has grown visibly richer over the years, Tripoli and the impoverished north have lagged behind.\n\n\"Lebanon is in front of an opportunity that it needs to take very seriously,\" said Raya al-Hassan, a former finance minister from northern Lebanon who now directs the Tripoli Special Economic Zone project that's planned to be built adjacent to the port.\n\nAhmad Tamer, the port manager, estimates Syria's reconstruction will create a demand for 30 million tons of cargo capacity annually.\n\nSyria's chief ports, Tartous and Latakia, also on the Mediterranean Sea, have a combined capacity of 10 to 15 million tons, he says. He wants Tripoli port to be ready to step in for a portion of the rest.\n\n\"We could provide up to 5 or 6 or 7 million tons,\" he says.\n\nThe port is nearing the completion of the first phase of an expansion project first drawn up in 2009, then revised with an eye on Syria in 2016. Capital investment has reached around $400 million, according to the port manager.\n\nOn a map, Tamer pointed to a vacant quadrant where 7/8preparations are underway to build silos to hold grain destined for regional markets.\n\nSyria's conflict has decimated its food production, which included an average of 4.1 million tons of wheat annually before the war, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nIn 2017, it managed to produce just 1.8 million tons.\n\nLebanon's businessmen and politicians have always maintained close relations with Syrian counterparts. Syria is among Lebanon's largest trade partners, and arguably its most reliable supplier of cheap labor. Lebanon, in exchange, is the banker to many of Syria's enterprises and its wealthy elites.\n\nThese ties give Lebanon -- and Tripoli in particular -- an edge over competitors vying for the Syrian market.\n\nThe city's location is also attracting foreign investment. Tripoli port signed a 25-year lease with the Emirati port operator Gulftainer in 2013, to manage and invest in the terminal.\n\n\"Our aim was to invest here in anticipation of Syria's reconstruction,\" said Ibrahim Hermes, the CEO of Lebanon's subsidiary of Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon is now a fixture on itineraries of prospective investors. Hermes said he has seen delegations arriving from Europe, Asia and especially China, to scope out trade opportunities.\n\nBefore the war in Syria, goods coming through Lebanon's ports used to transit as far afield as Iraq -- saving ships from having to take the sea journey through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThere is talk now that Tripoli could even be a terminal in China's trillion-dollar new \"Silk Road\" project, carving a trade route from east Asia to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese firm Qingdao Haixi Heavy-Duty Machinery Co. sold the two 28-story container cranes now at the port. Safety signs inside the structures are posted in English and Mandarin.\n\n\"Tripoli can be a main transshipment hub for the eastern Mediterranean,\" said Ira Hare, a sunburned British manager working for Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon has officially sought \"dissociation\" from the Syrian war so as not to fuel rancor among political parties split between those aligned with Damascus and those against it.\n\nBut there is also an air of inevitability about the re-normalization of relations, as Assad looks, for the short-term at least, to stay on in power.\n\nSyria's chief champion in Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces, evinces little doubt.\n\n\"Our national interest is for the border between Lebanon and Syria to be open ... because, tomorrow the routes will open to Iraq and to Jordan and we want to be able to transport Lebanese goods,\" Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech this week.\n\nA Hezbollah minister, Hussein Hajj Hussein, is one of two Cabinet ministers headed to Syria this week in a highly controversial visit, the first since the start of the war. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, an Assad critic, said the visit did not have government backing.\n\nDamascus also knows it will be brought back in from the cold.\n\nThe Damascus International Fair, which promises to attract investors from Russia, China, Iran, and other places, is a telling indicator of the mood in the Syrian capital.\n\nEurope and the United States are hesitant to finance the reconstruction projects so long as Assad, a pariah to the West, remains in power. But Russia, China, and Iran, as well as investors in Lebanon and the Middle East, are showing no signs of hesitation.\n\n\"As soon as there is a political agreement to end the war, we will be among the first countries to play a role in reconstruction,\" said al-Hassan, the former finance minister.", "id": "9641252", "details": {"liCnt": 76}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Lebanon prepares for

Lebanon, as Syria's neighbor, is in prime position to capture a share of that windfall and revive its own sluggish economy.\n\nBattles still rage in Syria's north and east, and in pockets around the capital, Damascus, but the survival of President Bashar Assad's government now appears beyond doubt.\n\nThat is introducing an element of stability into forecasts not seen since 2011, when the war broke out. The Damascus International Fair, a high-profile annual business event before the war, is to open on Thursday for the first time since war broke out, with participants from 43 countries.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the cost to rebuild Syria at $200 billion.\n\nFor Lebanon, that could be just the stimulus it needs -- the tiny Mediterranean country's growth rate has hovered around 1.5 percent since 2013. And though the capital, Beirut, has grown visibly richer over the years, Tripoli and the impoverished north have lagged behind.\n\n\"Lebanon is in front of an opportunity that it needs to take very seriously,\" said Raya al-Hassan, a former finance minister from northern Lebanon who now directs the Tripoli Special Economic Zone project that's planned to be built adjacent to the port.\n\nAhmad Tamer, the port manager, estimates Syria's reconstruction will create a demand for 30 million tons of cargo capacity annually.\n\nSyria's chief ports, Tartous and Latakia, also on the Mediterranean Sea, have a combined capacity of 10 to 15 million tons, he says. He wants Tripoli port to be ready to step in for a portion of the rest.\n\n\"We could provide up to 5 or 6 or 7 million tons,\" he says.\n\nThe port is nearing the completion of the first phase of an expansion project first drawn up in 2009, then revised with an eye on Syria in 2016. Capital investment has reached around $400 million, according to the port manager.\n\nOn a map, Tamer pointed to a vacant quadrant where 7/8preparations are underway to build silos to hold grain destined for regional markets.\n\nSyria's conflict has decimated its food production, which included an average of 4.1 million tons of wheat annually before the war, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nIn 2017, it managed to produce just 1.8 million tons.\n\nLebanon's businessmen and politicians have always maintained close relations with Syrian counterparts. Syria is among Lebanon's largest trade partners, and arguably its most reliable supplier of cheap labor. Lebanon, in exchange, is the banker to many of Syria's enterprises and its wealthy elites.\n\nThese ties give Lebanon -- and Tripoli in particular -- an edge over competitors vying for the Syrian market.\n\nThe city's location is also attracting foreign investment. Tripoli port signed a 25-year lease with the Emirati port operator Gulftainer in 2013, to manage and invest in the terminal.\n\n\"Our aim was to invest here in anticipation of Syria's reconstruction,\" said Ibrahim Hermes, the CEO of Lebanon's subsidiary of Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon is now a fixture on itineraries of prospective investors. Hermes said he has seen delegations arriving from Europe, Asia and especially China, to scope out trade opportunities.\n\nBefore the war in Syria, goods coming through Lebanon's ports used to transit as far afield as Iraq -- saving ships from having to take the sea journey through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThere is talk now that Tripoli could even be a terminal in China's trillion-dollar new \"Silk Road\" project, carving a trade route from east Asia to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese firm Qingdao Haixi Heavy-Duty Machinery Co. sold the two 28-story container cranes now at the port. Safety signs inside the structures are posted in English and Mandarin.\n\n\"Tripoli can be a main transshipment hub for the eastern Mediterranean,\" said Ira Hare, a sunburned Briton with 31 years of industry experience who was brought by Gulftainer to manage the terminal.\n\nLebanon has officially sought \"dissociation\" from the Syrian war so as not to fuel rancor among political parties split between those aligned with Damascus and those against it.\n\nBut there is also an air of inevitability about the re-normalization of relations, as Assad looks, for the short-term at least, to stay on in power.\n\nSyria's chief champion in Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces, evinces little doubt.\n\n\"Our national interest is for the border between Lebanon and Syria to be open ... because, tomorrow the routes will open to Iraq and to Jordan and we want to be able to transport Lebanese goods,\" Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech this week.\n\nA Hezbollah minister, Hussein Hajj Hussein, is one of two Cabinet ministers headed to Syria this week in a highly controversial visit, the first since the start of the war. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, an Assad critic, said the visit did not have government backing.\n\nDamascus also knows it will be brought back in from the cold.\n\nThe Damascus International Fair, which promises to attract investors from Russia, China, Iran, and other places, is a telling indicator of the mood in the Syrian capital.\n\nEurope and the United States are hesitant to finance the reconstruction projects so long as Assad, a pariah to the West, remains in power. But Russia, China, and Iran, as well as investors in Lebanon and the Middle East, are showing no signs of hesitation.\n\n\"As soon as there is a political agreement to end the war, we will be among the first countries to play a role in reconstruction,\" said al-Hassan, the former finance minister.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

And though the capital, Beirut, has grown visibly richer over the years, Tripoli and the impoverished north have lagged behind.\n\n\"Lebanon is in front of an opportunity that it needs to take very seriously,\" said Raya al-Hassan, a former finance minister from northern Lebanon who now directs the Tripoli Special Economic Zone project that's planned to be built adjacent to the port.\n\nAhmad Tamer, the port manager, estimates Syria's reconstruction will create a demand for 30 million tons of cargo capacity annually.\n\nSyria's chief ports, Tartous and Latakia, also on the Mediterranean Sea, have a combined capacity of 10 to 15 million tons, he says. He wants Tripoli port to be ready to step in for a portion of the rest.\n\nThe port is nearing the completion of the first phase of an expansion project first drawn up in 2009, then revised with an eye on Syria in 2016.

Syria is among Lebanon's largest trade partners, and arguably its most reliable supplier of cheap labor. Lebanon, in exchange, is the banker to many of Syria's enterprises and its wealthy elites.\n\nThese ties give Lebanon -- and Tripoli in particular -- an edge over competitors vying for the Syrian market.\n\nThe city's location is also attracting foreign investment. Tripoli port signed a 25-year lease with the Emirati port operator Gulftainer in 2013, to manage and invest in the terminal.\n\n\"Our aim was to invest here in anticipation of Syria's reconstruction,\" said Ibrahim Hermes, the CEO of Lebanon's subsidiary of Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon is now a fixture on itineraries of prospective investors. Hermes said he has seen delegations arriving from Europe, Asia and especially China, to scope out trade opportunities.\n\nBefore the war in Syria, goods coming through Lebanon's ports used to transit as far afield as Iraq -- saving ships from having to take the sea journey through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThere is talk now that Tripoli could even be a terminal in China's trillion-dollar new \"Silk Road\" project, carving a trade route from east Asia to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese firm Qingdao Haixi Heavy-Duty Machinery Co. sold the two 28-story container cranes now at the port. Safety signs inside the structures are posted in English and Mandarin.\n\n\"Tripoli can be a main transshipment hub for the eastern Mediterranean,\" said Ira Hare, a sunburned Briton with 31 years of industry experience who was brought by Gulftainer to manage the terminal.\n\nLebanon has officially sought \"dissociation\" from the Syrian war so as not to fuel rancor among political parties split between those aligned with Damascus and those against it.\n\nBut there is also an air of inevitability about the re-normalization of relations, as Assad looks, for the short-term at least, to stay on in power.\n\nSyria's chief champion in Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces, evinces little doubt.\n\n\"Our national interest is for the border between Lebanon and Syria to be open ... because, tomorrow the routes will open to Iraq and to Jordan and we want to be able to transport Lebanese goods,\" Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech this week.\n\nA Hezbollah minister, Hussein Hajj Hussein, is one of two Cabinet ministers headed to Syria this week in a highly controversial visit, the first since the start of the war. Prime Minister Saad Hariri, an Assad critic, said the visit did not have government backing.\n\nDamascus also knows it will be brought back in from the cold.\n\nThe Damascus International Fair, which promises to attract investors from Russia, China, Iran, and other places, is a telling indicator of the mood in the Syrian capital.\n\nEurope and the United States are hesitant to finance the reconstruction projects so long as Assad, a pariah to the West, remains in power. But Russia, China, and Iran, as well as investors in Lebanon and the Middle East, are showing no signs of hesitation.\n\n\"As soon as there is a political agreement to end the war, we will be among

Lebanon, as Syria's neighbour , is in prime position to capture a share of that windfall and revive its own sluggish economy.\n\nBattles still rage in Syria's north and east, and in pockets around the capital, Damascus, but the survival of President Bashar Assad's government now appears beyond doubt.\n\nThat is introducing an element of stability into forecasts not seen since 2011, when the war broke out. The Damascus International Fair, a high-profile annual business event before the war, is to open on Thursday for the first time since war broke out, with participants from 43 countries.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the cost to rebuild Syria at $200 billion.\n\nFor Lebanon, that could be just the stimulus it needs -- the tiny Mediterranean country's growth rate has hovered around 1.5 per cent since 2013. And though the capital, Beirut, has grown visibly richer over the years, Tripoli and the impoverished north have lagged behind.\n\n\"Lebanon is in front of an opportunity that it needs to take very seriously,\" said Raya al-Hassan, a former finance minister from northern Lebanon who now directs the Tripoli Special Economic Zone project that's planned to be built adjacent to the port.\n\nAhmad Tamer, the port manager, estimates Syria's reconstruction will create a demand for 30 million tons of cargo capacity annually.\n\nSyria's chief ports, Tartous and Latakia, also on the Mediterranean Sea, have a combined capacity of 10 to 15 million tons, he says. He wants Tripoli port to be ready to step in for a portion of the rest.\n\n\"We could provide up to 5 or 6 or 7 million tons,\" he says.\n\nThe port is nearing the completion of the first phase of an expansion project first drawn up in 2009, then revised with an eye on Syria in 2016.

Tripoli port signed a 25-year lease with the Emirati port operator Gulftainer in 2013, to manage and invest in the terminal.\n\n\"Our aim was to invest here in anticipation of Syria's reconstruction,\" said Ibrahim Hermes, the CEO of Lebanon's subsidiary of Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon is now a fixture on itineraries of prospective investors. Hermes said he has seen delegations arriving from Europe, Asia and especially China, to scope out trade opportunities.\n\nBefore the war in Syria, goods coming through Lebanon's ports used to transit as far afield as Iraq -- saving ships from having to take the sea journey through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThere is talk now that Tripoli could even be a terminal in China's trillion-dollar new \"Silk Road\" project, carving a trade route from east Asia to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese firm Qingdao Haixi Heavy-Duty Machinery Co. sold the two 28-story container cranes now at the port. Safety signs inside the structures are posted in English and Mandarin.\n\n\"Tripoli can be a main transshipment hub for the eastern Mediterranean,\" said Ira Hare, a sunburned Briton with 31 years of industry experience who was brought by Gulftainer to manage the terminal.\n\nLebanon has officially sought \"dissociation\" from the Syrian war so as not to fuel rancour among political parties split between those aligned with Damascus and those against it.\n\nBut there is also an air of inevitability about the re-normalization of relations, as Assad looks, for the short-term at least, to stay on in power.\n\nSyria's chief champion in Lebanon, the militant Hezbollah group, which is fighting alongside Assad's forces, evinces little doubt.\n\n\"Our national interest is for the border between Lebanon and Syria to be open ... because, tomorrow the routes will open to Iraq and to Jordan and we want to be able to transport Lebanese goods,\" Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech this week.\n\nA Hezbollah minister, Hussein Hajj Hussein, is one of two Cabinet ministers headed to Syria this week in a highly controversial visit, the first since the start of the war.

But Russia, China, and Iran, as well as investors in Lebanon and the Middle East, are showing no signs of hesitation.\n\n\"As soon as there is a political agreement to end the war, we will be among

Lebanon, as Syria's neighbour, is in prime position to capture a share of that windfall and revive its own sluggish economy.\n\nBattles still rage in Syria's north and east, and in pockets around the capital, Damascus, but the survival of President Bashar Al Assad's government now appears beyond doubt.\n\nThat is introducing an element of stability into forecasts not seen since 2011, when the war broke out. The Damascus International Fair, a high-profile annual business event before the war, is to open on Thursday for the first time since war broke out, with participants from 43 countries.\n\nThe World Bank estimates the cost to rebuild Syria at $200 billion.\n\nFor Lebanon, that could be just the stimulus it needs -- the tiny Mediterranean country's growth rate has hovered around 1.5 per cent since 2013. And though the capital, Beirut, has grown visibly richer over the years, Tripoli and the impoverished north have lagged behind.\n\n\"Lebanon is in front of an opportunity that it needs to take very seriously,\" said Raya Al Hassan, a former finance minister from northern Lebanon who now directs the Tripoli Special Economic Zone project that's planned to be built adjacent to the port.\n\nAhmad Tamer, the port manager, estimates Syria's reconstruction will create a demand for 30 million tonnes of cargo capacity annually.\n\nSyria's chief ports, Tartous and Latakia, also on the Mediterranean Sea, have a combined capacity of 10 to 15 million tonnes, he says. He wants Tripoli port to be ready to step in for a portion of the rest.\n\n\"We could provide up to 5 or 6 or 7 million tonnes,\" he says.\n\nThe port is nearing the completion of the first phase of an expansion project first drawn up in 2009, then revised with an eye on Syria in 2016. Capital investment has reached around $400 million (Dh1,468 million), according to the port manager.\n\nOn a map, Tamer pointed to a vacant quadrant where 7/8 preparations are underway to build silos to hold grain destined for regional markets.\n\nSyria's conflict has decimated its food production, which included an average of 4.1 million tonnes of wheat annually before the war, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation.\n\nIn 2017, it managed to produce just 1.8 million tonnes.\n\nLebanon's businessmen and politicians have always maintained close relations with Syrian counterparts. Syria is among Lebanon's largest trade partners, and arguably its most reliable supplier of cheap labour. Lebanon, in exchange, is the banker to many of Syria's enterprises and its wealthy elites.\n\nThese ties give Lebanon -- and Tripoli in particular -- an edge over competitors vying for the Syrian market.\n\nThe city's location is also attracting foreign investment. Tripoli port signed a 25-year lease with the Emirati port operator Gulftainer in 2013, to manage and invest in the terminal.\n\n\"Our aim was to invest here in anticipation of Syria's reconstruction,\" said Ibrahim Hermes, the CEO of Lebanon's subsidiary of Gulftainer.\n\nLebanon is now a fixture on itineraries of prospective investors. Hermes said he has seen delegations arriving from Europe, Asia and especially China, to scope out trade opportunities.\n\nBefore the war in Syria, goods coming through Lebanon's ports used to transit as far afield as Iraq -- saving ships from having to take the sea journey through the Suez Canal and around the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThere is talk now that Tripoli could even be a terminal in China's trillion-dollar new \"Silk Road\" project, carving a trade route from east Asia to Europe.\n\nThe Chinese firm Qingdao Haixi Heavy-Duty Machinery Co. sold the two 28-storey container cranes now at the port. Safety signs inside the structures are posted in English and Mandarin.\n\n\"Tripoli can be a main transshipment hub for the eastern Mediterranean,\" said Ira Hare, a sunburned British manager working for Gulftainer.", "id": "9684777", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Lebanon prepares for Syria's post-war construction windfall", "image": "http://static.gulfnews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2075736!/image/4242615794.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_460346/4242615794.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "127", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tartouss"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "4883", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartus", "label": {"eng": "Tartouss"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "4951", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus", "label": {"eng": "Damascus"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Latakia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "4993", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latakia", "label": {"eng": "Latakia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "8206", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Libya"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Tripoli"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "73098", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli", "label": {"eng": "Tripoli"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations"}, "id": "303396", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"label": {"eng": "Food and Agriculture Organization"}, "id": "303406", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization"}, {"label": {"eng": "Syrian people"}, "id": "303508", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_people"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "303540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bashar al-Assad"}, "id": "304326", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Syrian civil war"}, "id": "305246", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war"}, {"location": null, "score": 1, "id": "311439", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal", "label": {"eng": "Suez Canal"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Bank"}, "id": "312164", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "313896", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arabian Peninsula"}, "id": "317944", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}], "time": "12:24:00"}

The armored vehicles are part of a total order of 32 Bradleys valued at more than $100 million.\n\nThe M2A2s \"will provide the Lebanese Armed Forces with new capabilities to protect Lebanon, to protect its borders, and to fight terrorists,\" U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard said at a ceremony to mark the transfer. \"Over the next several months, the [Lebanese] Army will undergo intensive training on how to operate and maintain this new, very sophisticated combat system.\"\n\nThe first A2 Bradleys entered U.S. Army service in 1988, but received significant modifications after the Desert Storm in 1991. The subsequent Operation Desert Storm, or ODS, subvariants received an eye-safe laser range finder, GPS-navigation system, an infrared imaging system for the vehicle's driver, a computerized battle management system, and other upgrades.\n\nThough hardly new, the vehicles are significantly more capable than the Cold War-era M113A2 and A3 armored personnel carriers that make up the bulk of the Lebanese Armed Forces' existing armored units. These vehicles are lightly armored and have a single .50 caliber machine gun as their main armament in an open-topped turret. Lebanon has modified some to carry the Soviet-era ZPU-23 23mm anti-aircraft gun, which is deadly against lightly protected ground targets, as well as TOW missiles.\n\nComparatively, the Bradley offers better armor protection against both small arms and light anti-tank weapons and protects the gunner inside a full-enclosed turret. The M2A2's main armament is a 25mm chain gun, supplemented by a co-axial machine gun and two-tube TOW missile launcher.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the infantry fighting vehicles have electro-optical and thermal imaging sensors. This means the vehicles will be able to help monitor Lebanon's tense border with Syria and provide accurate more fire support for friendly troops at night.\n\nThese latter abilities are important as Lebanon has been fighting a low-intensity conflict along its sparely populated boundary with Syria since June 2014, when a force of ISIS and the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front fighters briefly took control of the border town of Arsal. These clashes expanded as the Syrian civil war spilled over more into Lebanese territory.\n\nBut the conflict quickly became multi-sided and complex as ISIS and Al Nusra ended all attempts at cooperation in 2015 and began fighting each other, as well as other terrorist groups and government security forces in both Lebanon and Syria. In January 2017, Al Nusra merged with four other groups to form a new entity called Tahrir al-Sham, officially breaking off its allegiance with Al Qaeda in the process. Various actors in the region dispute whether the organization has really severed ties with the global Al Qeada entity.\n\nAt present, the Lebanese armed forces continue to fight ISIS, Tahrir al-Sham, and other militant groups along the border. In July 2017, Lebanon launched its latest offensive into the Qalamoun Mountains, aimed at ISIS and Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nDepending on how long this campaign lasts and the speed with which Lebanese troops learn to use their new vehicles, it is possible that the Bradleys could see their first combat against ISIS or Al Qaeda-linked militants, though the heavy armored vehicles are not particularly well suited to the mountainous terrain. Regardless, the vehicles will provide the country's armed forces with extra firepower in a mobile, protected package for future conflicts and crises.\n\nThis delivery, which also included M992 armored ammunition carriers to go along with Lebanon's M109 self-propelled 155mm howitzers, is the latest example of a long-standing relationship between the country and the United States that dates back to the Cold War. However, the U.S. military has had an especially active relationship with its Lebanese counterparts since 2007, when it rushed military equipment to the country and deployed a small number of special operators in response to an outbreak of fighting with the Palestinian militant group Fatah al-Islam.\n\nSince then, the Pentagon has facilitated the delivery of a significant amount of military hardware, including small arms, 155mm howitzers, and Cessna AC-208 light attack planes. U.S. Special Operations Command Central has also maintained a small forward headquarters to continue training and advising Lebanese special operations units. More recently, the U.S. Air Force began training Lebanese pilots how to fly their forthcoming A-29 Super Tucano light attackers at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.\n\nLike the Super Tucanos, the Bradleys reflect an increasing willingness on the part of the United States to provide Lebanon more advanced weaponry to help it combat various regional threats. President Donald Trump and his administration have stepped up counter-terrorism efforts across the Middle East and North Africa and this support for the Lebanese military seems likely to continue and possibly expand in the near future.\n\nThe United States has already sent a new contingent of special operators to advise and assist Lebanese troops fighting ISIS, though there are no reports of American artillery arriving in the country to support the border campaign as there has been in both Iraq and Syria. Unfortunately, as we have already seen in Iraq and Syria, the fight against ISIS is messily intertwined with a number of other conflicts and competing agendasin the region. The situation in Lebanon is no different.\n\n\"Lebanon is on the front lines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah,\" Trump told Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri during a joint press conference in the White House's Rose Garden on July 25, 2017. \"Hezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people, and the entire region.\"\n\nGiven that many believe Hezbollah assassinated his father, Rafic, in 2005, Hariri would probably not be inclined to disagree, but there's still one glaring problem with this statement. The organization, which receives support from Iran for its parallel armed forces and which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, is part of Lebanon's democratically-elected government and commands the support of a significant portion of the population.\n\nThe situation has only become more complicated considering the group's fighters are active participants in Syria's civil conflict, fighting on behalf of the country's brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad and working alongside Iran and Iranian-backed militia groups. Despite operating in the same area, Lebanese military officials insist that they are not coordinating their Qalamoun offensive with either the Syrian Arab Army or Hezbollah. It's also worth noting that the \"de-escalation zones\" that Russia, Iran, and Turkey have tried to establish do not cover the border between Syria and Lebanon and it did not appear to be a consideration in a reported US-Russia brokered ceasefire arrangement.\n\nBut not everyone appears entirely convinced that there is no connection between the two parties. Hezbollah's intervention in Syria, as well as the Lebanese government's apparent unwillingness or inability to stop them from doing so, prompted Saudi Arabia to cut off a $3 billion military aid plan in February 2016. The Saudis see both the Syria Regime and Hezbollah as part of the so-called \"Shia Crescent\" and extensions of Iran, their major regional competitor.\n\nAll of this potentially puts American forces in the country in their own complex position, as the Trump administration is determined to try and check Iran's influence, including through proxies like Hizbollah, throughout the region, but also fight ISIS and other terrorists. The United States has already had to deal with a similar situation in Northern Syria, playing peacemakerbetween Turkey and Kurdish groups, both of who are ostensible allies of the U.S. military-led anti-ISIS coalition in the country.\n\n\"The United States military has been proud to help in that fight [against terrorism in Lebanon] and will continue to do so,\" Trump said to Hariri in July. \"America's assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese army is the only defender Lebanon needs. It's a very effective fighting force.\"\n\nRight now, however, American troops and their Lebanese partners and U.S.-supplied equipment, such as the new Bradleys, are in the middle of a tense, multi-sided conflict.", "id": "9450406", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "Lebanon gets from U.S. Bradley fighting vehicles as it continues to battle terrorists", "image": null,

The proximity alone underlines Syrian President Bashar Assad's increasingly confident position following significant military gains on the ground in the past year.\n\nAccording to state-run media, participants from 43 countries are taking part in the fair, which is expected to last for 10 days and promises to attract investors mainly from allies like Russia, China and Iran.\n\nEgypt, South Africa and Belarus are also taking part, and organizers say companies from Britain, France and Germany are participating, apparently in a private capacity.\n\nThe Damascus International Fair used to be a high-profile annual event, attracting major investors before the war erupted.\n\nIt's reopening is a telling indicator of the mood in the Syrian capital. Hundreds of attendees seated on a red carpet below a stage stacked with fluttering flags of participating counties stood in a minute of silence for those who died in the war. Then the event kicked off with a live orchestra playing the Syrian national anthem.\n\nAssisted by Russian and Iranian forces, Assad has retaken key parts of the country from rebels who have been significantly weakened in the last two years.\n\nHis political opponents in the West as well as Gulf countries and Turkey are no longer calling on him to step down, and while battles still rage in the country's north and east, and in pockets around Damascus, Assad's survival - at least in the near term - now appears guaranteed.\n\n\"This comeback is an indication that the war in Syria is coming to an end,\" Samer el-Debs, who heads the Damascus Chamber of Industry, told The Associated Press. \"After all what happened, all the economic sanctions against Syria and systematic attempts to destroy Syria, we see that this fair has been reopened.\"\n\nSyrian official media has celebrated the event as a major victory, citing a full occupancy of all Damascus hotels due to the fair. In a press statement at the opening ceremony, Prime Minister Imad Khamis said the fair is an indication of Syria's recovery and insisted the war waged against Syria could not kill the Syrian people's love for life.\n\nAt the Russian pavillon, Roman Khudyakov, a Russian politician, said he was accompanied by a large delegation of Russian businessmen and industrialists to discuss ways of cooperating with the Syrian government.\n\n\"We have 10 million Russia tourists who visit Turkey every day and we want to direct some of those to Syria,\" he said.\n\nThe Damascus trade fair, which was first launched in 1954, was among the oldest and most celebrated across the Arab world, attracting Arab and international investors.\n\nIt was last held in the summer of 2011, few months after the first protests against the Assad family's decade-old rule erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings that swept the Middle East.\n\nSyria's civil war, now in its seventh year, has killed around 450,000 people and displaced around 11 million.\n\n---\n\nAssociated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.", "id": "9754119", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Syria

This is a significant boost for the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armed forces who are engaged in a complex and largely forgotten front in the fight against ISIS and reflects otherwise expanding American military involvement in the country.\n\nOn Aug. 14, 2017, eight M2A2s rolled off a commercial merchant ship onto a pier at the Port of Beirut in the Lebanese capital. The armored vehicles are part of a total order of 32 Bradleys valued at more than $100 million.\n\nThe M2A2s \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill provide the Lebanese Armed Forces with new capabilities to protect Lebanon, to protect its borders, and to fight terrorists,\u00e2\u0080\u009d U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard said at a ceremony to mark the transfer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOver the next several months, the [Lebanese] Army will undergo intensive training on how to operate and maintain this new, very sophisticated combat system.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe first A2 Bradleys entered U.S. Army service in 1988, but received significant modifications after the Desert Storm in 1991. The subsequent Operation Desert Storm, or ODS, subvariants received an eye-safe laser range finder, GPS-navigation system, an infrared imaging system for the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driver, a computerized battle management system, and other upgrades.\n\nThough hardly new, the vehicles are significantly more capable than the Cold War-era M113A2 and A3 armored personnel carriers that make up the bulk of the Lebanese Armed Forces\u00e2\u0080\u0099 existing armored units. These vehicles are lightly armored and have a single .50 caliber machine gun as their main armament in an open-topped turret. Lebanon has modified some to carry the Soviet-era ZPU-23 23mm anti-aircraft gun, which is deadly against lightly protected ground targets, as well as TOW missiles.\n\nComparatively, the Bradley offers better armor protection against both small arms and light anti-tank weapons and protects the gunner inside a full-enclosed turret. The M2A2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main armament is a 25mm chain gun, supplemented by a co-axial machine gun and two-tube TOW missile launcher.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the infantry fighting vehicles have electro-optical and thermal imaging sensors. This means the vehicles will be able to help monitor Lebanon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tense border with Syria and provide accurate more fire support for friendly troops at night.\n\nThese latter abilities are important as Lebanon has been fighting a low-intensity conflict along its sparely populated boundary with Syria since June 2014, when a force of ISIS and the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra Front fighters briefly took control of the border town of Arsal. These clashes expanded as the Syrian civil war spilled over more into Lebanese territory.\n\nBut the conflict quickly became multi-sided and complex as ISIS and Al Nusra ended all attempts at cooperation in 2015 and began fighting each other, as well as other terrorist groups and government security forces in both Lebanon and Syria. In January 2017, Al Nusra merged with four other groups to form a new entity called Tahrir al-Sham, officially breaking off its allegiance with Al Qaeda in the process. Various actors in the region dispute whether the organization has really severed ties with the global Al Qeada entity.\n\nAt present, the Lebanese armed forces continue to fight ISIS, Tahrir al-Sham, and other militant groups along the border. In July 2017, Lebanon launched its latest offensive into the Qalamoun Mountains, aimed at ISIS and Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nDepending on how long this campaign lasts and the speed with which Lebanese troops learn to use their new vehicles, it is possible that the Bradleys could see their first combat against ISIS or Al Qaeda-linked militants, though the heavy armored vehicles are not particularly well suited to the mountainous terrain. Regardless, the vehicles will provide the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armed forces with extra firepower in a mobile, protected package for future conflicts and crises.\n\nThis delivery, which also included M992 armored ammunition carriers to go along with Lebanon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s M109 self-propelled 155mm howitzers, is the latest example of a long-standing relationship between the country and the United States that dates back to the Cold War. However, the U.S. military has had an especially active relationship with its Lebanese counterparts since 2007, when it rushed military equipment to the country and deployed a small number of special operators in response to an outbreak of fighting with the Palestinian militant group Fatah al-Islam.\n\nSince then, the Pentagon has facilitated the delivery of a significant amount of military hardware, including small arms, 155mm howitzers, and Cessna AC-208 light attack planes. U.S. Special Operations Command Central has also maintained a small forward headquarters to continue training and advising Lebanese special operations units. More recently, the U.S. Air Force began training Lebanese pilots how to fly their forthcoming A-29 Super Tucano light attackers at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia.\n\nLike the Super Tucanos, the Bradleys reflect an increasing willingness on the part of the United States to provide Lebanon more advanced weaponry to help it combat various regional threats. President Donald Trump and his administration have stepped up counter-terrorism efforts across the Middle East and North Africa and this support for the Lebanese military seems likely to continue and possibly expand in the near future.\n\nThe United States has already sent a new contingent of special operators to advise and assist Lebanese troops fighting ISIS, though there are no reports of American artillery arriving in the country to support the border campaign as there has been in both Iraq and Syria. Unfortunately, as we have already seen in Iraq and Syria, the fight against ISIS is messily intertwined with a number of other conflicts and competing agendasin the region. The situation in Lebanon is no different.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLebanon is on the front lines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump told Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri during a joint press conference in the White House's Rose Garden on July 25, 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHezbollah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people, and the entire region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGiven that many believe Hezbollah assassinated his father, Rafic, in 2005, Hariri would probably not be inclined to disagree, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still one glaring problem with this statement. The organization, which receives support from Iran for its parallel armed forces and which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, is part of Lebanon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democratically-elected government and commands the support of a significant portion of the population.\n\nThe situation has only become more complicated considering the group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fighters are active participants in Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s civil conflict, fighting on behalf of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brutal dictator Bashar Al Assad and working alongside Iran and Iranian-backed militia groups. Despite operating in the same area, Lebanese military officials insist that they are not coordinating their Qalamoun offensive with either the Syrian Arab Army or Hezbollah. It's also worth noting that the \"de-escalation zones\" that Russia, Iran, and Turkey have tried to establish do not cover the border between Syria and Lebanon and it did not appear to be a consideration in a reported US-Russia brokered ceasefire arrangement.\n\nBut not everyone appears entirely convinced that there is no connection between the two parties. Hezbollah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention in Syria, as well as the Lebanese government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent unwillingness or inability to stop them from doing so, prompted Saudi Arabia to cut off a $3 billion military aid plan in February 2016. The Saudis see both the Syria Regime and Hezbollah as part of the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cShia Crescent\u00e2\u0080\u009d and extensions of Iran, their major regional competitor.\n\nAll of this potentially puts American forces in the country in their own complex position, as the Trump administration is determined to try and check Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s influence, including through proxies like Hizbollah, throughout the region, but also fight ISIS and other terrorists. The United States has already had to deal with a similar situation in Northern Syria, playing peacemakerbetween Turkey and Kurdish groups, both of who are ostensible allies of the U.S. military-led anti-ISIS coalition in the country.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe United States military has been proud to help in that fight [against terrorism in Lebanon] and will continue to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trump said to Hariri in July. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica's assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese army is the only defender Lebanon needs. It's a very effective fighting force.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRight now, however, American troops and their Lebanese partners and U.S.-supplied equipment, such as the new Bradleys, are in the middle of a tense, multi-sided conflict.\n\nYa Libnan is not responsible for the comments that are\u00c2 posted below.

However, both ministers insisted the visits were in an official capacity.\n\nThe controversial trip has received considerable attention in Syria. The national Syrian media had received them at the Lebanese-Syrian border crossing of Jdaidet Yabous. \"We will participate in the Damascus International Fair as Lebanese companies and producers and we will hold talks with Syrian officials on the common economic issues between the two brotherly countries, and we are convinced that the historic relations between Lebanon and Syria will continue,\" said Hajj Hassan, who represents Hezbollah in the Lebanese government.\n\nHe went on to praise \"the Syrian people, army and leaders with the great victories achieved by the Syrians and their allies in countering terrorism and standing resolute against the American-Israeli project that targeted Syria.\"\n\n\"We will discuss with Syrian officials the means to implement the agreements signed between the two countries in terms of agriculture and industry, and despite all what has been said about the visit, we came here with full conviction and faith,\" said Ghazi Zaiter, who represents the Amal movement in the Lebanese government.\n\nHe met with the Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis, who told him that \"Syria is ready to supply Lebanon with an additional 500 megawatts of electricity at prices lower than those paid for the Turkish power ships\" (that Lebanon had rented from Turkey).\n\nThe Lebanese minister also discussed with his Syrian counterpart Ahmad Al-Qadri \"the mechanisms to promote and develop agricultural relations between the two countries,\" the Syrian News Agency reported. Al-Qadri said that a joint technical committee from the two ministries will meet next week in Lebanon, stressing the need to combat all forms of agricultural smuggling between the two countries.\n\nZaiter insisted he went to Damascus as minister of agriculture, at the official invitation of the Syrian minister of economy.\n\n\"Some are trying to label it as a visit in a personal capacity, and we respect these political positions but they will be corrected soon and we will resuscitate the cooperation according to the common history of the two brotherly countries,\" he said.\n\nAfter his meeting with his Syrian counterpart, Mohammed Samer Al-Khalil, Hussein Hajj Hassan said: \"The political and security developments in Syria led to victories and political, security, military and economic breakthroughs and this will have many impacts on Lebanon, the most important of which is the increase in security, military, political and economic stability in Lebanon.\"\n\nHe stressed that it was also reflected on several other levels, including displaced Syrians in Lebanon. \"The recovery of the Syrian economy leads to the recovery of the Lebanese economy thanks to the principles we believe in,\" Hajj Hassan added.\n\nLebanese Public Works and Transportation Minister Youssef Fenianos joined the two ministers in Damascus Thursday afternoon, after the meeting of the Lebanese Cabinet that was held at the Presidential Palace. He said that the visits of the Al-Marada movement to Syria have always been sustained during the past six years.\n\n\"We have neither hidden this fact nor avoided visiting Syria as Marada ministers or officials,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Fenianos added: \"Hezbollah has always maintained good relations with Syria and talks between Speaker Nabih Berri and the Syrian Arab Republic were always sustained at the highest levels.\n\n\"We came to Syria without the consent of Prime Minister Saad Hariri. He has an opinion and we have a different one. Everyone has his own convictions.\"\n\nFenianos went on to say \"there is a political team that wants to brag about its refusal, aiming to mobilize its followers, due to the lack of material that would help in the coming parliamentary elections.\"\n\nIn this context, the president of the General Labor Union in Lebanon, Bechara El-Asmar, announced his participation in the work of the International Trade Union Forum on \"Solidarity with Syrian People and Workers against Terrorism, Blockade, and Imperial Intervention Policies\".

The group's victory in Arsal -- represented by a ceasefire wherein HTS agreed to evacuate Lebanon -- further entwines it with Lebanon's political and military institutions.\n\nOn July 26, Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah made a televised speech to commend recent successes by his troops against the former al-Qaeda affiliate around Arsal and on the border with Syria. Nasrallah's speech was aimed not only at his followers but the broader public, as he stated, this victory was for \"all Lebanese and peoples in the region [Christians and Muslims] who have suffered from takfiri terrorism.\"\n\nThroughout the recent battle, Hezbollah has amplified its nationalistic messaging, apparent in Nasrallah's most recent speech but also displayed in battlefield reporting and even political cartoons. Multiple images and videos have been shared on affiliated social media accounts of Hezbollah fighters removing militant flags and replacing them with the Lebanese flag on top and Hezbollah's own at the bottom. This image has been replicated on documents related to the operation and appeared over Nasrallah's right shoulder during his July 26 speech. Another showed Hezbollah fighters holding banners with pictures and names of LAF soldiers killed in the operation, further promoting unity and shared sympathy between the Shia organization and state forces.\n\nIn one series of cartoons, Hezbollah-affiliated media launched a social media campaign seemingly aimed at emphasizing Hezbollah's role in protecting the Lebanese state and people. One shows the cedar tree on the Lebanese flag saluting Hezbollah troops, captioned, \"a resistance that protects the homeland,\" while another shows the Lebanese flag stating to the Hezbollah banner, \"I swear, I become greater by you.\" These campaigns -- as well as the \"army, people, resistance\" motto Hezbollah is making a renewed effort to promote and the overall pro-Hezbollah media coverage of the Arsal events -- indicate the organization's clear objective of seeking further popularity within Lebanon and consolidating its association with the state's security institutions. Hezbollah's popularity has noticeably worsened since the organization joined the war in Syria -- even among its Shia support base, given the fierce fighting and estimated 1,048 casualties.\n\nNasrallah's nationalistic tone was not new, but its context is markedly different than that over the past five years. Hezbollah is ascendant. When the organization publicly entered into the war in neighboring Syria, it was not ready for the task at hand. The group suffered significant losses, with bombs hitting at the heart of Hezbollah's strongholds. Its fighters bore many casualties and, because they had previously been focused on Israel, lacked the training and strategy to fight an adversary that fights much like the group itself. The narrative that Hezbollah was fighting to protect all Lebanese from takfiris and stop the Syrian war from entering Lebanon was not bought outside of the group's immediate support base. That was before the rise of the Islamic State (IS) or HTS in Idlib. It was also before Hezbollah adapted to its fight in Syria, gained a powerful international ally in Russia, and showed that it could be a meaningful partner alongside state actors.\n\nThough Syrian rebels and jihadi groups have been operating in the outskirts of Arsal on the Lebanon-Syria border since 2013, IS and HTS ended up firmly entrenched in the mountainous region after intense rounds of fighting in 2014. The latest round of open military conflict against Syrian rebel groups held up in the Qalamoun region has so far been both a physical and propaganda victory for Hezbollah. The likely defeat of the IS contingent on the Lebanese-Syrian border will not only mark the end of a rebel military presence on Lebanese soil. It will further bolster Hezbollah's rhetoric that its involvement in the Syrian civil war in support of the Assad regime was necessary -- not only to protect Lebanon's sovereignty and limit blowback from the Syrian war. The fight was also to ensure the flow of Iran-supplied arms to Hezbollah.\n\nThe involvement of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), and their future campaign against IS, are logical, as they are the government's legal instrument of violence. But the LAF's involvement was instead the result of Hezbollah's pressure to take the battle to HTS and IS, with Nasrallah publicly committing his soldiers to Arsal on July 11. Despite the $80 million in foreign aid the LAF receives, their military capability cannot match that of Hezbollah (which itself receives about $100-$200 million from Iran per year just for political and social services, as well as military aid). The jihadi presence in Arsal has long been an issue, and the LAF, while playing an important defensive role, was unable to take any meaningful effort to oust them. While Hezbollah and its Lebanese allies exercise pressure on the LAF to lead the battle, the army had no choice but to conduct the operation, even knowing that it would upset international funders, particularly the United States and Saudi Arabia, for coordinating with Hezbollah and that Hezbollah would be ultimately credited for the operation's success. Otherwise, the LAF -- and by extension the Lebanese state -- would look weak, leading to increased public doubt about its ability to protect Lebanon. It is especially important at a time when the country's president, Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, has stated that the Shia militia is essential for Lebanon's defense. And since cooperation between the LAF and Hezbollah increased by 2013 and 2014 on issues related to border security, the army seems to use the militia also as a valuable intelligence source that enables it to prevent bombing further inside Lebanon. Thus, the LAF is to a large extent held hostage by Hezbollah.\n\nHezbollah desires increased popularity at home, particularly given upcoming legislative elections, possibly held in May 2018, which will be held under the new electoral law giving the pro-Hezbollah camp a better chance in districts traditionally controlled by its rivals. By linking its operations against militants in the border area to the national good, Lebanese sovereignty, and an identity that spans confessional lines, it is attempting to gain further popularity. This has the added effect of demonstrating resolve to its support base not only among the Shia, but Christian allies as well. In this context, the August 3 parade through al-Qaa of the Hezbollah fighters freed as the result of negotiations with HTS was meant to reassure Christian allies of Hezbollah's determination to protect the community against an enemy that, if successful, would have subjugated them or worse. Hezbollah's multi-faith messaging and fight against other designated terrorist organizations, including the anti-IS campaign in Iraq, has also softened its image internationally -- to the point that U.S. Special Forces, which the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed on August 3 were present in Lebanon to provide training and support, may embed with the LAF and engage with IS from Lebanese territory in a separate but coordinated effort with the Syrian Army and Hezbollah.\n\nIn promoting itself as fighting for the Lebanese good, Hezbollah seeks public support from within Lebanon, particularly among non-Shias. This undermines the Lebanese state and further justifies Hezbollah's continued existence as an armed non-state actor. The promotion of nationalistic rhetoric and symbols, which resonate among and hold the possibility to attract Lebanese from across the political spectrum, brings about trust in Hezbollah's actions. Not that Hezbollah believes it will gain immense popularity outside of its support base, but rather that it can spread a general feeling among Lebanese that its continued armed role is necessary. With several years of experience in Syria, Hezbollah is portraying itself as the protector of Lebanon from jihadi threats and in any future conflict with Israel. The Iran-funded organization is adopting a larger role in the region -- seen in its engagement in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen -- that requires further consolidation of power within Lebanon.\n\nThe Arsal operation also marks an unprecedented, indirect coordination between the Lebanese state and the Syrian regime via Hezbollah as an intermediary. It may prove to be the foundation of normalized relations between the Lebanese state and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. Nowhere is this possibility more apparent than in the repatriation of over 10,000 Syrian refugees since the Arsal operation, built on the anti-refugee sentiment shared by Hezbollah and the Lebanese state. Both President Aoun and Hezbollah's Nasrallah have called repeatedly on the Saad Hariri government to reinitiate relations with the Assad regime in order to facilitate the return of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The Syrian air force also reportedly raided targets in the Bekaa Valley in support of the Arsal battle. It remains to be seen, however, whether the LAF might begin direct coordination with the Assad regime to continue the Arsal operations against IS and whether the Hariri government would normalize relations with Assad.\n\nAt this point, it is unclear how flexible the Lebanese state can be in its future cooperation with Hezbollah -- especially as long as the group asserts itself as the people's force. Growing relations between the LAF and Hezbollah -- not just on Arsal, but also increased intelligence sharing on Syria and coordination on other domestic security issues like countering the radical Salafi movement led by Ahmad al-Assir in Sidon in 2013 -- will undoubtedly worsen sectarian fears among Sunni communities. Sunnis in Lebanon, particularly in Tripoli, are reportedly losing faith in the neutrality of the army. The army could likely fall deeper into the confessional trap as it is perceived to move closer to the Shia organization. Furthermore, increasing LAF-Hezbollah ties could raise concerns among the United States (Lebanon is the sixth-largest recipient of U.S. military aid) and other international and regional countries that the state is serving the interests of Iran in the region.", "id": "9737149", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Hezbollah Re-Ascendant in Lebanon", "image": "http://carnegieendowment.org/images/article_images/1708corbeil.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 563, "amb": false, "textEnd": 570, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-07-26"}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 4843, "date": "2017-07-11", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4850}, {"imp": true, "textStart": 6869, "amb": false, "textEnd": 6877, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-03"}, {"textStart": 6367, "date": "2018-05-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 6375}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "102", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "106", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Iraq"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "127", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "193", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}, "id": "303510", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bashar al-Assad"}, "id": "304326", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad"}, {"label": {"eng": "Syrian civil war"}, "id": "305246", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}, "id": "309442", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}, "id": "316313", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "336872", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsal", "label": {"eng": "Arsal"}, "type": "loc"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 286, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Time Period", "uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Time_Period"}], "time": "16:50:00"}

(Reuters) The visit of Lebanese visitors to Syria did not escalate into a major political dispute in line with the politicians' agreement to avoid bringing up contentious files at cabinet. Prime Minister Saad Hariri is still committed to avoiding such issues at government, saying that each person is responsible for his actions.\n\nThe debate over the visits of ministers to Syria was limited to whether these trips should be labeled as personal or official, said Transportation and Public Works Minister Youssef Finianous, who along with Industry Minister Hussein al-Hajj Hassan and Agriculture Minister Ghazi Zoaiter had arrived in Damascus on Wednesday.\n\nThe officials traveled to neighboring Syria to take part in the Damascus International Fair, which kicked off on Thursday.\n\nIt appears that the repercussions of the visits will not reach cabinet or put it before a new test given that the Hajj Hassan and Zoaiter will not be signing any new agreements while in Syria, widely informed sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.\n\nThey will only reactivate old deals, as indicated in their agenda and meetings in Damascus, they added.\n\nThe Lebanese constitution stipulates that a minister's foreign visit is only considered official if he has the approval of cabinet that grants him political backing. In this case, the government did not approve the visits and therefore any agreement signed by the minister will not be recognized.\n\nHajj Hassan had held talks on Thursday with Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis, who said: \"We will be able to overcome major economic challenges through positive discussion, cooperation and dialogue.\"\n\nFor his part Hajj Hassan, who represents \"Hezbollah\" in cabinet, stated that the Lebanese participation in the Damascus fair \"reaffirms the natural Lebanese stance that supports Syria.\"\n\n\"Our presence here in Syria, with representatives of the private sector, is aimed at holding discussions with ministers and Syrian officials to tackle economic issues between our countries and in order to provide fair trade,\" he stressed.\n\n\"We hope that border crossings will soon be opened between Syria and each of Iraq and Jordan ahead of bolstering our exports to Syria and later to other Arab countries,\" he added.\n\nThe ministers are accompanied on their visit by a Lebanese delegation comprised of 14 representatives of companies taking part in the Damascus International Fair.

Prime Minister Saad Hariri is still committed to avoiding such issues at government, saying that each person is responsible for his actions.\n\nThe debate over the visits of ministers to Syria was limited to whether these trips should be labeled as personal or official, said Transportation and Public Works Minister Youssef Finianous, who along with Industry Minister Hussein al-Hajj Hassan and Agriculture Minister Ghazi Zoaiter had arrived in Damascus on Wednesday.\n\nThe officials traveled to neighboring Syria to take part in the Damascus International Fair, which kicked off on Thursday.\n\nIt appears that the repercussions of the visits will not reach cabinet or put it before a new test given that the Hajj Hassan and Zoaiter will not be signing any new agreements while in Syria, widely informed sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.\n\nThey will only reactivate old deals, as indicated in their agenda and meetings in Damascus, they added.\n\nThe Lebanese constitution stipulates that a minister's foreign visit is only considered official if he has the approval of cabinet that grants him political backing. In this case, the government did not approve the visits and therefore any agreement signed by the minister will not be recognized.\n\nHajj Hassan had held talks on Thursday with Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis, who said: \"We will be able to overcome major economic challenges through positive discussion, cooperation and dialogue.\"\n\nFor his part Hajj Hassan, who represents \"Hezbollah\" in cabinet, stated that the Lebanese participation in the Damascus fair \"reaffirms the natural Lebanese stance that supports Syria.\"\n\n\"Our presence here in Syria, with representatives of the private sector, is aimed at holding discussions with ministers and Syrian officials to tackle economic issues between our countries and in order to provide fair trade,\" he stressed.\n\n\"We hope that border crossings will soon be opened between Syria and each of Iraq and Jordan ahead of bolstering our exports to Syria and later to other Arab countries,\" he added.\n\nThe ministers are accompanied on their visit by a Lebanese delegation comprised of 14 representatives of companies taking part in the Damascus International Fair. Sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that some of the companies are presenting their products at the fair, while others are in Syria to study the possibility of taking part in the country's reconstruction process.\n\nFinanous, of the Marada Movement of MP Suleiman Franjieh, said on Thursday that he was in Damascus at the invitation of the Syrian minister of economy.\n\nHe said that he did not create uproar over his trip, \"because it is very natural for me as a minister and for the Marada Movement.\"\n\nHe added that he had informed Hariri of his decision to head to Damascus, saying that the premier \"has his stance and I have my own.

Reportedly, Israel is finalizing elaborate plans to once and for all eviscerate Hezbollah while accelerating the collapse of the Iranian theocracy with the claimed support of the White House and the Saudi block among many others.\n\nAccording to a recent Lebanese public opinion poll Israel's long expected invasion of Lebanon is also supported by approximately 80% of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims, roughly 60-65 % of Lebanon's Christians and a lesser percentage of Druze and other sects. This, despite the certain massive infrastructure damage and loss of civilian lives that the next war with Hezbollah will entail. The certain widespread death and destruction apparently being an acceptable price to rid Lebanon of what they claim is Iran's colonization and Hezbollah's forced supplication of their country.\n\nIn point of fact, when Israel next invades Lebanon it will constitute its 6th war on Lebanon, the earlier ones it chooses to ignore being the 1978 South Lebanon invasion up to the Litani River, the June 1982 invasion and 18 year occupation of South Lebanon, the July 1993 \"Operation Accountability\" , a devastating week-long relentless attack on Lebanon, the 1996 Operation Grapes of Wrath invasion of Lebanon and the 34 day July War of 2006. The latter killed more than 1300 Lebanese and wounded thousands while displacing more than one million Lebanese to Syria and elsewhere. Also killed in the July 2006 5th Israel-Lebanon war were 121 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians.\n\nMindful that the next Israel-Hezbollah war could break out at any moment due to miscalculation, failure in communication, or uncontrolled escalation, circumspection is warranted in weighing Hezbollah and Israel's military and political prospects briefly noted below.\n\nTwo of Israel's many challenges during its 6th war on Lebanon will be Hezbollah's massive military build-up with thousands of precision weapons and the growing Iranian domination in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Gulf. Both being constructed by Tehran to reach a strategic balance with Israel and gain the capability to massively damage Israel's critical military assets and civilian infrastructure.\n\nIsrael, with less that 8% of Iran's population and 3% of its size is also uniquely vulnerable to Hezbollah's precision weapons given that it is a very small country with easily targeted infrastructures. For example, Israel's electricity generation which produces roughly 16,000 MW of electricity clusters more than one-third (10 turbines) in only two well-known exposed locations which could be instantly destroyed by a small number of precision missiles. Hezbollah has exhibited to visitors its detailed maps of these facilities and many others which it also possesses for Israel's natural gas infrastructure and its five sea water desalination facilities (which supply more than half of Israel's drinking water) among many other exposed and easily targeted infrastructures as well as military bases and installations.\n\nIsrael must also decide exactly who during its next war its adversaries are. The obvious enemy is Hezbollah but increasingly perhaps also the Lebanese Republic. The reason is that Hezbollah has become the dominate political and military force in Lebanon.\n\nFor its part Israel has drawn red lines, including Hezbollah's acquisition from Iran, and even its own production, of precision weapons inside Lebanon, as well as Iranian deployment to Syria for Hezbollah's use of high impact Iranian weapon systems, including advanced surface-to-air missiles, coast-to-sea/coast missiles, and precision surface-to-surface missiles.\n\nUnlike the July War of 2006, which some argue ended in more of less a draw, Hezbollah could draw on Iranian forces in Syria and according to Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah, in a widely criticized recent speech, scores of thousands of largely Shia People's Mobilization Forces (PMF), also known as the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), from several countries in the region which it continues to help train, arm, command and sometimes fight alongside of. This major military asset, which could theoretically swarm northern and eastern Israel, did not exist in 2006 when Hezbollah and Israel last fought.\n\nAnother problem for Israel during its 6th war on Lebanon are Russia's goals in Syria meaning that unleashed hostilities on Israel's northern border with Lebanon could for any number of reasons spread into Syria. Israel-Hezbollah fighting that spreads into Syria, would likely interfere with Russian projects to establish its own order in Syria which surely would entail Russia having major influence on the warring parties conduct, restraint, and deployment as well as any settlement in Syria. Russia could well seek to thwart Israel's political, strategic, and even operational freedom to act against Hezbollah along the Syria-Lebanon border so as to protect the Assad regime for its own future benefit. This could lead to Israel having to consider the Hezbollah, Syrian, and Lebanese theaters as one.\n\nIt's true that Israeli public opinion suggests widespread support for another but less flawed war with Hezbollah than the 5th one in July of 2006, about which Israel's military establishment has concluded that Israel relied too heavily on its air force wanting to spare ground troops.\n\nFrankly, Tel Aviv officials and Israel lobby fanatics who claim that an Israeli 1967-like victory is possible and would achieve the elimination of Iran's ambitions in the Levant and especially in Lebanon, while gutting Hezbollah while strengthening Israel's regional deterrence appear somewhat delusional. The next war is a battle that will likely not be \"won\" by Israel and its realistic war aims will not match the damage it will suffer.\n\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah's Lebanese supporters are also increasingly having second thoughts about another Hezbollah-Israel war. Thirty years of \"Resistance\" hype has grown stale among a large segment of Lebanon's Shia community who claim it's irrelevant to their lives, where jobs and opportunities for their youth are scarce, and they being exploited by Hezbollah officials to advance Iranian not Lebanese interests.\n\nIn Hezbollah neighborhoods, its involvement in Syria, which began in 2011 on orders from Tehran has cost Lebanese Shia countless hundreds of well-paying jobs in the Gulf with many being expelled, amidst increased calls for all GCC countries to expel all Lebanese Shia.

Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon told the U.S.-based Al-Hurra Arabic TV network that American troops are there to provide assistance for the upcoming offensive against ISIS in the northeast border region in which the LAF will attack from from inside Lebanon while Hezbollah advances from Syria to the east.\n\nPursuing the twin Middle East objectives of destroying ISIS and pushing back against Iran was always a dicey proposition. Even with meticulous military and political planning, ensuring that one doesn't gain strength at the expense of the other was bound to be a task fraught with difficulties. That's what makes the decision to boost Iran and its proxies in order to finish off ISIS in Syria so confounding.\n\nMilitary sources also told the London-based Arabic daily, Asharq al-Awsat, that the American presence is \"to monitor the U.S. military aid delivered to the army,\" a reference to the $1.4 billion in security assistance the U.S. has provided Lebanon since 2005, $80 million of which the LAF received last year in equipment and training.\n\nPutting an exclamation point on the matter, on Monday the U.S. delivered eight M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles (the first of 32 total) and armored field artillery ammunition supply vehicles to the LAF. The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Elizabeth Richard, explained in a statement how the United States \"has intensified its engagement and support to the Lebanese Army over the past few years,\" and went on to provide an impressive list of weapons, munitions, and vehicles delivered in the past 12 months alone. \"America's support for Lebanon,\" she concluded, \"is based on the shared interests of the American people and the Lebanese people.\"\n\nThe problem with the policy expansion in Lebanon is that the LAF today is simply another arm of Hezbollah, the terrorist group that runs Lebanon. Even Sunni politicians like Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who visited President Trump at the White House in July, are forced to play by the Shiite proxy's rules. That means U.S. support for the LAF is helping Iran, which spawned Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1982. That news should be concerning because until 9/11, Hezbollah held the distinction of being the terrorist group responsible for killing the most Americans.\n\nThe genesis of this backward U.S. policy has its roots in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which was passed in the wake of the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. As Levant specialist, Tony Badran of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies explained, the resolution was later reinterpreted by the Obama administration during the negotiations to reach an agreement over Iran's nuclear program. That shift in focus remains the policy of the Trump administration today.\n\nIn the wake of the 2006 war, UNSCR 1701 was designed to disarm Hezbollah and prevent their resupply and illegal smuggling of weapons from Iran and Syria. It also called for the deployment of the LAF throughout Lebanon to assert its sovereignty. Back then, \"the extension of the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory\" referred to its independence from Syria, whose soldiers finally left Lebanon after a 30-year occupation a year earlier.\n\n\"The theory then was that Hezbollah had really taken it on the chin,\" a senior White House official explained to me at the end of June. \"General John Abizaid, the CENTCOM commander, really got this going because he thought now is the time to build up the Lebanese state so that it can be a counter-weight to Hezbollah's power throughout the country and that over time, the LAF would eclipse Hezbollah as the main military power.\"\n\n\"Well, that hasn't happened,\" he admitted with raised eyebrows and a shake of his head, \"but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have done it. It means what we did we probably could have done better.\"\n\nFast forward a few years after several crises and Hezbollah has taken over all the levers of power in the Lebanese state. They didn't disarm; they resupplied and then added more missiles of increasing sophistication and lethality that are capable of carrying larger payloads with vastly improved accuracy over much longer distances. In fact, according to official Israeli estimates, the U.S.-designated terrorist group that is pledged to Israel's destruction has some 150,000 rockets and missiles today -- a 12-fold increase over the 13,000 they held before the 2006 war.\n\nThey even turned some of their weapons against the Lebanese people in May 2008 after a 17-month long political crisis. Meanwhile, Hezbollah members and their recruits continued to penetrate the LAF, which was supposed to be representing Lebanese independence in the face of internal and external threats.\n\nSeveral years later during the nuclear negotiations with Iran, Barack Obama reinterpreted the resolution \"to fit its regional pro-Iran policy,\" Badran explained. \"Trump's predecessor publicly recognized the need to 'respect' what he called Iran's 'equities' in Syria. That was a euphemism for Iran's ability to maintain its bridge to Hezbollah in Lebanon.\"\n\nAs such, in the thick of the nuclear negotiations with Iran in 2014, Obama altered the mandate of UNSCR 1701 and dropped any mention of the parts that demanded Hezbollah disarm or called for the prevention of weapons smuggling. They focused instead on combating \"Syria-origin Sunni extremists,\" which as Badran pointed out, was in turn adopted as the State Department's standard language in its annual Country Reports on Terrorism.\n\nWhen the U.S. put together another arms package for the LAF in 2015 -- that included laser-guided rockets and light attack aircraft -- it was justified on the grounds it supported the implementation of UNSCR 1701. Likewise, when the State Department released its most recent updated Country Reports on Terrorism in mid-July, the identical language the Obama administration used in 2014 appeared.\n\nThe rationale behind the expansion of U.S. assistance to the Lebanese Armed Forces was explained to me weeks before the Lebanese prime minister visited Washington and before it became policy. As the senior White House official put it, \"there's a spectrum\" when it comes to the LAF. \"Different parts of the LAF might be at different places on the spectrum.\" He went on to explain that the U.S. needs to be \"smart with our interaction with them\" to discern where their loyalties lie.\n\n\"If you come to a point where Hezbollah begins to wither on the vine -- for whatever reason,\" he said, elaborating on the goal of the vetting process and cooperation, \"you're still going to want someone to be the last man standing who is not, for example, a militia\" that is removed from the mainstream. \"So people who just call for us to shut off the tap to the LAF, or suggest that if it comes to it and Israel has to take down Hezbollah then they should take down the LAF too -- well, it would seem very much to me to be a case of throwing out the baby with the bath water. That's my personal view.\"\n\nThat conversation took place in the waning days of June and as he said, \"We don't have a policy on this yet. But I would say that the idea that we should just cut the LAF off is shortsighted. For as many flaws as it has -- and I've been pointing them out for years -- it still doesn't mean we should stop. It means we need to be smarter about doing it. That's my personal opinion.\"\n\nTony Badran argued that Prime Minister Hariri's recent visit with President Trump was \"part of a coordinated, multifaceted information campaign to swindle the U.S. government into continuing its military support and extending political cover for the evolving pro-Iran order in Lebanon and Syria. Everyone -- Hariri, Hezbollah, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and its supporters and publicists in Washington -- is in on the con.\" It would appear, then, that they were not only pushing on an open door but they had the White House at \"hello.\"\n\nWhether this rationale formed the basis of what would become U.S. policy, or whether the decision is merely due to existing policy inertia and the clever pro-Hezbollah information campaign, a few things are clear: Israel comes out as the big loser in all of this and Hezbollah, Iran, and the Syrian butcher, Bashar al-Assad are the winners.\n\nThe most the U.S. can expect from this arrangement is a telephone number to call if Hezbollah and the Lebanese state collapse -- which is less likely to happen when the Trump administration contributes to Iran and Hezbollah's regional designs.\n\nPerhaps these problems in policy will come out in the wash when the Trump administration finally decides to adopt an overall strategy to deal with Iran. Maybe then the focus will take into account the whole Middle East chessboard, rather than just a corner where tweaking military tactics on the margins serves as a substitute. Until that day comes, America's recent shift in Lebanon isn't merely a continuation of the existing Obama-era policy but rather its expansion. And that likely won't sit well with those hoping Mr. Trump would bring a course correction to Washington.", "id": "9528243", "details": {"liCnt": 10}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "U.S. Policy in Lebanon Is Now Helping Hezbollah and Iran", "image": "http://cdn.weeklystandard.biz/cache/r960-82c71d82982028b4fc98431746ee9bf1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 4675, "date": "2008-05-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 4683}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "102", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "label": {"eng": "State of Israel"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "127", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}, "id": "302950", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}, "id": "303094", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}, "id": "303326", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sunni Islam"}, "id": "303503", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}, "id": "304051", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}, "id": "308425", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shia Islam"}, "id": "309442", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"}, {"label": {"eng": "Levant"}, "id": "314553", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}, "id": "316313", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lebanese Armed Forces"}, "id": "318788", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Armed_Forces"}, {"label": {"eng": "2006 Lebanon War"}, "id": "337013", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Saad Hariri"}, "id": "395065", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saad_Hariri"}, {"label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701"}, "id": "665717", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_1701"}, {"label": {"eng": "Arabic"}, "id": "1044431", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic"}], "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}], "time": "17:04:00"}

After discussions, the Lebanese minister called the Damascus International Fair \"evidence of Syria's political, economic, military and security recovery,\" according to Lebanon 24. The Syrian and Lebanese armies are both involved in operations to clear ISIS from their mutual border but receive backing from opposing international powers and maintain no formal alliance.\n\nDespite heightened tensions between U.S.-backed forces in Syria and those supported by Russia and Iran in recent months, Washington and Moscow established a ceasefire between the Syrian military and rebels battling in the country's southwest in July. The lull in fighting has allowed both pro-government forces and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a mostly Kurdish coalition of Arabs and ethnic minorities, to concentrate on dismantling the remains of ISIS's self-proclaimed caliphate. U.S. officials, however, have remained deeply critical of Assad even after pledging closer cooperation with Russia, and have called for his eventual removal from power.", "id": "9816953", "details":

participating directly, and 20 others represented by companies, lined the entrance to the exhibition ahead of its inauguration by Prime Minister Imad Khamis later on Thursday, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIran and Russia, the main allies of the Syrian government, as well as China, top the list of participants in the fair.\n\nOrganizers say firms from Britain, France and Germany exhibit their goods and services in the event through agents, though their governments have severed relations with Syria.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in the exhibition, deputy head of Iran Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ICCIMA), Hossein Selahvarzi, said Iran has the highest number of companies in the event, with 30 firms in a pavilion with an area of more than 1,000 square meters.\n\nChina and Egypt fall behind Iran in terms of the number of firms attending the fair, he added, noting that the foreign businesses have shown enthusiasm for presence in the event given the increasing stability and security in the Arab country.\n\nMore than six years of war have taken a severe toll on Syria, costing the economy $226 billion, according to a new World Bank report.", "id":

Those arrests have given US law enforcement a pretty clear idea of the specific items on Hezbollah's wish-list - advanced rifles, night goggles, specialized communications gear and so forth. Hezbollah might also have wished that its agents had succeeded in their clandestine buying missions instead of being busted and going to prison. Yet even in the fever-dreams of Hezbollah's bunker-bound leader, Hassan Nasrallah, it seems unlikely that anyone in the group imagined that the Pentagon would simply ship the advanced American gear they sought to obtain to Lebanon, gratis.\n\nBut on Monday, US Ambassador to Lebanon Elizabeth Richard revealed that the Pentagon has done exactly that - or near enough to make Hassan Nasrallah jump for joy inside his bunker. In remarks delivered at the Port of Beirut, Ambassador Richard reviewed the material contents of a $100 million contribution that the US is making to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), which last month provided support to Hezbollah in a joint military operation in northeastern Lebanon. Hailing the first eight of a promised thirty-two M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles that the US will be delivering to the LAF, Richard reviewed the items the US has delivered to the LAF over the past 12 months. Along with heavier weapons, Richard revealed, the list includes \"4,000 M4 rifles,\" \"320 night vision devices and thermal sights,\" and \"360 secure communication radios.\"\n\nWhy is this noteworthy? Well, as it happens, these precise items have been on Hezbollah's shopping list consistently for almost a decade.\n\nIn 2009, Hezbollah official Hassan Hodroj and his son-in-law Dib Harb were indicted in Pennsylvania where they sought to purchase 1,200 Colt M4 Carbines and to ship them from the US to the port of Latakia in Syria. Harb, the indictment revealed, had told the cooperating witness in the case that a Hezbollah official had called him from Iran \"and emphasized the need for quick delivery\" of the rifles.\n\nThat same year, as part of this effort, procurement agent Dani Tarraf was also arrested and indicted with his associates for trying to procure weapons and other equipment for Hezbollah. Tarraf had approached an undercover law enforcement officer to get shoulder-fired missiles and 10,000 Colt M4 Carbines, which he also intended to ship to the port of Latakia. In addition, Tarraf handed the undercover officer product specifications for third-generation night-vision camera lenses, low-light video cameras, and thermal imaging devices. Tarraf and his associates also wanted the undercover officer to provide them with \"500 military radios\" -- not any radios, but a sophisticated model \"capable of exchanging communications between radio frequencies and fiber-optic networks\" - for shipment to Beirut international airport.\n\nAround the same time, Patrick Daniel Nayyar was arrested in Queens and charged with attempting to provide material support to Hezbollah. Nayyar told the FBI informant he thought was a go-between to the group, that he and his co-conspirator could provide Hezbollah with \"sniper rifles and night vision goggles,\" among other items.\n\nMore recently, in October 2015, Iman Kobeissi was arrested in Atlanta and arraigned at the federal courthouse in Brooklyn on money laundering conspiracy charges and unlicensed firearms dealing conspiracy. Kobeissi had presented an undercover DEA agent with a list of weapons for her associates in Iran and for Hezbollah in Lebanon. The list for her Iran-based customer included an order for 250 M200 sniper rifles and 500 M4 Carbine rifles.\n\nProponents of supporting the LAF in Washington have long defended the policy of arming the Lebanese army -- which Hezbollah now controls politically -- with two ready ripostes. First, they point out how the LAF has a perfect record of not transferring US-origin equipment directly to Hezbollah. They also go one step further and claim that the critics' concerns are baseless, since Hezbollah wouldn't want any of the equipment the US gives the LAF anyway.\n\nAt a congressional hearing in June, a former Defense Department official who has worked closely on Lebanon and on the LAF policy, articulated this conventional wisdom: \"Hizballah doesn't need the Lebanese military's assets. The weapons it receives from Iran via Syria are substantially more sophisticated than any materiel that the United States has given Lebanon's military to date.\"\n\nIt should be clear now that this claim is simply false. At least three items in the US aid package to the LAF have been high up on Hezbollah's arms shopping list for close to a decade.\n\nImagining that the LAF will continue to refrain from passing on equipment in the future -- now that Hezbollah controls the Lebanese state, and is clearly the strongest military force in Lebanon -- takes a lot of faith. It's also irrelevant.\n\nLet's leave aside the fact that the LAF assisted Hezbollah in 2006 in nearly sinking an Israeli warship, and that LAF snipers twice in 2010 and 2013 shot at and killed Israeli soldiers across the border. And let's not get into the controversy over whether the US-origin armed personnel carriers that Hezbollah paraded in Syria last year came directly from the LAF -- or whether the LAF simply secured Hezbollah's logistical lines and waved them across as they moved heavy equipment into Syria. The bottom line is current US policy is feeding an army that operates in a political configuration entirely dominated and directed by Hezbollah and its commanders in Iran.\n\nWhat matters, in other words, is the address on the Pentagon's new package of military goodies -- not the name of the addressee.", "id": "9813935", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "The Pentagon Fills Hezbollah's Shopping List", "image": "http://www.tabletmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/laf-small.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3447, "date": "2015-10-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 3459}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "107", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "127", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "212", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of Lebanon"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "8206", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut", "label": {"eng": "Beirut"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}, "id": "303092", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}, "id": "304183", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}, "id": "315657", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}, "id": "316313", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah"}, {"label": {"eng": "Lebanese Armed Forces"}, "id": "318788", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Armed_Forces"}, {"label": {"eng": "2006 Lebanon War"}, "id": "337013", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}, "id": "439521", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah"}, {"label": {"eng": "Beirut\u2013Rafic Hariri International Airport"}, "id": "479023", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut\u2013Rafic_Hariri_International_Airport"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 163, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 735, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Guns"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 778, "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 907, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Firearms", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Firearms"}], "time": "03:08:00"}

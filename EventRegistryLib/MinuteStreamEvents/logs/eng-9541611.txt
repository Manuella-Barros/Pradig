His go-ahead goal came on a backhander 44 seconds into the third period, after his son had been taken home, and Dallas beat the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights 2-1 on Sunday night to wrap up the first-round series.\n\n\"I'm happy I did,\" Faksa said. \"And so I can show him the video in the morning, and we can watch it together.\"\n\nOnly captain Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin have played longer for the Stars than Faksa, a fourth-liner in his ninth season who got his goal from the circle to the left of goalie Adin Hill. Dallas also got another Game 7 goal from 20-year-old Wyatt Johnston.\n\nJake Oettinger had 21 saves in his second Game 7 victory. He also had the Stars' only penalty, though they killed that off after he was called for tripping Ivan Barbashev in front of the net midway through the third.\n\n\"The last period was a clinic. Just so proud of the guys of how we responded,\" Oettinger said. \"It's a long playoffs and you're going to need different guys to step up at different times. A lot of hockey left so hopefully a lot more heroes. It's going to be a run ride.\"\n\nThe Stars, the No. 1 seed in the West, move on to play well-rested Colorado in the second round.

We miss an open net at the end of the second, and they score on the first shift of the third. ... It's a little bit of hockey sometimes when two close teams play.\"\n\nThe series ended with both teams scoring 16 goals.\n\nVegas, which returned 22 of its 27 players from the Stanley Cup-winning roster, tied it in the second period when Michael Amadio made a crossing pass to Howden, who poked the puck into the open left side of the net behind Oettinger.\n\nThe only coach other than DeBoer to win eight Game 7s is Darryl Sutter, who was 8-3 in such games over 182 playoff games over 15 postseasons with four teams.\n\nThe Knights are 2-2 in Game 7s.

It's a little bit of hockey sometimes when two close teams play.\"\n\nThe series ended with both teams scoring 16 goals.\n\nVegas, which returned 22 of its 27 players from the Stanley Cup-winning roster, tied it in the second period when Michael Amadio made a crossing pass to Howden, who poked the puck into the open left side of the net behind Oettinger.\n\nThe only coach other than DeBoer to win eight Game 7s is Darryl Sutter, who was 8-3 in such games over 182 playoff games over 15 postseasons with four teams.\n\nThe Knights are 2-2 in Game 7s. DeBoer was also the opposing coach in their other loss, to San Jose in 2019.\n\nIt was only the second time of 16 that the Stars won a best-of-seven series after losing the first two games. The only other was the very first playoff series in franchise history, when the Minnesota North Stars were down 0-2 before beating the Los Angeles Kings in seven games to open the 1968 playoffs.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Faksa, who was back in the lineup after an injury, took a pass in the faceoff circle after the Stars' fourth line had cycled the puck. His shot beat a screened Vegas goalie Adin Hill.\n\n\"It was the biggest goal of my career,\" he told the TNT studio crew after the game. \"After every pregame skate, I play mini-stick hockey with my son and I promised him I would score a goal tonight and I'm glad I did. I'm so excited to show him the video of the goal in the morning.\"\n\nStars coach Peter DeBoer improved to 8-0 behind the bench in Game 7s as Dallas played a nearly perfect defensive game. The Stars held Vegas to 23 shots, blocked 24 shots and outhit the Golden Knights 49-37. Defenseman Chris Tanev, acquired at the trade deadline, had five blocked shots and five hits.\n\nThe only shot to get past Stars goalie Jake Oettinger was when Brett Howden deflected in a Michael Amadio pass off a rush in the second period. That tied the game 1-1.\n\nDallas' Wyatt Johnson scored the opening goal after a Golden Knights turnover in the first period.\n\nThe Golden Knights beat the Stars in the Western Conference final last season on the way to the Stanley Cup title. Dallas had home-ice advantage in this year's series as the Western Conference's top seed while Vegas dropped to the second wild-card spot because of injuries.\n\nThe Stars lost the first two games at home, but they advance after they won four of the last five games of the series, including Games 3-5.\n\n\"Up 2-0, it would have been nice to find a way to win one of those three games there,\" Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo told reporters. \"They made some adjustments, and I don't think we adjusted well enough right away. But that's on us as players to find a way, up 2-0, to get the job done.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Dallas Stars?\n\nThey head to the second round to face the Colorado Avalanche. They will have home-ice advantage in this series, too.\n\nColorado had a 3-1 record vs. the Stars in the regular season with the Avalanche winning one of the games in overtime.

DeBoer was also the opposing coach in their other loss, to San Jose in 2019.\n\nIt was only the second time of 16 that the Stars won a best-of-seven series after losing the first two games.

Nine players required surgery ,coach Bruce Cassidy said.\n\nThe Golden Knights used that to their advantage, going $8.72 million over the salary cap to sign multiple players and had a handful of players on IR return by the time the playoffs came around.\n\nCaptain Mark Stone, who suffered a lacerated spleen in February, was activated off long-term injured reserve before Game 1.\n\nForward William Carrier was activated off long-term injured reserve ahead of Game 1 after suffering an upper-body injury in late March.\n\nWhile Vegas was getting all of its talent back at the right time, the team struggled to adjust to playing with a full roster again.\n\n\"I give our guys a lot of credit. They played through a lot of injuries and trying to find chemistry with guys in and out,\" Cassidy said after Game 7. \"It took its toll eventually -- some of those surgeries.\"\n\n\"You're correcting a problem, but it takes a while to get back up to speed,\" he said.\n\nWhile Cassidy made multiple line changes after dropping Games 3 and 4 and switched out Logan Thompson for Adin Hill in goal, it didn't slow Dallas.\n\nIR also played a role in Vegas' seeding going into the playoffs.\n\nThe Golden Knights were nearly a completely different team in the playoffs but still had to face the top team in the West due to a 3-4 stretch to end the regular season.\n\nVegas was in a narrow battle with Los Angeles for who would get the No. 3 seed in the West to face Edmonton and who would slide into the final wild-card spot.\n\nA 4-1 loss to the Ducks, one of the worst teams in the league, in the Golden Knights' final game of the regular season sealed their fate.\n\nVegas had 2-0 lead in series and didn't close out\n\nThe Golden Knights had a chance to end the series in four games.\n\nThey took Games 1 and 2 on the road and were coming back home with a chance to sweep Dallas.\n\nCassidy said that Vegas' worst performance was in Game 3, where Thompson was peppered by 42 Star shots, and the Golden Knights lost 3-2 in overtime.\n\nIn Game 4, the Golden Knights competed for the majority of the game, but a second-period fall-off cost them the game, losing 4-2. That tied the series and sent it back to Dallas.\n\nIn game 5 the team lost composure after a penalty on Alex Pietrangelo led to a game-winning power-play goal by Jason Robertson in a 3-2 loss.\n\nWith its back against the wall, Vegas avoided elimination with a 2-0 win in Game 6 but eventually fell in Game 7 after Dallas scored the game-winning goal less than a minute into the third period.\n\nPietrangelo said after Game 7 that the team struggled to adjust to the changes Dallas made after Game 2.\n\n\"I don't think we adjusted well enough right away,\" defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \"That's on us as players to find a way up 2-0 to get the job done.\"\n\n\"We made mistakes along the way, but credit to them. They had a good season and good players,\" he said.\n\nStars adjusted to Vegas' aggressive approach\n\nOne of the biggest adjustments Dallas made was to the Golden Knights' aggressiveness, which was their bread-and-butter last season en route to a Stanley Cup.\n\nVegas averaged 44 hits a game compared to Dallas' 32. In the first three games of the series, the Golden Knights had at least 47 hits.\n\nBut that number dwindled deeper into the series, and the penalties rose. In Games 3, 4 and 5, Vegas took one more penalty than the Stars did.\n\nIn Game 4, Dallas scored a game-tying goal on the power play, and in Game 5, they scored two game-leading goals on the power play, which included the eventual winner.\n\nThe Stars also out-hit Vegas for the first time in the series in Game 7, 48 to 25.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_williams@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Jack Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adin Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Thompson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carrier_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Carrier (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2024/05/05/APTOPIX_Golden_Knights_Stars_Hockey_24127058590252_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Dallas defeated the Vegas Golden Knights on Sunday night in Game 7. This loss has ended the Golden Knights' championship defense, ensuring a new champion this year. Sunday's contest also saw Dallas end a rather longstanding franchise drought.\n\nThe Stars won the series in seven games but trailed in this series at one point. In fact, the Golden Knights won the first two games of this contest. Dallas winning this series snapped a 14-series losing streak in the Stanley Cup Playoffs when the team lost the first two games.\n\nIt's been nearly 60 years since the Stars lost the first two games in a series they won. You have to go back to 1968 to find the last time it happened, according to NHL.com's Taylor Baird. The franchise was in its first year in existence, and the team wasn't even in Dallas. They were the Minnesota North Stars at that time.\n\nStars eliminate Golden Knights\n\nThe Stars had home-ice advantage on Sunday night, and the fans made their voices heard. Dallas was loud anytime a green jersey skated with the puck, hanging on every move. Fans did not have to wait too long for the first goal of the contest, either. Forward Wyatt Johnson fired home a shot after a turnover to give Dallas the lead.\n\nDallas kept the Golden Knights at bay for most of the second period. However, Vegas did not back down, and were eventually rewarded for their efforts. After redirecting Michael Almadio's pass into the yawning goal, Brett Howden leveled the game. The Stars and Golden Knights went into the third period tied 1-1.\n\nEarly in the third, it was the home team that reclaimed the lead. Veteran forward Radek Faska scored on a backhand shot from the faceoff circle. He found the back of the net just 44 seconds into the final frame. Dallas had the momentum, but Vegas had more than enough time to equalize.\n\nThe Golden Knights fought with everything they had for that second goal. In the end, it wasn't meant to be. Stars goalie Jake Oettinger shut the door to finish off the 2-1 victory. Now, the Stars are looking ahead to the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nNathan MacKinnon, Avalanche await Dallas\n\nThe Stars are heading for a Central Division showdown in round two. Dallas is set to take on the Colorado Avalanche next. Colorado is certainly built for long playoff runs. The Avalanche fell in the first round last season to the Seattle Kraken. But in 2024, they defeated the Winnipeg Jets in five games to move on.\n\nColorado has a star-studded roster for the Stars to contend with. Headlining this group is forward Nathan MacKinnon. The Avalanche superstar is a Hart Trophy candidate this year after an incredible regular season.

The two tied NHL records for most Game 7 wins by a coach and skater, respectively.\n\nDallas also had home-ice advantage. The home team owns a 114-81 record all-time in Game 7s.\n\nThe Stars increased their likelihood of winning when scoring first, which Wyatt Johnston did late in the first period. The team that scores first is 147-48 in Game 7s historically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas is now 5-5 all-time in Game 7s and has won two consecutive, claiming the win-or-go-home matchup last season against Seattle.\n\nAdvertisementThe fourth line cashes in\n\nThe Stars' fourth line has been arguably the team's most consistent all series.\n\nWhile five different players have been on the line at points this series due to both injuries and adjustments by DeBoer, the fourth line came up with the biggest goal of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForty-four seconds into the fourth period, Radek Faksa scored on a backhanded shot to give Dallas a 2-1 lead. The veteran center did so after missing the last four games -- three with an injury and last game as the healthy scratch.\n\nCraig Smith and Thomas Harley had the assists.\n\nThe Stars' fourth line also accounted for the game-winner in Game 4 when Smith threw a puck at the net, which hit off Ty Dellandrea's arm and into the net.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the Vegas series last year, the Golden Knights' fourth line had a noticeable advantage in terms of forward depth. This year, Dallas was able to capitalize on its forward depth.\n\nMistakes prove costly on both sides\n\nIn a series with margins as thin as this one, capitalizing on mistakes is critical. Both teams managed to do so Sunday evening.\n\nJohnston came up with a phenomenal takeaway with under six minutes remaining in the first period on a pass from Shea Theodore to Tomas Hertl. The defensive-zone turnover for Vegas allowed Johnston to fire a shot past Adin Hill on the right side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second period, Vegas scored on a mistake by Dallas. Defenseman Nils Lundkvist led Brett Howden sneak by him to tip in a perfect pass by Michael Amadio and tie the score 1-1 with 4:35 remaining in the period.\n\nLundvkist did not see the ice again after that mistake.\n\nWyatt Johnston does it again\n\nThe 20-year-old forward has been Dallas' best player all series and gave his team a critical 1-0 lead in the first period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnston scored his fourth goal of the series and seventh point -- a series high -- when capitalizing on a turnover by Vegas in their zone.\n\nHe places a shot perfectly on Hill to give his team the lead.\n\nThe goal was Johnston's second in a Game 7 -- in just two Game 7s played. He scored the game-winning goal against Seattle in Game 7 last year.\n\nAdvertisementNew top line generates chances\n\nDeBoer brought some new lines for the Stars in Game 7, and they generated solid chances for Dallas, especially early on.\n\nLogan Stankoven and Joe Pavelski swapped positions, with the rookie joining the top line and Pavelski joining Jamie Benn and Johnston on the third line.\n\nStankoven entered the game on an 18-game scoring drought but had gotten close to scoring multiple times in the series. The Stars looked for some action from him by placing him on the top line less than three months into his NHL career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the line didn't score, it created some great opportunities for the Stars. Jason Robertson and Roope Hintz had a give-and-go late in the first period that nearly allowed Dallas to take a 2-0 lead.\n\nMidway in the second period, Stankoven made a beautiful play from the trapezoid to set up Hintz right in front of Hill. He missed high.\n\nIt was ultimately an effective change that set Dallas up for some chances it needed.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreLive updates: Dallas Stars outlast Vegas in Game 7, advance to face

On Sunday night, the Dallas Stars were the last team to punch their ticket to the second round by defeating the Vegas Golden Knights 2-1 at home in Game 7 of their series. Dallas will move on to tangle with the Colorado Avalanche. Moreover, with Vegas' elimination, there will officially not be a repeat champion in 2023-24.\n\nGiven the narrow 2-1 final score, one can assume that the match's outcome could have differed. They'd be quite right, more so than they probably imagine. Seconds before the hosts opened the scoring in the first period, the Golden Knights ringed the puck off the post of a gaping Dallas net. Moments later, the Stars applied pressure in Vegas' zone, producing a turnover that allowed Dallas sensation Wyatt Johnston to zip a wrist shot by Adin Hill.\n\nIn the second period, Jack Eichel made a move to the left of Jake Oettinger and had a chance at an open net but backhanded his shot into the side netting. To their credit, Vegas did level the terms via a Brett Howden goal.\n\nRelated: Dallas Stars' Logan Stankoven Has Unlimited Potential\n\nThe third period largely belonged to the Stars, and they made that known very early, with Radek Faksa backhanding a shot from the left circle into the top corner at 0:44. Rather than withstand a push from the Golden Knights, the Stars continued to press, looking for an insurance marker. With time winding down, Vegas began to show some desperation, but the host displayed excellent, aggressive defense, never allowing their rivals to achieve great scoring opportunities.

It ricocheted off a leg in front and past Vegas Golden Knights goalie Adin Hill for the game-winner in a 2-1 Stars victory that sent Dallas to the second round.\n\nFaksa hadn't scored in the playoffs -- or for more than a month -- prior to Sunday, but he scored the biggest goal of the season as the Stars edged the defending champion Golden Knights in another hard-fought game.\n\nJake Oettinger stopped 21 of 22 shots, and Dallas coach Peter DeBoer improved his record in Game 7s to 8-0 all-time. Dallas also earned some revenge against the team that eliminated them in the conference finals last year. The Stars now will face the Colorado Avalanche, who handled Winnipeg in five games, in the second round.\n\nWyatt Johnston, at age 20, has been great for the entirety of the series, and stepped up for Dallas in the biggest game of the season. He read Vegas defenseman Shea Theodore's pass out of the corner, intercepted the puck in the slot and rifled a shot underneath Adin Hill's glove to open the scoring late in the first period.\n\nJohnston was the Stars' best overall player across all seven games, leading the team in on-ice expected goal share (68.4 percent). He was on the ice for a team-high seven goals in this series.\n\nHis speed and skill are obvious, but Johnston has been just as effective with sustained zone time in these playoffs. He's not the biggest forward at 6-foot-1, 185 pounds, but he regularly finds his way to inside position against bigger opposition. He had nine shot attempts and three high-danger chances in Sunday's Game 7 alone.\n\nDeBoer has made a living taking away the best players on the opposing teams in the playoffs, and he was able to do it again in this one. Vegas' Mark Stone, Chandler Stephenson, Tomas Hertl, William Karlsson, Ivan Barbashev, Shea Theodore and Alex Pietrangelo were all held without a five-on-five goal in the first round.\n\nStone did contribute two key goals on the power play, and an empty-netter late in Game 6, but his offense creation at five-on-five was notably missing. Even Jack Eichel and Jonathan Marchessault - who were Vegas' best players throughout the series - both missed grade-A chances in Game 7 when the score was tied.\n\nWith both teams struggling to generate many dangerous looks, and Vegas' top players held off the scoresheet, the Golden Knights got a huge second-period tally from Brett Howden, thanks to an excellent pass by Michael Amadio.\n\nThe third-line wingers beat the Dallas defense up the ice, and Amadio drew Oettinger out of his crease before feeding a perfect pass to Howden on the backside of the play. Howden only had to deflect the puck into the wide-open net to tie the game 1-1.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't enough to overcome the void, but Vegas' depth players showed well on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_granger@theathletic.com", "name": "Jesse Granger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adin Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Theodore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shea Theodore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Barbashev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Barbashev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Eichel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Eichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Karlsson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Karlsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marchessault", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Marchessault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Howden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Howden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Hertl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Stephenson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Dominoes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Dominoes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/05221042/GettyImages-2151624338-scaled-e1714961523254.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Place a big checkmark in the Stars' corner following their 2-1 victory Sunday night in the seventh consecutive tight, tense game that Vegas and Dallas played.\n\nThe Stars advanced because of their superior scoring depth, something that served this team well en route to finishing first in the Western Conference. Dallas was the only NHL team with eight 20-game scorers and they went beyond that level in this series with big goals from Evgenii Dadonov, Ty Dellandrea and finally, desperately, a third-period Game 7 game-winning backhand off the stick of Radek Faksa. It's a testament to the manner in which GM Jim Nill built this club, to how veteran coach Pete DeBoer has guided them and to the players' belief in a system that works.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nNow all they need is more.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWith no real rest, the Stars will host Colorado on Tuesday, a much different team from Vegas even though the Avs won the Stanley Cup the year before the Golden Knights prevailed. If Dallas can dispose of the last two champions before reaching the Western Conference finals, it feels as if the Stars can handle any challenge thrown their direction. But keep in mind Colorado plays a different style than the strong defensive Golden Knights.\n\nPut it this way. Dallas and Vegas each scored 16 goals in the tightest seven-game series you will ever see where every goal was huge, where scoring chances were things to cherish. The Avalanche has been waiting patiently for this series to end after disposing of Winnipeg in five games. Colorado outscored the Jets 27-15 in the first round. Whereas no team got to five goals in seven Dallas-Vegas games, Colorado scored at least five goals every night against the Jets. And Winnipeg has the division's best goaltender in Connor Hellebuyck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado made a four-time Vezina Trophy look like a journeyman backup with an .870 save percentage. The Stars' Jake Oettinger was much better in the second week of this Vegas series than he was in the first week, but he could be great and not hold Colorado to barely two goals a night as he did against Vegas.\n\nThe Stars can't live with zero points in seven games from Joe Pavelski. They can't survive with one point (an empty-net goal) in seven games from Roope Hintz. It's fine to get special play from 20-year-old Wyatt Johnston, and there's no reason for that not to continue. We are no longer surprised by anything he does, even when he opened the Game 7 scoring with an unassisted goal 14 minutes into the first period.\n\nThe Stars' depth allows DeBoer to spread the scoring talent among three lines (make it four when Faksa or Dellandrea add to the mix), but Dallas has to nail a higher percentage of its scoring chances than it did against Vegas. When chances come Jamie Benn's or Matt Duchene's way as they did ever so briefly in Game 7, they can't fire high and wide. Colorado even sports a hot goalie (unusual for the Avs) in Alexandar Georgiev, who won four straight while holding the Jets to eight goals in the last four games after losing a wild 7-6 opener.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo it's a quick turnaround and a wildly different challenge that greets Dallas, but that doesn't mean the Stars aren't up to the task. It took them a minute -- well, 120 minutes, to be frank -- to get their game to the level they needed to steal the flow away from Vegas and become the aggressor with the superior scoring chances. In the process, they won four of five games from the defending champs and restored a little home pride by winning the last two games at the AAC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado won three out of four games against Dallas in the regular season, and the Avs roughed up Oettinger a fair amount. You really have to wonder if DeBoer can keep playing just five defensemen most of the time (Nils Lundkvist played 3:09 Sunday night, which was not far below his average for the series).\n\nThat's why it's imperative that the big scorers -- Jason Robertson and Hintz and some sort of revival from Pavelski and, of course, Johnston -- perform in this next round. It's not like the Stars have completely forgotten how to put the puck in the net. In fact, only one team in the West outscored Dallas. That team is coming to town after scoring 27 goals in five nights (5.4 average) against the team that yielded the fewest goals in the NHL this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a task the Stars can handle, but don't make the mistake of thinking they already faced their toughest foe.\n\nChampions no more: See photos from Dallas Stars' Game 7 elimination of Vegas Golden Knights at American

For the last several years the Stars have been the \"Stanley Cup\" winner that just hasn't quite been good enough to actually win the Stanley Cup.\n\nAt some point, even if you're getting close, any organization looks inward and asks themselves, \"What are we doing wrong?\" (The exception to this rule is the Dallas Cowboys).\n\nStars owner Tom Gaglardi loves this sport, knows just enough to be dangerous, and there is a good chance he would have pushed to do something dramatic. The Stars had not been doing anything wrong, they just weren't quite good enough.\n\nNo team exposed that reality better than the Knights, the defending Stanley Cup champion who ended the Stars' season in the 2023 Western Conference finals. If the Stars were going to ever prove to the rest of the NHL, and themselves, they are worthy of a Cup run, they had to get by this team.\n\nA team of computer scientists could not have constructed two teams any closer. They are literally one goal apart. In the 2024 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Stars were on the right side of that goal.\n\nThe Stars defeated the Golden Knights 2-1 in Game 7 on Sunday night to advance to the Western Conference semifinals to face the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nThe Stars trailed this series 0-2, and should have been knocked out but advanced on for a reason. This is a good, well built team that just desperately needed a few things to break right in order to move on to the next round.\n\n\"Talking to their team, (Las Vegas) wanted back-to-back and they felt like they had the team to do it. A lot of people after the second game agreed with that,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said after the win. \"There was a lot on the line for us, too, just because of the season we had.\"\n\nA small understatement. The Stars had the most points of any team in the Western Conference, and earned the No. 1 seed for the playoffs. When the one seed goes out in the first round, hell isn't too far behind.\n\n\"It would have been really disappointing to be out in the first round,\" DeBoer said. \"It wouldn't have been as disappointing for me this year compared to last year to lose to Vegas, just because of how great of a team they are. The disappointing part would have been all of the work we put in this year, and how we played over the course of the season, to earn the No. 1 seed.\n\n\"To get that draw, and to get ousted, would have been hard to swallow.\"\n\nHad the Stars lost on Sunday night, it would have been this team's worst playoff loss the spring of 1997. That season, the Stars had the second-most points in the conference, but lost in Game 7 of their first round series at home against the Edmonton Oilers.\n\nA fortunate third period goal from Stars forward Radek Faksa 44 seconds into the third period was the final margin, but the Stars won this game thanks to team defense, and a goalie, that did not give Vegas any opportunities but maybe three.\n\nBy coming back to defeat the Golden Knights, the Stars avoided what would have been a horrible month of May. And probably June, too. A lot of veterans would have been looking at their phones, and maybe a few staffers, too.\n\nBy coming back to defeat the Golden Knights, the Stars can move forward knowing all of these disaster scenarios are off the table.\n\nBy coming back to defeat the Golden Knights, the Stars advance to play this franchise's most celebrated rival, the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nBy coming back to defeat the Golden Knights, the Stanley Cup the Stars covet is theirs to win.\n\nEven though it was the first round, and they were playing the eight seed, the Dallas Stars just cleared the team they had to beat to prove to themselves, and probably their owner, too, they can do this.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mac_engel@star-telegram.com", "name": "Mac Engel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Gaglardi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Gaglardi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/All-Stars", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/266fp8/picture288336645/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Stars-WIN.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The two tied NHL records for most Game 7 wins by a coach and skater, respectively.\n\nDallas also had home-ice advantage. The home team owns a 114-81 record all-time in Game 7s.\n\nThe Stars increased their likelihood of winning when scoring first, which Wyatt Johnston did late in the first period. The team that scores first is 147-48 in Game 7s historically.\n\nDallas is now 5-5 all-time in Game 7s and has won two consecutive, claiming the win-or-go-home matchup last season against Seattle.\n\nThe fourth line cashes in\n\nThe Stars' fourth line has been arguably the team's most consistent all series.\n\nWhile five different players have been on the line at points this series due to both injuries and adjustments by DeBoer, the fourth line came up with the biggest goal of the season.\n\nForty-four seconds into the fourth period, Radek Faksa scored on a backhanded shot to give Dallas a 2-1 lead. The veteran center did so after missing the last four games -- three with an injury and last game as the healthy scratch.\n\nCraig Smith and Thomas Harley had the assists.\n\nThe Stars' fourth line also accounted for the game-winner in Game 4 when Smith threw a puck at the net, which hit off Ty Dellandrea's arm and into the net.\n\nIn the Vegas series last year, the Golden Knights' fourth line had a noticeable advantage in terms of forward depth. This year, Dallas was able to capitalize on its forward depth.\n\nMistakes prove costly on both sides\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nIn a series with margins as thin as this one, capitalizing on mistakes is critical. Both teams managed to do so Sunday evening.\n\nJohnston came up with a phenomenal takeaway with under six minutes remaining in the first period on a pass from Shea Theodore to Tomas Hertl. The defensive-zone turnover for Vegas allowed Johnston to fire a shot past Adin Hill on the right side.\n\nIn the second period, Vegas scored on a mistake by Dallas. Defenseman Nils Lundkvist led Brett Howden sneak by him to tip in a perfect pass by Michael Amadio and tie the score 1-1 with 4:35 remaining in the period.\n\nLundvkist did not see the ice again after that mistake.\n\nWyatt Johnston does it again\n\nThe 20-year-old forward has been Dallas' best player all series and gave his team a critical 1-0 lead in the first period.\n\nJohnston scored his fourth goal of the series and seventh point -- a series high -- when capitalizing on a turnover by Vegas in their zone.\n\nHe places a shot perfectly on Hill to give his team the lead.\n\nThe goal was Johnston's second in a Game 7 -- in just two Game 7s played. He scored the game-winning goal against Seattle in Game 7 last year.\n\nNew top line generates chances\n\nDeBoer brought some new lines for the Stars in Game 7, and they generated solid chances for Dallas, especially early on.\n\nLogan Stankoven and Joe Pavelski swapped positions, with the rookie joining the top line and Pavelski joining Jamie Benn and Johnston on the third line.\n\nStankoven entered the game on an 18-game scoring drought but had gotten close to scoring multiple times in the series. The Stars looked for some action from him by placing him on the top line less than three months into his NHL career.\n\nWhile the line didn't score, it created some great opportunities for the Stars. Jason Robertson and Roope Hintz had a give-and-go late in the first period that nearly allowed Dallas to take a 2-0 lead.\n\nMidway in the second period, Stankoven made a beautiful play from the trapezoid to set up Hintz right in front of Hill. He missed high.\n\nIt was ultimately an effective change that set Dallas up for some chances it needed.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

That stood up as the series clincher in the razor-thin 2-1 victory.\n\nAlthough the fourth line forward isn't known to score goals -- especially not in the postseason -- Faksa admitted that he told his son he would hit the scoresheet in the winner-take-all contest.\n\n\"After every pre-game skate I play mini-stick hockey with my son, and I promised him I would score a goal tonight,\" the veteran told the NHL on TNT panel after the monumental victory. \"I'm glad I did. I'm so excited to show him the video of the goal in the morning. I'm so happy.\"\n\nFaksa also admitted to the TNT crew that the tally was \"the biggest goal of my career so far,\" which goes without saying. The forward scored one playoff goal in 19 tries in the 2023 postseason, helping the Stars get to Game 6 of the Western Conference Final.\n\nIt took him just three games in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs to replicate that production, and the goal will not soon be forgotten by the Dallas faithful. Whether or not the Stars are able to get to back-to-back WCF's, they at least won't have to worry about the team that beat them in that series. They've exorcised their demons and achieved revenge.\n\nAnd there will be a new Stanley Cup champion in 2024 because of Faksa's series-clinching tally.\n\n\"Really wanted to win this series. We wanted our turn,\" said Stars coach Pete DeBoer, who improved to a perfect 8-0 in Game 7's. \"We felt we did all the right things all year to get the first seed, and then you draw a team like Vegas. I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. To plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot to unpack.\"\n\nRevenge is oh-so-sweet for Stars\n\nIt was an incredible playoff turnaround for the 2023-24 Stars after winning the Central Division. Despite a terrific regular-season, drawing the defending Stanley Cup champions in Round 1 was probably worst-case scenario for this club.\n\nAnd the Stars looked to be going quietly after losing the first two games of the series on home ice. But after flipping the script with three straight wins -- and despite failing to close in Game 6 -- the squad finally got the job done in front of a raucous crowd at the American Airlines Center.\n\n\"I'm so proud of the guys for how we responded going down 0-2,\" said goaltender Jake Oettinger, who stopped 22 of the 23 shots he faced in the triumph. \"H**l of a win.\"\n\nFor the Golden Knights, it's only the third time in seven years of existence that the team has failed to win a playoff series. Even with the additions of Noah Hanifin, Tomas Hertl and Anthony Mantha, they were unable to get the job done.\n\nIt goes to show how good of a hockey team the Stars are in 2024. They proved it all regular-season, and have now dispatched last year's champion and proved they are for real in the playoffs.\n\nNext up is a heavyweight battle for the Central Division crown, with Radek Faksa and co. getting ready to welcome the high-flying Avalanche in Game 1 on Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_gallant@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Colin Gallant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adin Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_on_TNT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL on TNT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Hanifin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noah Hanifin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Hertl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mantha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mantha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Radek-Faksa-promised-son-he-would-score-in-Game-7-Biggest-goal-of-my-career.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Johnston intercepted Shea Theodore's clearing pass by the left boards, then cut into the high slot, where he fired a wrist shot past Hill's glove side.\n\nJohnston's score came shortly after Vegas forward Jonathan Marchessault, alone by the left side of the goal, hit the post while shooting at a wide-open net following a rebound.\n\n\"It was so much fun. It's what we all grow up dreaming of as hockey players, you want to play in the Game 7's,\" Johnston said after the game. \"So much energy in the building. The fans were awesome.

And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars.\n\n\"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\" DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they\u00b4ve got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there\u00b4s a lot there to unpack.\"\n\nAfter losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don\u00b4t think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nVegas Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy, left rear, and a member of his staff leave the bench after the team's 3-2 loss against the Dallas Stars in Game 5 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup first-round playoff series in Dallas, Wednesday, May 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)\n\nVegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve.\n\n\"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\"\n\nStone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t think anyone in this room thought we weren\u00b4t going to have an opportunity to win,\" Pietrangelo said.\n\n\"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I\u00b4m sure Dallas wasn\u00b4t thrilled to play us in the first round either,\" Stone said. \"It\u00b4s disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We\u00b4ll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\n\nDeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.\n\nThe coach has been part of all four of the Game 7s for the Knights, who are 2-2 in those games. DeBoer was their coach for the wins in 2020 and 2021, and on San Jose's bench when the Sharks beat them in 2019.\n\n\"They wanted to go back-to-back, and I think they felt they had a team to do it,\" DeBoer said. \"There was a lot on the line for us too, I think just because of the season we had. ...

They made the splashiest of trade deadline acquisitions. They played some of their best hockey at the end of the season.\n\nEven the much-maligned goaltending played a part in keeping the Knights alive for seven games against the Dallas Stars.\n\nBut the Knights learned what many defending NHL champions have endured since the turn of the century: The grind to stay at the mountaintop for 730 consecutive days is never an easy one.\n\nThere will be a new Stanley Cup champion this season.\n\nThe Knights lost 2-1 in Game 7 of their first-round series against the Stars at American Airlines Center on Sunday to end their chances of winning back-to-back championships.\n\n\"We felt like we definitely had a team that had a chance to go on a long run,\" said Stone, the Knights' captain. \"It's never easy coming in as an eight seed and beating the top teams at the start.\"\n\nThe rematch of last season's Western Conference Final was better suited for that spotlight again. It would have been worthy of a Stanley Cup Final sans seeding and conferences.\n\nIt was the least typical 1-versus-8 matchup that could have delivered on the playoff scale. The final score was decided by one goal four times, and the other three times needed an empty-net goal.\n\nLeft wing Brett Howden scored the lone goal, and goaltender Adin Hill made 22 saves to give the Knights a chance.\n\nThe winning goal came 44 seconds into the third period when Stars left wing Radek Faksa -- returning after missing the previous four games with an undisclosed injury -- had a shot go off defenseman Alec Martinez's shin and trickle over Hill's shoulder.\n\nThe Knights scored four and three goals in Games 1 and 2, respectively. They were held to two or fewer in each of the final five games.\n\nBut they still had a chance to win the series.\n\n\"We just needed to find another goal for Adin tonight,\" coach Bruce Cassidy said.\n\nSuch a tight series was going to require a mistake or fortunate bounce. The Stars got both.\n\nRight wing Jonathan Marchessault hit a post with 5:38 remaining in the first period. The puck trickled down the ice with defenseman Shea Theodore retrieving it near the goal line.\n\nHis backhand clear was intercepted by Dallas center Wyatt Johnston, and the Stars' young phenom scored eight seconds later to open the scoring.\n\nHowden tied the score 1-1 at 15:25 on a tic-tac-toe goal from center William Karlsson and right wing Michael Amadio.\n\nCenter Jack Eichel almost gave the Knights the lead with 43 seconds left in the second period but missed an open net.\n\nDallas scored the go-ahead goal on its first shift in the third.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this room ever thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\" defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \"Tonight, I think we played a pretty good game.\"\n\nEverything lined up perfectly for the Knights in the series.\n\nAfter winning the first two games in Dallas, the Knights acknowledged that things would have been different had they found a way to win one of the first two games at T-Mobile Arena.\n\nDallas found new life and is moving on because of it. The Stars will face the Colorado Avalanche in the second round.\n\nThe Knights now will ponder what could have been. It will be at least another year without a back-to-back champion.\n\nThey will start again in September with the hopes of trying that again.\n\n\"I'm proud of the team. We battled a ton of adversity,\" Stone said. \"We found a way to get in the playoffs, and we did give ourselves a chance to win this series.\"\n\nThe Stars' top players, mainly Johnston, scored when they needed to.\n\nThe Knights didn't get that.\n\nEichel went the final three games without a goal. Marchessault didn't score again after Game 2. Left wing Tomas Hertl's lone goal came on the power play in Game 1.\n\nStone's two goals came on the power play, and he didn't look comfortable at five-on-five throughout. Center Chandler Stephenson had one point.\n\nDallas' defense and goaltender Jake Oettinger did more than enough to keep the Knights' top players in check.\n\n2. Flooded with injuries\n\nCassidy confirmed postgame that Karlsson was dealing with a lower-body injury that hindered his ability.\n\nIt's why Karlsson had different linemates ranging from Hertl to Howden throughout the series and why he was limited on faceoffs.\n\nCassidy said nine players had surgeries during the season.\n\n3. Goaltenders strong until the end\n\nHill and Thompson did everything they could to give the Knights a chance.\n\nIt was a risk for Cassidy to move from Thompson to Hill in Game 5. Though the Knights lost two of the final three games, Hill allowed just four goals, including a shutout in Game 6.\n\nThe Knights went into the season with full confidence in their tandem. While shaky at times, that confidence is restored heading into next season.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Eichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Eichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Theodore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shea Theodore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Karlsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Karlsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adin Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marchessault", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Marchessault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Howden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brett Howden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Amadio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Amadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Hertl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Educational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Golden_Knights_Stars_Hockey_21.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes, it comes down to a gritty goal from an unexpected hero.\n\nThe Stars learned that earlier this postseason when the goals didn't come easy. Low-scoring affairs and key performances from depth players allowed them to crawl back into the series after trailing 0-2.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen tied 1-1 with 20 minutes remaining in regulation of Game 7 on Sunday, the Stars needed a boost, and coach Pete DeBoer put his fourth line on the ice, as he did to start each period of the game. That line -- as it has all series -- delivered.\n\nAdvertisementSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nVeteran centerman Radek Faksa threw a backhanded shot at the net, likely looking for a rebound, but it found its way past goalie Adin Hill. It gave the Stars a 2-1 lead just 44 seconds into the period and ultimately was the game-winning goal in a win-or-go-home situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaksa became the hero in just his third playoff game of the season. He sustained an injury late in Game 2 and was sidelined for the Stars' three wins that followed. In Game 6, while he was an option, he was ultimately scratched.\n\nBut after Vegas pulled out a 2-0 win to send the series to Game 7, DeBoer chose to return Faksa to the lineup.\n\nIt was a decision that clinched the series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's tough to watch the games from up there,\" Faksa said. \"You're more nervous watching the games from the seats than on the bench playing. I had a tough time. I was just happy to be back.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaksa was the unlikely hero after an up-and-down season. Known for his faceoff and penalty-killing abilities, he struggled to score for much of the season, especially in the early half.\n\nThe 30-year-old scored just three goals in his first 54 games of the season. He was injured for four games but also a healthy scratch for four. That decision to keep him out of the lineup sent a message that more was expected of him.\n\nIn the latter half of the season, Faksa scored four goals in his last 20 games. He finished the regular season with 19 points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut his biggest point of all came at the 44-second mark of the third period Sunday. It was his first point in a Game 7 despite being a part of six in his time in Dallas.\n\nThe effort from Dallas' fourth line was a key factor in the Stars winning the series.\n\nDeBoer said it would be early in the playoffs. In last year's Western Conference finals, the Golden Knights' fourth line outplayed Dallas'. Both lines had three goals in that series, but Dallas' only contributed in Game 5.\n\nThis series, William Carrier had the only fourth-line goal for Vegas in Game 5, and Dallas' line had two -- Faksa and one from Ty Dellandrea in Game 4. Both were game-winners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They stepped up huge,\" Stars captain Jamie Benn said. \"They were great tonight. I thought they were great all seven games, even Ty Dellandrea stepping in when he needed to.

(AP Photo/Brandon Wade)DALLAS (AP) - Dallas Stars coach Pete DeBoer had so many emotions to process after a Game 7 victory over his former team. There were those mixed feelings still from last year, when the Vegas Golden Knights beat Dallas in the Western Conference Final and that team for which he had such a great affection went on to win its first Stanley Cup. And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars. \"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\"\u009d DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot there to unpack.\"\u009d After losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point. \"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\"\u009d said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\u009d The Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg. Vegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve. \"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\" Stone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season. \"I don't think anyone in this room thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\"\u009d Pietrangelo said. \"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I'm sure Dallas wasn't thrilled to play us in the first round either,\"\u009d Stone said. \"It's disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We'll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\u009d DeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.

Dallas coach Pete DeBoer improved to 8-0 in Games 7s in his career to get his team to the second round. The Knights now have a long offseason to reflect on how the series slipped away.\n\n\"Last year was the most fun I think all of us ever had playing the game of hockey in this league, for sure,\" Knights captain Mark Stone said. \"We want to get back there. It's not easy to repeat. Doesn't happen often. But at the same time, we believe we should be competing for the Stanley Cup every year.\"\n\nEverything seemed to be going the Knights' way entering the playoffs.\n\nStone returned after missing the final two months with a lacerated spleen. Him being placed on long-term injured reserve allowed the Knights to acquire defenseman Noah Hanifin, center Tomas Hertl and right wing Anthony Mantha on retained salary at the trade deadline.\n\nThanks to the newcomers and the play of goaltender Logan Thompson, the team went 10-5-1 its final 16 games to reach the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons.\n\n\"There's some obvious difficulties and some positives,\" coach Bruce Cassidy said. \"We came out of the gate (to start the season) really well. Then, adversity kind of kicks in. I give our guys a lot of credit. They played through a lot of injury and trying to find chemistry with guys. I think some of it took its toll eventually.\"\n\nSo, what changed? Why are the Knights heading home early?\n\nStone returned from his second back surgery in less than a year at the beginning of last postseason and found his stride by Game 2.\n\nThis time the Knights captain never quite looked like himself.\n\nStone had three goals in the series but two came on the power play and one went into an empty net. He never looked comfortable at five-on-five.\n\nThe 31-year-old did not make excuses. He said he was healthy enough to return to the lineup, so he felt he should've contributed.\n\n\"Would I have liked to produce another goal in Game 7 to help us win the hockey game? Of course. I think there's a lot of guys that would've,\" Stone said. \"It's not the easiest thing in the world, but at the end of the day, if you're going to go out there, you have to go out there to produce and help your team win games.\"\n\nCassidy said back in training camp the NHL is a copycat league and teams would try to emulate what the Knights did to win a championship.\n\nThey dominated at five-on-five last postseason. Dallas returned the favor in this series.\n\nThe Stars held a clear advantage in every key stat at five-on-five -- scoring chances (193-139), high-danger chances (79-49) and goals (11-9).\n\nDallas put on a masterclass on keeping the Knights to the outside of the offensive zone. The series could've ended much sooner if Thompson and Adin Hill didn't do a stellar job of limiting the Stars' offense themselves.\n\nThe rest of the Knights' defensemen didn't chip in much offensively.\n\nThe blue line combined for 11 points in the series. Hanifin and McNabb each had five. Alex Pietrangelo earned the other with an assist.\n\nPietrangelo played well in Games 6 and 7 but took poor penalties in Games 4 and 5 that led to Dallas goals.\n\nShea Theodore finished without a point and had several crucial turnovers. His fumbled puck at the blue line led to center Roope Hintz's empty-net goal that sealed Game 4. Center Wyatt Johnston also took the puck away from Theodore before the Stars' first goal in Game 7.\n\nThe Knights' defense corps was considered one of the main reasons they became champions last season. This series wasn't their best.\n\n4. Hertl couldn't find a home\n\nOne challenge Cassidy couldn't solve was where to put his newest player.\n\nHertl, who only played six regular-season games with the Knights, moved around all series. He started at second-line left wing, shifted to the third line to take faceoffs for the injured William Karlsson and finished on the top line with center Jack Eichel and right wing Jonathan Marchessault.\n\nHertl was a minus-6 in the series. He never looked comfortable or settled given his limited reps with his new teammates.\n\nA full offseason should help him look more like the player the Knights hoped to acquire. Hertl will get more time to heal from his February knee surgery and a full training camp to acclimate. He should also be able to stick at center full-time if center Chandler Stephenson, an unrestricted free agent, leaves this offseason.\n\n5. Johnston's impact\n\nThe Knights had no answer for Dallas' young phenom.\n\nJohnston, who turns 21 on May 14, scored his fourth goal of the series Sunday. He was a menace and led the Stars with 40 scoring chances in the series in all situations.\n\nSecond on Dallas was captain Jamie Benn with 21.\n\nThe Stars' young core of Johnston, 22-year-old defenseman Thomas Harley and 21-year-old left wing Logan Stankoven made a huge different compared to the Western Conference Final between the two teams a year ago. The Knights, on the other hand, got just one game from 23-year-old left wing Pavel Dorofeyev. He played 7:11 in Game 5 before being benched in the second period.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Stars are heading toward the NHL playoffs with the league's most balanced scoring team. (Fred Greenslade/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- Dallas Stars coach Pete DeBoer had so many emotions to process after a Game 7 victory over his former team.\n\nThere were those mixed feelings still from last year, when the Vegas Golden Knights beat Dallas in the Western Conference Final and that team for which he had such a great affection went on to win its first Stanley Cup. And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars.\n\n\"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\" DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot there to unpack.\"\n\nAfter losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nVegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve.\n\n\"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\"\n\nStone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this room thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\" Pietrangelo said.\n\n\"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I'm sure Dallas wasn't thrilled to play us in the first round either,\" Stone said. \"It's disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We'll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\n\nDeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.\n\nThe coach has been part of all four of the Game 7s for the Knights, who are 2-2 in those games. DeBoer was their coach for the wins in 2020 and 2021, and on San Jose's bench when the Sharks beat them in 2019.\n\n\"They wanted to go back-to-back, and I think they felt they had a team to do it,\" DeBoer said. \"There was a lot on the line for us too, I think just because of the season we had. ... All the work that we've put in this year, and how well we've played over the course of the season to earn the No. 1 seed, to get that draw and get ousted would have been hard to swallow.\"\n\nInstead, DeBoer got to celebrate with a few beers and look ahead to another series.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He had three shots on goal, two hits and two blocked shots. He was also on the ice for both Stars goals and finished with a plus-2 rating.\n\n2. Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger -- Oettinger settled in this series after a shaky Game 1 and was a major reason why his team advanced. He didn't allow more than two goals in any of the final six games and stopped 21 of 22 shots he faced in Game 7. Oettinger allowed just one goal in the third period or overtime this series.\n\n1. Stars center Wyatt Johnston -- He was tremendous all series long and Sunday was no exception. Johnston put the Stars up 1-0 with 5:26 left in the first period with a tremendous individual effort. He took the puck away in the offensive zone and beat goaltender Adin Hill for an unassisted goal. The 20-year-old finished with four shots on goal and six hits, tied for the game high.\n\nKey play\n\nRadek Faksa's goal 44 seconds into of the third period.\n\nFaksa, playing for the first time since Game 2 because of an undisclosed injury, returned to provide the game winner and series clincher.\n\nThere wasn't much to the buildup.\n\nFaksa didn't have room to operate in the offensive zone and decided to throw a backhand shot on net. Hill appeared to have it covered, but the puck deflected off defenseman Alec Martinez's leg and into the net to give Dallas a 2-1 lead. The Stars never looked back.\n\nKey stat\n\n8-0: Stars coach Pete DeBoer improved to 8-0 all-time in Game 7s, matching the record for most wins in such games in major team sports history.\n\nFamed Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach was also 8-0 in Game 7s.\n\nLongtime NHL coach Darryl Sutter is the only other coach in the NHL, NBA or Major League Baseball with eight Game 7 victories, but he also lost three times in such situations.\n\nNotable\n\nThe Knights were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second time.\n\nThey lost in Game 7 in both instances. They were also coming off an appearance in a Stanley Cup Final both times and facing a team coached by DeBoer. They lost to DeBoer's San Jose Sharks in overtime in Game 7 in 2019.\n\nThe Knights now begin an important offseason earlier than expected. They have several key questions to answer, like what will happen with pending free agent Jonathan Marchessault.\n\nThe defending Conn Smythe winner did not score a goal in any of the final five games of the series.

One elite team beating another this early is always a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe Stars, though, aren't going to make any apologies. With a 2-1 Game 7 win over the Golden Knights, they got a measure of revenge for last season's loss in the Western Conference final. They also came back from a 2-0 series deficit for the first time in franchise history.\n\nOn to the next one. The Stars are facing Colorado in a second-round series that, go figure, could double as a conference final -- and they've got the mix necessary to come out on top.\n\nAfter a solid rookie season, Johnston looked his age against the Golden Knights last spring. Not only was he held off the scoresheet in last year's series, but Vegas outscored the Stars 5-0 and controlled play when Johnston was on the ice.\n\nJohnston rebounded from that with a breakout regular season. He's helped the Stars shed their top-heavy identity and bolstered their depth with reliable secondary scoring. In 82 regular-season games, he scored 65 points, primarily earned at five-on-five. The Stars were a better team in his minutes, thanks to his volume shooting and ability to drive right to the scoring areas even against top defenders. And this year, that difference-making play carried into the playoffs.\n\nAfter a solid start in Games 1 and 2, where he attempted 17 shots, 10 of which qualified as scoring chances per Natural Stat Trick, Johnston became the difference-maker the Stars needed. Dallas out-shot Vegas 30-15 with him on the ice. Fourteen of those attempts came off Johnston's stick, and two beat Logan Thompson in key moments: the opening goal of the game and the overtime game-winner.\n\nIn Game 7, Johnston notched his third goal and seventh point of the series to get the Stars on the board. All together through Round 1, he elevated Dallas to earn almost 69 percent of the expected goals share while outsourcing Vegas 5-3. At five-on-five, Johnston created 33 scoring chances which leads all skaters through Round 1 -- that's 34 percent of what the Stars generated in his minutes, a lopsided 77-45 chances over Vegas.\n\nAn elite core is the star ingredient to creating a Stanley Cup. But a team needs a strong supporting cast and cost-effective contracts to contracts to balance out pricier ones. Johnston's bringing both and he's just getting started.\n\nIn October, Jake Oettinger was one of the main reasons to believe in the Stars as true Cup contenders. What, exactly, were we supposed to dislike about the guy? He was 24 years old and had gotten progressively better in each of his three NHL seasons. He'd followed a star turn in a 2022 playoff loss to Calgary with a .919 save percentage and more than 21 goals saved above expected, eighth-best in the league in 2022-23.\n\nThat's part of what made his uneven regular-season performance such a surprise; at certain points, he seemed more like a reason to bet against the Stars than bet on them. After the trade deadline, though, he locked in, putting up a .924 save percentage and saving more than five goals above expected. Like we said in our series preview -- if that's what Dallas could expect from him in the playoffs, look out.\n\nLo and behold, that's what they got. Oettinger posted a .925 save percentage against Vegas. Of the 14 goals he allowed, just 10 came in the final six games. He showed a particular knack for locking things down as games progressed and stopped 21 of the 22 shots he faced in Game 7.\n\nIf he keeps that up, Oettinger won't just give Dallas an edge in net over Colorado; he'll give them an edge over most of their potential opponents.\n\nThose middle-six contributions for Dallas were clutch in Round 1 because the top line hasn't played to their usual star potential.\n\nJason Robertson, Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski have set a high bar. They've been a staple at the top of the Stars' lineup for the last three and a half years for good reason. The line brings a little bit of everything between each player's skill set that helps them click.\n\nThat hasn't been the case just yet in the playoffs. Through seven games against the Golden Knights, that top line only mustered 41 percent of the expected goals share and was outscored 1-0.\n\nRobertson at least earned five points in Round 1 while Hintz is a bit of a red flag at just one. But this isn't the level the Stars should expect moving forward. There are two things working in Dallas' favor: It isn't as if these players wilt in a postseason environment and they have proof otherwise from the last few seasons.\n\nPlus, the coaches know there are other combinations to mix and match if needed. Moving Johnston to the top line helped unlock Roberston and Hintz in Game 1, while Pavelski worked with Jamie Benn and Johnston in Game 7. Dallas has a versatile lineup, so with the right tweaks the Stars should be able to stack up better to Colorado's best.\n\nPete DeBoer's Game 7 record stays sparkling, and one deployment decision stands out: Limiting Nils Lundkvist's minutes and basically rotating only five defensemen.\n\nIn Round 1 Lundkvist played only 31:42, or 4:31 on average per game in all situations. In total, that's only about four minutes more than Heiskanen's 27:26 average ice time through seven games.\n\nAnd in Game 7, it was clear exactly why the coaches felt they had to shelter him. A costly mistake contributed to Brett Howden's tying goal, which could have opened the door to Vegas winning this series.\n\nWhile Lundkvist adds an element of skill to the Stars' blue line, he has also been a liability at times -- even in super-sheltered usage. That explains why he barely played in Game 7 (or much at all after going down 0-2 in the series) and why the coaches are going to have to be ultra-careful against Colorado. The Avalanche have so much speed and skill that someone like Lundkvist could easily be exposed.\n\nFor now, the decision looks smart. But the deeper the Stars go, the more they may need to share the burden on defense to avoid burning out some of their best players.\n\nAre Benn and Tyler Seguin worth a combined cap hit of more than $19 million? Not in 2024. Both, though, have found a way to contribute, and Dallas' outlook would be a whole lot uglier if they were dragging the overall operation.\n\nThey're not Dallas' best skaters -- that honor belongs to Heiskanen, Johnston and the top line. They're certainly not cost-effective, either. Against Vegas, though, Benn was second on the Stars in all-situations scoring chances with 21 and brought plenty of physicality to the proceedings.

And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars.\n\n\"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\" DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot there to unpack.\"\n\nAfter losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nVegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve.\n\n\"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\"\n\nStone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this room thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\" Pietrangelo said.\n\n\"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I'm sure Dallas wasn't thrilled to play us in the first round either,\" Stone said. \"It's disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We'll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\n\nDeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.\n\nThe coach has been part of all four of the Game 7s for the Knights, who are 2-2 in those games. DeBoer was their coach for the wins in 2020 and 2021, and on San Jose's bench when the Sharks beat them in 2019.\n\n\"They wanted to go back-to-back, and I think they felt they had a team to do it,\" DeBoer said. \"There was a lot on the line for us too, I think just because of the season we had. ... All the work that we've put in this year, and how well we've played over the course of the season to earn the No. 1 seed, to get that draw and get ousted would have been hard to swallow.\"\n\nInstead, DeBoer got to celebrate with a few beers and look ahead to another series.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "source": {"uri": "fox16.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KLRT - FOX16.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox16.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carrier_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Carrier (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appendectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.fox16.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2024/05/6638de44927fe1.27649914.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 2424, "textEnd": 2431}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThroughout the Stanley Cup playoffs we'll be keeping track of all the action around the league, and bringing you all of the results in one place.\n\nNew York Rangers vs. Carolina Hurricanes\n\nRound 2 began on Sunday, with one game coming in on the schedule before Round 1 had even completely wrapped up (more on that later). This new matchup came between the Rangers and the Hurricanes, and it certainly got off to an interesting start.\n\nIt began with the Rangers, the more rested of these two teams, getting off to a hot start and jumping out to an early lead, as Mika Zinanejad scored inside the first three minutes of play, and we were off. The Hurricanes struck back quickly, though, tying the game up just a minute later, care of a goal by Jaccob Slavin on a slap shot from the point that found its way through traffic and in. But through the rest of the period, the Rangers really started to take over -- they seemed to get the better of the chances on the whole, and two power play goals (Zinanejad again, then Vincent Trocheck) allowed them to run away with the lead, heading into the first intermission.\n\nThe Hurricanes didn't go away quietly in this one, and early in the third period, Martin Necas scored to bring them back within one goal of the Rangers. Artemi Panarin restored that two-goal lead for the Rangers just before the halfway point of the period, but it still wasn't over for the Hurricanes. Seth Jarvis scored with under two minutes to go, with the goalie pulled, and there looked like the Hurricanes might have a late-game surge in them to force overtime, but ultimately, they fell just short. And the Rangers took Game 1 at home.\n\nAnd after all of that, we still had to see the first round wrapped up. Back in Dallas, we saw what felt like, in some ways, a fitting conclusion to a series that really tightened up as we went, with another close game to wrap it up.\n\nIt began with the scoring opening up on a goal by Wyatt Johnson -- his fourth of the playoffs already, he's been everywhere for the Stars -- late in the first period, giving the Stars their first lead of the game. Despite that early breakthrough on the scoring front, though, this game still felt pretty even. The Golden Knights were matching the Stars well in terms of chances created, in terms of pace, and when they finally tied things up late in the second period (their goal from Brett Howden), it felt like it was a long time coming.\n\nSo the series, it would seem, was coming down not just to one game, but to one period. And the Stars wasted no time pulling back into the lead in that final period, as they jumped ahead again on a nifty little goal on a backhand shot by Radek Faksa just 44 seconds into the frame. And the Golden Knights pushed back from here, but the Stars didn't make it easy on them -- indeed, when they could have just parked the bus for the final period and played only defense, instead they let their offense keep rolling, and actually ended up out-chancing the Golden Knights through those final 19 minutes and change. In the end, the Golden Knights couldn't get any of their chances past Jake Oettinger, and that Faksa goal held as the game-winner, and the Stars, after some real drama to start the series, secured their place in the second round.", "source": {"uri": "broadstreethockey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Broad Street Hockey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madeline_campbell@broadstreethockey.com", "name": "Madeline Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Tanev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Tanev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marchessault", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Marchessault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_seven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game seven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jarvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Jarvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ne\u010das", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Ne\u010das"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Trocheck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Trocheck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemi_Panarin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artemi Panarin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccob_Slavin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaccob Slavin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Howden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Howden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.broadstreethockey.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/USATSI_23200576_168402730_lowres-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Your roster is only 23, so nine players,\" Bruce Cassidy said, via Ryan S. Clark of ESPN. \"Two of them internal surgeries. You never know how those are going to play out. Some other ones were a little more defined. But I give our guys a lot of credit.\"\n\nThe Golden Knights took a 2-0 lead in this series with two road wins over the Stars, then lost three straight, before forcing a Game 7 with a win in Game 6. It was a hard-fought series between two teams who believed they had legitimate chances at a Stanley Cup.\n\nAfter winning the Stanley Cup last year, the Golden Knights brought back 20 players this year, but faced questions heading into the playoffs, mainly surrounding how everyone would perform when healthy. One of those players was Mark Stone, who went on LTIR, providing Vegas the chance to add players at the deadline with his cap hit not accounted for.\n\nThe Golden Knights took advantage of hat, adding players like Tomas Hertl, Anthony Mantha and Noah Hanifin ahead of the NHL Trade Deadline. Vegas was all in to repeat, but fell short against one of the cup favorites.\n\nAs far as the injuries go, key players like Shea theodore, Mark Stone, among others like Adin Hill missed significant time.

I think most of us do. As a hockey player, this is the most fun time that you're ever going to have playing hockey. You want to be competing for the Stanley Cup, so when you do lose and you're eliminated, it's hard. It kind of crushes your soul for a couple days.\"\n\nStone's emotions were visible as he discussed the game, and the series that slipped through Vegas' fingers after winning the first two games on the road. He was proud of his teammates for the season overall, and the way they fought on Sunday. With a matchup of Western Conference juggernauts in the first round, the difference between moving on to the second round and flying home for the summer came down to only a play or two.\n\n\"It's disappointing,\" he said. \"That's really the only way to say it ... Once you get up 2-0, I guess if we regret one thing we would've liked to have gotten a game at home there. But, at the end of the day, we gave ourselves a chance to win in Game 7 against a very good hockey team, and we didn't get it done.\"\n\nVegas played the top-seeded Stars well. A goalie was pulled for an extra attacker late in all seven games, speaking to how tightly contested the series was. In the end, both teams scored 16 goals, but on Sunday night the Stars got one more from fourth-line forward Radek Faksa, and that was the difference.\n\nThe Golden Knights never found their top gear in this postseason. Many of their top offensive players were held off the score sheet, and others contributed at times but didn't look themselves for long stretches.\n\nDoes that make this early exit more disappointing, or is it encouraging that they took one of the best teams in the NHL to the brink without their best stuff?\n\n\"I think we had spurts throughout the series, but I don't think we really got to that level that we wanted to,\" said defenseman Alex Pietrangelo, who had only a lone assist in the series.\n\nFor the third straight year, the Golden Knights were decimated by injuries during the regular season. They had nine different players undergo surgery, including key players that only just returned for the playoffs. Stone suffered a lacerated spleen. Tomas Hertl returned from a knee surgery that forced him out of the majority of the season. Pietrangelo had his appendix removed just days before the playoffs.\n\nFor long stretches of the series, the Golden Knights looked like a group of players that were exhausted from several deep playoff runs, coming off injuries and still searching for chemistry at the wrong time of year.\n\n\"I give our guys a lot of credit,\" coach Bruce Cassidy said. \"They played through a lot of injuries and tried to find chemistry with guys in and out (of the lineup). I think it took its toll eventually. Some of those surgeries you're obviously correcting a problem, but it takes a while to get back up to speed, and I think that would be the unfortunate part.\"\n\nVegas is a deep, talented team, but so is Dallas. The Stars never dominated, but they carried play more often than the Golden Knights, and one of the biggest reasons is likely that they were more in sync from months of playing together. Meanwhile Cassidy was piecing lines together of players that had never stepped on the ice together, hoping to find a combination that worked.\n\n\"It defines your game,\" Cassidy said. \"If we could've built it a little better in March and April then maybe it's a little smoother in the playoff round, but that's the hand you're dealt. That's on me to find the chemistry, quickly. At times it looked good. At times we needed to generate more. I'm very proud of the group.\"\n\nStone and Hertl both contributed big goals on the power play in this series. With play slowed down and space to operate, they showed the high-end offensive skill they possess, but at even strength neither looked themselves. With Stone on the ice at five-on-five Vegas was outscored 4-0. With Hertl it was 5-0.\n\n\"It's tough,\" Stone said. \"There were four or five guys coming in trying to get chemistry, and it's a little tougher. I think there are a lot of us that would've liked to produce a little more, but it's a tight series.\n\n\"I was healthy enough to play, so I don't make any excuses. I felt OK. I did the exact same thing last year, and it's not the easiest thing in the world, but at the end of the day if you're going to go out there, you have to produce and help your team win games.\"\n\nWilliam Karlsson was also playing through a lower-body injury that kept him off the ice for most of the postseason outside of games. He was limited on faceoffs due to the injury, and Cassidy said they gave him as many minutes as he could handle, but he also clearly wasn't himself.\n\nOutside of the injuries themselves, the rash of players missing from the lineup ultimately impacted Vegas' overall game. Teams are constantly preaching they must find their game by the time the playoffs roll around, and the Golden Knights never did. Their regular season inconsistencies also led to a much tougher first-round matchup than usual.\n\n\"We probably would've been better served putting ourselves in a better position in the regular season,\" Stone said. \"It's never easy coming in as an eight seed trying to beat all of the top teams at the start. If you look at last year we got that top seed, and we were able to win in five (games), then win in six (games).\"\n\nIf the Golden Knights escaped the first round, they may have found their stride, but they didn't have the luxury of time. They ran straight into a deep Stars team with veteran experience and young offensive stars. It's not as if the Golden Knights bowed out of the postseason with a whimper. Even with all they went through, they gave one of the NHL's best all they could handle, and came up just one goal short.\n\nThe question is, where do they go from here? It's one thing to write many of the problems off due to injuries, but that's something that has regularly plagued this roster. Vegas led the NHL in total cap hit lost due to injuries this season, and has finished in the top five of that stat for three straight seasons. One of the team's biggest strengths is its wealth of experience, but it's also an aging roster and that isn't changing.\n\nStone has missed significant time for three consecutive years and turns 32 later this month. Hertl should be better after a full summer to recover, but as is the case with any injury, it's not a given. Many of Vegas' most important players are over 30, including Pietrangelo, 34, who shoulders a heavy load on the blue line.\n\nIt's a fair question to ask if the Golden Knights can make it through the grind of an 82-game regular season with enough players intact to hit the ground running when the postseason arrives. Last season they were remarkably healthy for the entire Cup run, so they proved it's possible.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that we're going to be right back here in 12 months getting ready to go,\" Stone said. \"Obviously we're going to take some time off to reflect on it, but the work starts. We have a dedicated group of guys. Last year was the most fun all of us have ever had playing the game of hockey. We want to get back there.\"\n\nThe reality is next year's team will look very different. After last summer's Cup run Vegas brought mostly the same roster back, but now faces an offseason with six players set to hit unrestricted free agency.\n\nMost notably, the team's leading scorer Jonathan Marchessault is without a contract. Not only was he the most consistent offensive producer, who played in all 82 games, but his feisty, exuberant personality is woven into the fabric of the organization. Losing him would hurt in more than one way, and he's not the only player in need of a contract.\n\nChandler Stephenson, William Carrier, Michael Amadio, Anthony Mantha and Alec Martinez are all pending UFAs. Vegas already has roughly $81.8 million in salary committed to next year's roster -- not including Robin Lehner's $5 million cap hit, which has been on long-term injured reserve for two years.\n\nThat leaves very little room to add, so some key players from this roster will not be returning. Whether it's from the list of UFAs above, or players traded to clear space to sign them, is still to be determined. There are tough choices to be made.\n\n\"We're probably not going to be able to bring everybody back,\" Stone said. \"That's just the nature of hockey. It kind of brings tears to your eyes when you realize that you're not going to be with the same group of guys, because you build these bonds and friendships then you have to see teammates and friends go. Man, I really thought we could've done some damage going forward.\"\n\nThe Golden Knights are still an excellent hockey team. They showed that this postseason, even in defeat. They came up only one goal short against an elite team, even when not at their best. Still, there are some questions about what their best will look like moving forward, another year deeper into this championship window.\n\nWe will look back on this hard-fought series as either a blip on the radar, where Vegas was edged by a good team while not at its best, or the beginning of the decline for a talented but aging roster.\n\nStone and his teammates are confident, and they have plenty of reasons to be.\n\n\"I guess for our organization it's fuel for the fire,\" Stone said. \"We'll be ready for September to be ready to be right back here next season ... We've always been good at having a chip on our shoulder, so we have to use this as another chip.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_granger@theathletic.com", "name": "Jesse Granger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Hertl", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_attacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra attacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radek_Faksa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radek Faksa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Karlsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Karlsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appendectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carrier_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Carrier (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Marchessault", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Marchessault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Lehner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin Lehner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Martinez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mantha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mantha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Amadio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Amadio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/06011800/GettyImages-2151128575-e1714972700411.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Your roster is only 23, so nine players,\" Cassidy explained. \"Two of them internal surgeries. You never know how those are going to play out. Some other ones were a little more defined, but I give our guys a lot of credit.\"\n\nEven though the Golden Knights had 20 players returning from their title team, they still faced questions heading into the playoffs. Most of those queries were about what would a fully healthy Golden Knights look like once the postseason started. That also included questions about how trade deadline acquisitions such as forwards Tomas Hertl and Anthony Mantha along with defenseman Noah Hanifin would fit into an established team.\n\nThe Golden Knights opened the series by winning both games at the American Airlines Center in Dallas to take a 2-0 series lead before the Stars won three straight games. Vegas rallied with a 2-0 win in Game 6 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas to force a Game 7.\n\n\"Up 2-0, it would've been nice to find a way to win two of those three games,\" Golden Knights defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \"They made some adjustments that I don't think we adjusted well enough right way. That's on us as players to find a way when we're up 2-0 to get the job done.\"\n\nNHL Injury Viz, a site that tracks games lost to injuries, has data revealing how the Golden Knights were among the teams to lose the most player games to injury during the 2023-24 season.\n\nIn total, the Golden Knights had 10 players who missed more than 10 games because of various injuries. Some players such as defenseman Shea Theodore (35 games) and left winger Mark Stone (26) had extended absences. Other such as goaltender Adin Hill also missed more than 10 games but were out with separate injuries. Hill missed seven games this season with a lower-body injury and another 15 games with an undisclosed injury, according to NHL Injury Viz's data.\n\nCassidy added how those injuries also came at a time in which the Golden Knights were trying to find cohesion with their forward lines and defense pairings.\n\nHertl, who was traded on March 8, was an example of the Golden Knights' challenges. He was still a member of the San Jose Sharks when his last regular season game came Jan. 27 before he played in the NHL All-Star Game on Feb. 3. Nine days later, the Sharks announced Hertl would undergo a knee procedure that would not see him return until April 8. He played just six games with his new club before the playoffs.\n\nIn total, Hertl missed what amounted to 28 regular-season games between the Golden Knights and the Sharks.\n\n\"Some of those surgeries are obviously correcting a problem, but it takes as a while to get back up to speed,\" Cassidy said. \"That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\n\n\"I didn't do a good enough job of that but that's a lot of surgeries in one year for guys to overcome, and it defines your game.\"\n\nStone, who underwent multiple back surgeries last season, was recovering from a lacerated spleen this season before returning ahead of Game 1. The Golden Knights captain said he was proud of how the team performed in the face of what was a challenging set of circumstances.\n\n\"We had a hard time staying healthy,\" Stone said. \"Still found a way to get into the playoffs, and we did give ourselves a chance to win the series with a one-goal loss in Game 7 against the top team in the conference. It's disappointing. That's really the only way to say it. It's disappointing.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Hertl", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Hertl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mantha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mantha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Theodore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shea Theodore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Hanifin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Hanifin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adin_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adin Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NHL All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0506%2Fr1329141_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-08", "textStart": 2425, "textEnd": 2432}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-27", "textStart": 2568, "textEnd": 2575}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-03", "textStart": 2621, "textEnd": 2627}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-08", "textStart": 2740, "textEnd": 2747}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

And there was just the tremendous joy of getting past them in his second postseason chance with the Stars.\n\n\"Obviously, really wanted to win this series. I mean, we wanted our turn,\" DeBoer said after the series-ending 2-1 victory Sunday night. \"We felt we did all the right things all year in order to get the first seed. And then you draw a team like Vegas, which I honestly think they've got a deeper team than they had last year. And to plow through the adversity of being down 2-0, there's a lot there to unpack.\"\n\nAfter losing those first two games at home, the Stars came back to win a tight series. Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nVegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve.\n\n\"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\"\n\nStone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this room thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\" Pietrangelo said.\n\n\"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I'm sure Dallas wasn't thrilled to play us in the first round either,\" Stone said. \"It's disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We'll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\n\nDeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.\n\nThe coach has been part of all four of the Game 7s for the Knights, who are 2-2 in those games. DeBoer was their coach for the wins in 2020 and 2021, and on San Jose's bench when the Sharks beat them in 2019.\n\n\"They wanted to go back-to-back, and I think they felt they had a team to do it,\" DeBoer said. \"There was a lot on the line for us too, I think just because of the season we had. ... All the work that we've put in this year, and how well we've played over the course of the season to earn the No. 1 seed, to get that draw and get ousted would have been hard to swallow.\"\n\nInstead, DeBoer got to celebrate with a few beers and look ahead to another series.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "source": {"uri":

The Stars' season was saved by a rather unexpected member of its roster: fourth-line left-winger Radek Faksa.\n\nThe 30-year-old from the Czech Republic had missed the previous four games due to an injury, but saved the most important contribution of the series - and the best goal of his career - for Game 7.\n\nJust 44 seconds into the final frame, Faksa and his line mates got the cycle going in the Vegas zone, and he lifted a backhand shot past Adin Hill to send the American Airlines Center into a frenzy.\n\nThat would end up being the game winner, and Dallas eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champions with a 2-1 victory. The Colorado Avalanche await them in the second round.\n\nBut Faksa's goal wasn't just significant for the Stars. While simultaneously clinching a series win for his team, he delivered on a promise to his 2 \u00bd year-old son, Elliot.\n\nBefore the game, father and son were skating on the ice playing some hockey, when the younger Faksa made his dad promise him he'd score a goal. While Elliot wasn't there to see it (he had to be taken home to go to bed before the third period started), his dad made sure he delivered on his word.\n\n\"I'm happy I did,\" Faksa said. \"And so I can show him the video in the morning, and we can watch it together.\"\n\nI'm sure the little man loved watching that video this morning.

The fifth-seeded Mavericks beat the Clippers for the the first time in three first-round tries over the past five seasons and will open the Western Conference semifinals at the top-seed, Oklahoma City, on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Stars, the No. 1 seed in the West, beat the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights 2-1 in Game 7 on Sunday night to wrap up the first-round series. The Stars now move on to play the Colorado Avalanche in the second round. Game 1 is in Dallas, also on Tuesday night.\n\nBut for two franchises that have had plenty of postseason appearances as well as rebuilding periods, when was the last time both teams made it past the first round during the same year? And what was going on during that time period?\n\nDuring the 2002-2003 season, the Dallas Mavericks finished the regular season 60-22, second in the Midwest Division and third in the Western Conference. That offseason, the team signed free agents Walt Williams and Raja Bell while Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash were both selected as All-Stars for the Western Conference.\n\nNowitzki finished seventh in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting while bench sparkplug Nick Van Exel finished fourth in the Sixth Man of the Year voting.\n\nThe Mavs were matched up with the No. 6 seed Portland Trail Blazers in the first round that season. Dallas was able to win the first three games of that series before the Blazers rallied back and won the following three games, sending the series to a decisive Game 7. At the time, Portland became just the third team to force a Game 7 after being down 0-3.\n\nBehind 31 points, 11 rebounds and 3 blocks from Nowitzki, the Mavs beat the Blazers 107-95 to win the series 4-3.\n\nIn the conference semifinals, the Mavs faced off against the No. 2 seed Sacramento Kings. Dallas lost to Sacramento in the conference semifinals series 4-1 the previous postseason.\n\nThe Kings won Game 1 at home 124-113 while the Mavs took Game 2 (132-110) and Game 3 (141-137 2OT). This series would inevitably go to a Game 7, just like the first round, as the Mavs pulled off another Game 7 victory by beating the Kings 112-99 behind 30 points and 19 rebounds from Nowitzki.\n\nBy beating the Kings, the Mavs moved on to the conference finals for the first time since 1988. However, that would be as far as the Mavs went as the No. 1 seed San Antonio Spurs won the series 4-2 with Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili leading the way. The Spurs would also go on to win the NBA Championship that season.\n\nThe Mavs would not return to the conference finals until 2006.\n\nIn the 2002-2003 season, the Dallas Stars finished the regular season 46-17-15-4 with 245 goals for and 169 goals against. They were first in the Pacific Division and the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. Dallas also finished the regular season with the most shutouts in the NHL (11) with Marty Turco as the team's goaltender.\n\nDuring the offseason, the Stars named Dave Tippett as the team's new head coach. The team had three All-Stars that season: Mike Modano, Bill Guerin and Turco.\n\nThe Stars were matched up with the No. 8 seed Edmonton Oilers in the first round that season. This was the sixth time in the last seven years, at the time, that these two franchises were matched up in the playoffs.\n\nAfter losing two of the first three games, Dallas won Game 4, Game 5 and Game 6, behind three goals from Sergei Zubov and Turco only giving up five goals in those final three games.\n\nIn the conference semifinals, the Stars faced off against the No. 7 seed Anaheim Ducks. This was the first time these two teams had played each other in the postseason.\n\nThe series started off with one of the Stars' longest playoff games in franchise history with Game 1 taking five overtimes to decide the winner. After four scoreless overtime periods, Ducks Right Wing Petr Sykora scored just 48 seconds into the fifth overtime to hand the Stars a gut-wrenching 4-3 loss.\n\nAfter getting down 3-1 in the series, Dallas rallied in Game 5 and won 4-1 behind two goals from second-year center Niko Kapanen. However, that would end up being the final victory of the postseason for the Stars as the Ducks would win the series-closing Game 6 4-3 thanks to a goal from Ducks defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh with 1:06 left in the third period.\n\nThe Stars would not return to the conference semifinals until 2008.\n\nWhile there were plenty of high-level sports games happening in Dallas during this time period, here is a look back at some other notable things happening the last time the Mavs and Stars were both in the second round of the NBA and NHL playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news",

For now, Vegas and its players are trying to process their loss to the Stars. Stone was one of the Golden Knights players who faced the media after Game 7. He mentioned that he is confident in making it back to the Stanley Cup Playoffs next year. But in the moment, this loss certainly hurts.\n\n\"They say (winning) is addictive, and it is. I live for this s**t. Most of these guys do... so when you lose it crushes your soul for a few days,\" Mark Stone said, via The Athletic's Jesse Granger, after Vegas fell to the Stars in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nGolden Knights weren't 100%\n\nHeading into the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Golden Knights weren't 100% healthy. They had been without Mark Stone since the NHL Trade Deadline. And they had many other players who missed games due to injury. In fact, head coach Bruce Cassidy said Sunday that nine different players had surgery during the season.\n\nTheir brutal injury luck continued into the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Forward William Karlsson was clearly playing hurt in Game 7 against the Stars. Cassidy confirmed he was dealing with a lower-body injury on Sunday night. The Golden Knights bench boss said Karlsson wasn't complaining before Game 7.\n\n\"Lower body injury. I'm not going to get into specifics, but he was not 100%. I could say that. You could see that. We tried to get Karly as much ice time as he could handle. He's never going to complain,\" the Golden Knights bench boss said, via Granger.\n\nVegas has difficult roster decisions ahead\n\nMark Stone is likely to return to Vegas next season. However, a number of key members of the team may not say the same. The Golden Knights are projected to have less than $1 million in cap space for the 2024-25 season after contracts come off the books. And it may lead to a Vegas original moving on.\n\nJonathan Marchessault has played in Vegas since the team's first season in 2017-18. He is the franchise's all-time leader in points with 417. He is also the leader in playoff points with 75. Last season, Marchessault earned the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the Stanley Cup Playoffs when the Golden Knights won it all.\n\nWith limited cap space, though, the veteran winger may not be long for the Sin City. Other potential exits include forwards Chandler Stephenson, William Carrier, and Michael Amadio. Defenseman Alec Martinez is another name that could have played his final game with the Golden Knights on Sunday.\n\nVegas can certainly keep Marchessault, but it'd likely take a trade to do so. William Karlsson and Ivan Barbashev are two names that could be moved to clear cap space.

Both teams scored 16 goals, and the margin was never more than two goals at any point.\n\n\"I don't think either team could sit here and say they were dominating the series, or were truly at their best the whole time,\" said Bruce Cassidy, who two years ago replaced DeBoer as the Vegas coach. \"I don't think you saw either team truly get to its max. But some of that credit has to go to the opposition.\"\n\nThe Stars now have a quick turnaround, though they get to stay home. Game 1 of their second-round series against Colorado is Tuesday night, a week after the Avalanche wrapped up their opening round with a Game 5 win over Winnipeg.\n\nVegas, which had 22 players back from its Cup-winning roster, goes into an offseason wondering what could have been without all of the injuries during the season. While the group was together at the end, captain Mark Stone didn't even play until the postseason with three trade-deadline acquisitions that may not have able to get if he hadn't been on the long-term injured reserve.\n\n\"We came out of the gate really well, our full team was together and then the adversity kind of kicked in. We had nine guys have surgery this year. Nine guys ... two of them internal surgeries,\" Cassidy said. \"It takes a while to get back up to speed. That would be the unfortunate part. They came and did get healthy enough for the playoffs. That was the positive, and now you are trying to get a team up to speed in a hurry.\"\n\nStone lacerated his spleen Feb. 20 and didn't return to full-contact practice until two days before the series opener. Alex Pietrangelo had a non-COVID illness in late March, then had an appendectomy. Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier also missed games late in the season.\n\n\"I don't think anyone in this room thought we weren't going to have an opportunity to win,\" Pietrangelo said.\n\n\"I really thought we could have done some damage going forward. I'm sure Dallas wasn't thrilled to play us in the first round either,\" Stone said. \"It's disappointing, but I guess for our organization, fuel the fire. We'll be ready for September to be right back here next season.\"\n\nDeBoer is 8-0 in Game 7s in his career with four teams, including a second-round series with Dallas against Seattle last year before facing the Knights.\n\nThe coach has been part of all four of the Game 7s for the Knights, who are 2-2 in those games. DeBoer was their coach for the wins in 2020 and 2021, and on San Jose's bench when the Sharks beat them in 2019.\n\n\"They wanted to go back-to-back, and I think they felt they had a team to do it,\" DeBoer said. \"There was a lot on the line for us too, I think just because of the season we had. ... All the work that we've put in this year, and how well we've played over the course of the season to earn the No. 1 seed, to get that draw and get ousted would have been hard to swallow.\"\n\nInstead, DeBoer got to celebrate with a few beers and look ahead to another series.", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Cassidy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Cassidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Stone_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Stone (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pietrangelo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pietrangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carrier_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Carrier (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose_Sharks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Jose Sharks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendectomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appendectomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/2024050613050/6638d4f5023d1607a079da39jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541611", "eventUri": "eng-9541611", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-20", "textStart": 1560, "textEnd": 1567}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The Golden Knights are out. There will be no parade.\n\nElimination came at the hands of the Dallas Stars, who beat the Knights 2-1 in Game 7 of their first-round series Sunday at American Airlines Center.\n\nA team in Dallas that deserved to win. It was the better team most of the series. It earned the right to advance.\n\nIt means the Knights get ready for exit interviews and clean-out day and vacation plans. It also means this: The team next season could have a decidedly different look given several free agents on the roster.\n\nAmong them is one of the most popular players in franchise history in forward Jonathan Marchessault. You can't overstate the importance of Marchessault to the Knights these past seven years, an Original Misfit who became a fan favorite almost overnight.\n\nFabric of team\n\nBut the Knights have hardly been afraid of moving on from such beloved names (see Fleury, Marc-Andre), and it's uncertain if they would again.\n\nFrom a player who scored 42 goals this season and won the Conn Smythe Trophy during last season's playoffs.\n\nHe's 33 and has completed a six-year, $30 million deal. He's also among five players remaining from an original expansion roster in 2017-18.\n\nThis was Marchessault earlier this season: \"Obviously, it's on my mind. I have a wife and four kids. I love it here, love the organization. I think I've been very good for it, too. It's just about seeing eye to eye on things. I know it's a business. I know we're not married to each other. But you know what you're going to get from me every year. I have a lot of hockey in front of me.\"\n\nMaybe the organization values him in a way a contract will be struck. Maybe it happens soon. Coach Bruce Cassidy has called Marchessault the fabric of the team. Strong words. But nothing is certain in the business of professional sports except this: Things hardly remain the same year to year.\n\nIt goes to reason some of those free agents -- which include the likes of Chandler Stephenson and William Carrier and Alec Martinez -- have played their final game with the Knights.\n\n\"Probably not going to be able to bring everybody back,\" captain Mark Stone said. \"It's just the nature of hockey. Kind of brings tears to your eyes when you realize you're not going to be with the same group of guys.\n\n\"You build these bonds and friendships, and you have to see friends and teammates go.\"\n\nIt was a deeper roster than last season's championship team. It just didn't play as well in the biggest of moments. The overall score of the series was 16-16. It was that close.\n\nBut when it mattered most Sunday, Dallas made the plays that equaled victory.\n\nThink about it: Marchessault hit a post in the first period, and the Stars came right back down and scored for a 1-0 lead. The Knights then missed an open net at the end of the second, and Dallas went up 2-1 on its first shift of the third. The margin was razor thin since the puck dropped in Game 1.\n\nYou need to find a way when up 2-0 in a best-of-seven and both were road wins. You need to discover something that allows you not to then lose consecutive home games. That's all on the Knights.\n\nYes. They faced adversity again this season with injuries -- nine players had surgeries -- but had everyone except defenseman Nic Hague available for all seven games. Some guys weren't 100 percent. That's every team this time of year.\n\nThey're not moving on because the other team was better.\n\nThe future\n\nAnd now, as it is when any season concludes, it's about looking to the future.\n\n\"We have a lot of good people in this room,\" defenseman Alex Pietrangelo said. \"The longer you play, the more you appreciate the people. You obviously like playing the game, but it's the people who make it fun coming to work every day. It's an unfortunate part of the business.

Ron DeSantis and his top aides of forcing him to retire after he refused to carry out orders he says were illegal or inappropriate, according to a lawsuit filed overnight.\n\nShane Desguin, a career employee of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, rose to become the agency's chief of staff. He alleges his retirement in November was actually a \"wrongful termination\" and was the result of him blowing the whistle on a host of issues, including violations of state public records laws, illegal orders to arrest demonstrators without probable cause and directives to obtain photos and personal information of migrants flown to the Sunshine State without legal justification.\n\n\"Despite his stellar work performance during his employment,\" the lawsuit says, Desguin \"was subjected to disparate treatment, different terms and conditions of employment, and held to a different standard because he reported Defendants' malfeasance, gross misconduct and unlawful employment activities and was subject to retaliation thereafter.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in state Circuit Court in Tallahassee and names DeSantis and FDLE, long viewed as one of the nation's premier state-level law-enforcement agencies. Desguin is seeking unspecified damages and names both FDLE and DeSantis as defendants.\n\nA spokeswoman for FDLE said she did not have an immediate response to the lawsuit.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern declined to comment, saying the administration would address the allegations in court.\n\nSome of Desguin's accusations have filtered into public view in recent months in the wake of his retirement and the subsequent firing of his former deputy, Patricia Carpenter. They are currently at the center of a separate lawsuit filed by the Washington Post, seeking records related to DeSantis' travel while he was mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nPolitico reported earlier this month that both Desguin and Carpenter were investigated by FDLE and were found to have violated workplace rules. Prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges.\n\nBoth Desguin and Carpenter, according to the lawsuit, were subjected to an internal investigation built on bogus accusations, a \"thinly veiled attempt at character assassination,\" which occurred because they blew the whistle.\n\nWhile he declined to comment on the lawsuit, Redfern on Thursday pointed to the findings of that probe and a previous comment by FDLE's communications director, Gretl Plessinger: \"Shane Desguin and Patricia Carpenter created workplace chaos, endangered the safety of other employees, and acted dishonestly and unprofessionally.\"\n\nDesguin's attorney, Marie Mattox, said she had no comment beyond the complaint filed in court.\n\nDesguin's lawsuit says that when he was forced to retire last year, he received formal notification of his departure from the agency he joined in 2005 that said: \"Retired. Not involving misconduct.\"\n\nThe new lawsuit alleges that problems for Desguin began in late 2021, when Desguin was leading the agency's Office of Statewide Intelligence and had been given new responsibilities in dealing with the influx of migrants who were being flown to Florida by the federal government.\n\nDesguin alleges that DeSantis, through a senior official, ordered him to obtain \"photographs, biometric data, and any other pertinent information by engaging with migrants at the airport. As these requests escalated, (Desguin) objected, and emphasized, on multiple occasions...FDLE could not legally conduct name checks, capture photographs, or compile intelligence files without a criminal predicate or reasonable suspicion, as those actions would be unlawful.\"\n\nThe issue did not end there and, Desguin alleges, he continued voicing his concerns. When officials suggested transporting migrants out of Florida by bus, he told his superiors such a move could amount to \"false imprisonment or kidnapping,\" according to the complaint.\n\nIn September 2023, Desguin alleges a senior aide to DeSantis said the governor wanted him to make arrests at a demonstration of \"neo-Nazis\" in Orlando because it would have political benefit. Desguin allegedly pushed back, saying officers couldn't arrest anyone simply for expressing their views.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Desguin was told, \"I don't think you understand. If you look hard enough, you can find a way. The Governor [DeSantis] wants someone arrested today. He [Defendant DeSantis] will stand by you in any arrest.\"\n\nUltimately, arrests were made, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe end of Desguin's career at FDLE, according to the lawsuit, came after weeks of internal discussions over the hot-button issue of releasing the agency's records related to the governor's travel as he tried to wrest the GOP nomination from former President Donald Trump. After having played a role in revising Florida's public records law, Desguin alleges it was clear to him that DeSantis' refusal to release the records violated the statute and its intent.\n\nAt the same time, an agency lawyer who was in line for promotion to oversee all agency records requests agreed with Desguin's assessment and threatened to quit over the issue, according to the complaint.\n\nThe governor and his team, according to the lawsuit, directed FDLE to withhold the records and refused to allow the attorney who disagreed with them to be promoted. They also allegedly inquired whether the lawyer was a member of conservative legal organization The Federalist Society, implying that would help move the promotion along.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Desguin went ahead and authorized a raise for the attorney despite the governor's orders. That infuriated the governor's office and Desguin was ordered to rescind the salary change. Then, he alleges, he and Carpenter were suspended.\n\nHe allegedly was forced to retire or he would be fired.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federalist Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_suspicion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reasonable suspicion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biometrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/fbd71b3d-968c-4c7f-8a18-f9f2cbc290ee/desantis-ss-jt-240619_1718823643286_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668847", "eventUri": "eng-9668847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 248, "relevance": 1}

Ron DeSantis and his top aides of forcing him to retire after he refused to carry out orders he says were illegal or inappropriate, according to a lawsuit filed overnight.\n\nShane Desguin, a career employee of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, rose to become the agency's chief of staff. He alleges his retirement in November was actually a \"wrongful termination\" and was the result of him blowing the whistle on a host of issues, including violations of state public records laws, illegal orders to arrest demonstrators without probable cause and directives to obtain photos and personal information of migrants flown to the Sunshine State without legal justification.\n\n\"Despite his stellar work performance during his employment,\" the lawsuit says, Desguin \"was subjected to disparate treatment, different terms and conditions of employment, and held to a different standard because he reported Defendants' malfeasance, gross misconduct and unlawful employment activities and was subject to retaliation thereafter.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in state Circuit Court in Tallahassee and names DeSantis and FDLE, long viewed as one of the nation's premier state-level law-enforcement agencies. Desguin is seeking unspecified damages and names both FDLE and DeSantis as defendants.\n\nA spokeswoman for FDLE said she did not have an immediate response to the lawsuit.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern declined to comment, saying the administration would address the allegations in court.\n\nSome of Desguin's accusations have filtered into public view in recent months in the wake of his retirement and the subsequent firing of his former deputy, Patricia Carpenter. They are currently at the center of a separate lawsuit filed by the Washington Post, seeking records related to DeSantis' travel while he was mounting an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nPolitico reported earlier this month that both Desguin and Carpenter were investigated by FDLE and were found to have violated workplace rules. Prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges.\n\nBoth Desguin and Carpenter, according to the lawsuit, were subjected to an internal investigation built on bogus accusations, a \"thinly veiled attempt at character assassination,\" which occurred because they blew the whistle.\n\nWhile he declined to comment on the lawsuit, Redfern on Thursday pointed to the findings of that probe and a previous comment by FDLE's communications director, Gretl Plessinger: \"Shane Desguin and Patricia Carpenter created workplace chaos, endangered the safety of other employees, and acted dishonestly and unprofessionally.\"\n\nDesguin's attorney, Marie Mattox, said she had no comment beyond the complaint filed in court.\n\nDesguin's lawsuit says that when he was forced to retire last year, he received formal notification of his departure from the agency he joined in 2005 that said: \"Retired. Not involving misconduct.\"\n\nThe new lawsuit alleges that problems for Desguin began in late 2021, when Desguin was leading the agency's Office of Statewide Intelligence and had been given new responsibilities in dealing with the influx of migrants who were being flown to Florida by the federal government.\n\nDesguin alleges that DeSantis, through a senior official, ordered him to obtain \"photographs, biometric data, and any other pertinent information by engaging with migrants at the airport. As these requests escalated, (Desguin) objected, and emphasized, on multiple occasions...FDLE could not legally conduct name checks, capture photographs, or compile intelligence files without a criminal predicate or reasonable suspicion, as those actions would be unlawful.\"\n\nThe issue did not end there and, Desguin alleges, he continued voicing his concerns. When officials suggested transporting migrants out of Florida by bus, he told his superiors such a move could amount to \"false imprisonment or kidnapping,\" according to the complaint.\n\nIn September 2023, Desguin alleges a senior aide to DeSantis said the governor wanted him to make arrests at a demonstration of \"neo-Nazis\" in Orlando because it would have political benefit. Desguin allegedly pushed back, saying officers couldn't arrest anyone simply for expressing their views.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Desguin was told, \"I don't think you understand. If you look hard enough, you can find a way. The Governor [DeSantis] wants someone arrested today. He [Defendant DeSantis] will stand by you in any arrest.\"\n\nUltimately, arrests were made, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe end of Desguin's career at FDLE, according to the lawsuit, came after weeks of internal discussions over the hot-button issue of releasing the agency's records related to the governor's travel as he tried to wrest the GOP nomination from former President Donald Trump. After having played a role in revising Florida's public records law, Desguin alleges it was clear to him that DeSantis' refusal to release the records violated the statute and its intent.\n\nAt the same time, an agency lawyer who was in line for promotion to oversee all agency records requests agreed with Desguin's assessment and threatened to quit over the issue, according to the complaint.\n\nThe governor and his team, according to the lawsuit, directed FDLE to withhold the records and refused to allow the attorney who disagreed with them to be promoted. They also allegedly inquired whether the lawyer was a member of conservative legal organization The Federalist Society, implying that would help move the promotion along.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Desguin went ahead and authorized a raise for the attorney despite the governor's orders. That infuriated the governor's office and Desguin was ordered to rescind the salary change. Then, he alleges, he and Carpenter were suspended.\n\nHe allegedly was forced to retire or he would be fired.\n\n\"It's too much\"\n\nThe Citizens Property Insurance Corporation's Board of Governors voted to approve a new rate package for 2025 and ABC Action News Reporter Casey Albritton spoke to homeowners to get your voice on the rate hike.\n\nFlorida residents react to potential Citizens Insurance rate hike\n\nTax credits being offered to Florida businesses to help offset child care costs\n\nHeather Leigh\n\n5:36 AM, Jun 20, 2024\n\nCitizens board approves 2025 rate hike, state regulators now need to sign off\n\nForrest Saunders\n\n10:37 PM, Jun 19, 2024\n\nNew poll suggests tight re-election race for US Rep.

Marie Mattox, attorney for Desguin and Carpenter, told Politico that \"this is a lie and never occurred.\"\n\nThe investigation found that Desguin and Carpenter violated state rules on insubordination, ethics and workplace conduct.

(WFLA) -- A former Florida Department of Law Enforcement chief was forced to retire after he refused to comply with \"unlawful\" orders from Gov. Ron DeSantis to arrest demonstrators without probable cause and illegally obtain photographs of migrants, according to a lawsuit filed on Thursday.\n\nShane Desguin filed the lawsuit against DeSantis and the FDLE, claiming that he was retaliated against for whistleblower activities. Desguin was with the department from 2005 until his \"wrongful termination\" on Nov. 17, 2023, according to the suit.\n\nDesguin claims he was forced to retire or be fired.\n\n\"His termination was imminent and no reasonable person would have remained employed with Defendant under these circumstances,\" the suit states.\n\nAn FDLE spokesperson said they have not yet received the lawsuit, but the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The governor's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nDesguin, along with DeSantis's public safety and immigration czar, Larry Keefe, were made aware of charter flights arriving in Jacksonville that they believed were transporting migrants into Florida, according to the lawsuit.\n\nKeefe, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, told Desguin that DeSantis wanted information about the migrants, including photographs, criminal records and their destinations.\n\nKeefe told the FDLE to \"procure photographs, biometric data, and any other pertinent information by engaging with migrants at the airport,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nDesguin told Keefe multiple times that FDLE couldn't conduct name checks, take photos or compile intelligence files without criminal predicate or reasonable suspicion, \"as those actions would be unlawful.\"\n\nKeefe became \"weary\" of Desguin's \"constant emphasis on reasonable suspicion and criminal predicate,\" telling him that there would be \"adverse consequences\" if he didn't comply, according to the lawsuit.\n\nDuring discussions about DeSantis's desire to transport migrants to other states, Desguin raised objections about potential false imprisonment or kidnapping, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIn September 2023, neo-Nazi demonstrators were in Orlando. At the time, DeSantis was running for president, and he wanted to see someone arrested, the lawsuit states.\n\nDesguin told DeSantis's Chief of Staff, Alex Kelly, that the FDLE could not just arrest a person who is expressing their First Amendment rights.\n\n\"I don't think you understand,\" Kelly replied, according to the lawsuit. \"If you look hard enough, you can find a way. The Governor wants someone arrested today. He will stand by you in any arrest.\"\n\nDesguin insisted that without probable cause, an arrest would be unconstitutional and illegal.\n\n\"Numerous objections were voiced by FDLE employees, including [Desguin], asserting that they could not simply arrest someone solely because [DeSantis] desired it,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nA month later, Desguin was involved in a meeting over public records surrounding DeSantis' travel records.\n\nDesguin and Janine Robinson, an FDLE attorney, believed that not releasing the travel records was a violation of public records law. Robinson's promotion, which was recommended by Desguin and had been authorized, was denied days later.\n\nThe Washington Post sued DeSantis over withholding the release of the travel records, claiming the law shielding the release of the records is unconstitutional. Desguin and another FDLE employee filed sworn statements in that lawsuit.\n\nDesguin had been the subject of an investigation surrounding workplace misconduct, which was completed in May.\n\n\"As evidenced by the findings of this investigation (which included testimonies of dozens of employees), Shane Desguin and Patricia Carpenter created workplace chaos, endangered the safety of other employees, and acted dishonestly and unprofessionally,\" the FDLE said in a statement to WFLA.com. \"This included sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and brandishing a firearm inside an office.\"\n\n\"We are glad that our association with these bad actors has ended,\" the statement read.\n\nHowever, the lawsuit notes that the investigation wasn't initiated until days after Desguin's retirement, which was classified as \"not involving misconduct.\"\n\n\"It is highly suspicious that this complaint was filed AFTER [Desguin's] termination on the heels of the [Patricia] Carpenter complaint and AFTER [Desguin] had been cleared of any wrongdoing when he was forced to retire,\" the lawsuit reads.\n\nThe findings of the report were given to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges.\n\n\"Defendants have done everything possible to try to ruin [Desguin] and Carpenter since their separations, presumably because DeSantis is embarrassed by the allegations, after [Desguin]

The lawsuit, filed overnight in state Circuit Court in Tallahassee, accuses DeSantis and his senior aides of wrongful termination and retaliation.\n\nShane Desguin, who served as the chief of staff for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), asserts that his November retirement was a \"wrongful termination.\" According to ABC News, Desguin alleges that he was dismissed for blowing the whistle on various issues, including violations of state public records laws and illegal orders to arrest demonstrators without probable cause.\n\nDespite a strong work performance, Desguin claims he faced discrimination and was held to different employment standards after reporting misconduct. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and names both DeSantis and FDLE as defendants.\n\nDeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern declined to comment on the lawsuit, stating that the administration would address the allegations in court. According to Politico, Desguin and his former deputy, Patricia Carpenter, were investigated by FDLE and found to have violated workplace rules, although prosecutors did not pursue criminal charges.\n\nDesguin's attorney, Marie Mattox, had no comment beyond the lawsuit filed in court. The complaint alleges that problems for Desguin began in late 2021, when he was tasked with managing the influx of migrants flown to Florida by the federal government. Desguin claims he was ordered to collect photographs and personal data of migrants without legal justification, actions he argued were unlawful.\n\nIn September 2023, Desguin alleges he was pressured to make arrests at a demonstration of neo-Nazis in Orlando for political gain. When he objected, stating that arrests could not be made solely for expressing views, he was allegedly told to find a way to make arrests because the governor wanted it done.\n\nDesguin's lawsuit also highlights his involvement in internal discussions over releasing records related to the governor's travel, a contentious issue as DeSantis sought the GOP presidential nomination. Desguin claims he was instructed to withhold these records, contrary to Florida's public records law.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate controversy is unfolding involving DeSantis' administration's interpretation of public records law. According to the Tampa Bay Times, lawyers for DeSantis argued in court that phone call records made on a private cellphone used for state business are not public records. This argument was presented during a hearing about records related to the 2022 migrant flights to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nThe Florida Center for Government Accountability sued DeSantis' administration to obtain records on the migrant flights. During the hearing, DeSantis' lawyer, Christopher Lunny, claimed that call logs from personal phones are not subject to public records law. Judge Lee Marsh expressed skepticism, noting that this interpretation could undermine transparency laws.\n\nDeSantis' chief of staff, James Uthmeier, used his personal phone for official business, a practice that has raised concerns about evading public scrutiny. Despite an order to produce these records, the administration has not complied, prompting ongoing legal battles.\n\nIf DeSantis' interpretation were to be upheld, it could set a precedent allowing government employees to use personal devices for official business without public accountability, potentially undermining Florida's public records law.

Ron DeSantis, including requests to delay the release of public records, photograph and transport migrants out of state and arrest neo-Nazi demonstrators in Orlando.\n\nShane Desguin, the former chief of staff for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, filed a whistleblower lawsuit in Leon County Circuit Court this week accusing the agency and DeSantis of wrongful termination and retaliation.\n\nDesguin says that despite his stellar work performance, he was targeted because he reported \"gross misconduct and unlawful activities\" of his boss and other officials in the DeSantis administration.\n\nThe lawsuit says Desquin faced \"disparate treatment and retaliation\" from FDLE Commissioner Mark Glass and others in agency and the DeSantis administration.\n\nDesguin said he was forced to step down from the FDLE last November after more than 30 years with the agency because of the concerns he raised about the agency delaying the release of public information requested by reporters. His deputy chief of staff Patricia Carpenter was fired when she sought whistleblower status for raising the same concerns.\n\nCarpenter will be filing a similar lawsuit, said their lawyer, Marie Mattox, a well-known employee rights attorney in Tallahassee.\n\nBoth were the subject of an internal investigation by FDLE that produced a 129-page report that the lawsuit calls a \"thinly veiled attempt at character assassination.\"\n\nDana Kelly, an FDLE spokeswoman, said Thursday in an email that the investigation's findings showed that Desguin and Carpenter \"created workplace chaos, endangered the safety of other employees, and acted dishonestly and unprofessionally. This included sexual harassment, workplace discrimination, and brandishing a firearm inside an office.\"\n\nMattox previously told Politico those allegations were untrue.\n\nKelly said FDLE has not received a copy of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nDeSantis' Press Secretary, Jeremy Redfern, referred to a post he wrote on X when asked about the lawsuit. The post referenced the FDLE internal investigation into Desguin and Carpenter, but didn't address the claims raised in the lawsuit.\n\nBoth Desguin and Carpenter provided statements for the Washington Post in its lawsuit against FDLE, which accused the agency of blocking the release of public records.\n\nDesguin and Carpenter were recently cleared to sue the state after the Florida Commission on Human Relations concluded its investigations, Mattox said.\n\nDesguin said he began raising concerns around 2021, when he was the special agent in charge of statewide intelligence for the FDLE, and Larry Keefe, the former public safety czar for DeSantis, asked him to get photographs and gather personal data on migrants being flown into Florida by the U.S. government. Desguin said that \"FDLE could not legally conduct name checks, capture photographs, or compile intelligence files\" without cause or reasonable suspicion.\n\nSeveral times, Keefe told DesGuin that he was getting tired of his \"constant emphasis on reasonable suspicion and criminal predicate and failing to comply with his directives would have adverse consequences for Plaintiff,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nWhen DeSantis called several meetings to discuss his intent to relocate those migrants to other states, Desguin raised concerns about the risk of being accused of false imprisonment and kidnapping, the suit says.\n\nBut Chief of Staff James Uthmeier told Glass and Desguin that it was \"imperative to complete at least \"one flight\" of the migrants from Florida to another state, the suit claims.\n\n\"Uthmeir went as far as suggesting that his tenure as their superior might be in jeopardy if this directive was not fulfilled,\" the suit states.\n\nIn a separate incident last September, Desguin said he was told by DeSantis aides that the governor needed some arrests at a neo-Nazi demonstration in Orlando, but he responded that FDLE could not arrest demonstrators who were \"participating in a First Amendment protected activity.\"\n\nDespite raising those concerns, the governor's staff insisted -- \"DeSantis was running for President at the time,\" the lawsuit says -- and FDLE agents made some arrests.\n\nAlso last fall, FDLE officials and governor's staff argued over whether a new law prevented them from releasing specific details of the governor's travel records. Janine Robinson, the head of the public records unit at FDLE, said she felt uncomfortable with the directive coming from the governor's general counsel, which ultimately cost her a promotion and raise, the suit claims.\n\nShortly after that, Desguin and Carpenter were placed on administrative leave.\n\n\"This action constituted retaliation against Plaintiff for his participation in whistleblowing activity,\" the lawsuit said, including his \"refusal to comply with unlawful directives from Defendant DeSantis and ... raise concerns about the agency's trajectory and the hostile environment fostered by Glass.\"\n\nDesguin was given the choice of retiring by Nov. 17 or being fired, the lawsuit says. When he left the FDLE, he received an affidavit of separation which said the reason for the separation was \"Retired. Not involving misconduct.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeffrey_schweers@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Jeffrey

Ron DeSantis and his top aides of forcing him to retire after he refused to carry out orders he says were illegal or inappropriate, according to a lawsuit filed overnight.\n\nShane Desguin, a career employee of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, rose to become the agency's chief of staff. He alleges his retirement in November was actually a \"wrongful termination\" and was the result of him blowing the whistle on a host of issues, including violations of state public records laws, illegal orders to arrest demonstrators without probable cause and directives to obtain photos and personal information of migrants flown to the Sunshine State without legal justification.\n\n\"Despite his stellar work performance during his employment,\" the lawsuit says, Desguin \"was subjected to disparate treatment, different terms and conditions of employment, and held to a different standard because he reported Defendants' malfeasance, gross misconduct and unlawful employment activities and was subject to retaliation thereafter.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in state Circuit Court in Tallahassee and names DeSantis and FDLE, long viewed as one of the nation's premier state-level law-enforcement agencies. Desguin is seeking unspecified damages and names both FDLE and DeSantis as defendants.\n\nRead more: https://abcnews-go-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/top-florida-law-enforcement-official-sues-desantis-alleging/story?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&id=111258138&usqp=mq331AQGsAEggAID#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17189047807782&csi=0&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FUS%2Ftop-florida-law-enforcement-official-sues-desantis-alleging%2Fstory%3Fid%3D111258138", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_dismissal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful dismissal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Department_of_Law_Enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Department of Law Enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Probable cause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circuit court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668847", "eventUri": "eng-9668847", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

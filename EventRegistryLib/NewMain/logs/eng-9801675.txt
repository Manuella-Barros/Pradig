Swift had been scheduled to perform at the venue as part of her recording-breaking Eras Tour on Thursday through Saturday, with each concert expected to draw around 65,000 people, with thousands more fans listening outside.\n\nA subsequent search of his home in Ternitz, near the Hungarian border, turned up chemical substances and technical devices that indicated \"concrete preparatory acts,\" Franz Ruf, Director General for Public Security at the Ministry of the Interior told reporters.

Authorities found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material during a search of his home on Wednesday. He was recently hired by a company providing services at Ernst Happel Stadium, and was taken into custody not far from the venue.\n\nA third teen, a 15-year-old male, was also interrogated over the planned attack, but authorities did not provide further details.\n\nInterior Minister Gerhard Karner said no other suspects are being sought at this time.\n\n\"The situation was serious, the situation is serious,\" Karner added. \"But we can also say: A tragedy was prevented.\"\n\nAll three of Swift's concerts in Vienna have since been canceled, leaving fans, many of whom spent thousands of dollars on tickets, travel and accommodations, devastated.\n\nEvent organizer Barracuda Music wrote its Instagram channel late Wednesday that \"we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for

The outlet added that neither the 19-year-old suspect nor a second suspect, a 17-year-old, appeared to have a ticket to any of Swift's shows.\n\nMore from the AP:\n\nDuring a raid of the main suspect's home in Ternitz, south of Vienna, investigators found chemical substances and technical devices that indicated \"concrete preparatory acts,\" said Franz Ruf, Director General for Public Security at the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nAuthorities also found Islamic State group and al-Qaida material at the home of the second suspect, a 17-year-old Austrian. He was employed a few days ago by a company providing services at the venue for the concerts, and was arrested by special police forces near the stadium.\n\nKarner said no other suspects are being sought, the outlet noted, although police interrogated a 15-year-old who had been in contact with both suspects.\n\nThe AP said Swift and her team haven't publicly addressed the plot or canceled shows.\n\nThe outlet in its story referenced the deadly July 29 mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed children's dance class in Southport, England, during which a 17-year-old male was accused of killing three and injuring numerous other victims. Swift at the time said she was ''completely in shock'' over the attack, the AP reported.\n\nOfficials initially said there was no evidence that terrorism was a motive in the Southport knife attack, which angered many who accused the government of covering up evidence. Police identified suspect Axel Rudakubana and charged him with three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder. Officials identified him as being from Cardiff but also noted that his parents are Rwandan.\n\nUnrest and violence erupted the day after the stabbings and have spread across the United Kingdom. Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the violence and blamed \"far-right thuggery.\"\n\nRadio host Glenn Beck, co-founder of Blaze Media, on Tuesday opined that \"two-tier justice\" -- in which police more or less ignore Muslim immigrant crime but come down hard on non-Muslims -- has been laid bare in the U.K. in the wake of the deadly knife attack.\n\nISIS took credit for a 2017 bombing attack at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi set up a knapsack bomb in Manchester Arena at the end of Grande's concert as thousands of young fans were leaving, the AP said, adding that more than 100 were injured and Abedi died in the explosion.\n\nAn official inquiry concluded that Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, didn't act fast enough on key intelligence and missed a chance to prevent the bombing, the AP added.\n\nSwift is expected to perform five concerts at London's Wembley Stadium between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her Eras Tour, the AP said.", "source": {"uri":

The co-hosts USA started their maiden T20 World Cup campaign on a scintillating manner trouncing Canada by 7 wickets with 14 balls to spare. On the other hand, 2009 Champions and last edition finalists Pakistan are set for their first game of the tournament before turning up against India in the high-profile clash on June 9th.\n\nMatch Details:\n\nUnited States of America vs Pakistan, Group A, Match 11\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas\n\nDate & Time: June 6th at 9:00 PM IST and at 10:30 AM Local Time\n\nLive Streaming: Star Sports Network and Disney+Hotstar\n\nWhat is the Pitch Report for USA vs PAK, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group A, Match 11?\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium here in Dallas has already hosted a couple of games in the tournament, producing contrasting results. The game between USA and Canada saw a total score of 391 runs while only 215 runs were scored between Netherlands and Nepal. We can expect an evenly poised surface for the contest between the USA and Pakistan.\n\nRecent form:\n\nUnited States of America: Won, Lost, Won, Won, Won\n\nPakistan: Lost, NR, Lost, NR, Won\n\nUSA vs PAK, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group A, Match 11 Probable Winners:\n\nPakistan are expected to win this match.\n\nWhat is the Expected, Probable Playing XIs for USA vs PAK, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group A, Match 11?\n\nUnited States of America\n\nSteven Taylor, Monank Patel (c & wk), Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, Nitish Kumar, Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Khan, Jasdeep Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nPakistan\n\nMohammad Rizwan (wk), Babar Azam (c), Saim Ayub / Azam Khan, Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf\n\nInjury Updates:\n\nImad Wasim has a side strain and will miss Pakistan's opener against the USA on Thursday.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Cricket Top Picks, Players for USA vs PAK, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group A, Match 11?\n\nTop Pick - Batter\n\nBabar Azam is the most technically accomplished modern-day Pakistan batter. He is the all-time leading run-scorer for Pakistan in T20Is, scoring 4023 runs in 119 T20Is at an average of 41.05.\n\nTop Pick - All-Rounder\n\nIftikhar Ahmed floats in the batting order from No.5 to No.7 and has done well lately in what he was asked for. With a range of shots at his disposal, he is considered a finisher for Pakistan.\n\nTop Pick - Bowler\n\nShaheen Afridi is a highly dangerous bowler with the new ball for his ability to swing both ways. He is only 24 and has already bagged 91 wickets in 66 T20Is with the best figures of 4 for 22.\n\nTop Pick - Wicketkeeper\n\nMohammad Rizwan holds a stunning record in T20 World Cups, scoring 456 runs in 13 matches at an average of 41.45 with the best score of 79*.\n\nX-Factor:\n\nAaron Jones registered his highest score in T20Is, scoring 94* runs in just 40 balls against Canada in the tournament opener, his innings included 4 fours and 10 maximums.\n\nWhat are the Fantasy Suggested teams for USA vs PAK, ICC T20 World Cup 2024, Group A, Match 11?\n\n1. Mohammad Rizwan (c), Andries Gous, Monank Patel, Babar Azam, Aaron Jones, Corey Anderson, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Harmeet Singh, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf (vc)\n\n2. Mohammad Rizwan, Monank Patel, Usman Khan (c), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Aaron Jones (vc), Corey Anderson, Steven Taylor, Shaheen Afridi, Saurabh Netravalkar, Haris Rauf\n\nPre-Match Analysis:\n\nA next-level hitting from Aaron Jones (94*) and Andries Gous (65) steered the home side USA to an excellent 7-wicket win over Canada on the opening day of the tournament. They made complete use of the inconsistent Canada bowling attack, taking them to the cleaners to all parts of the ground, resulting in them chasing the target of 195 well in advance which has boosted their net run rate. Aaron Jones in particular took on the aggressive route and targeted the leg side to clear the fence on 10 occasions. Earlier their bowling wasn't up to the mark, leaking runs with a lot of ease. Ali Khan, Harmeet Singh, and Corey Anderson bagged one wicket apiece.\n\nThey need to tweak their approach slightly as they face unpredictable Pakistan in their second Group tie. The co-hosts are in no intention to change their winning combination.\n\nPakistan had a tough couple of weeks in the build-up to their T20 World Cup 2024 as they became the last side to announce the squad and the results in the bilateral series against Ireland (2-1 win) and England (2-0 loss) aren't overwhelming. Imad Wasim who knows the conditions of the USA and West Indies better than anyone on the side has to miss out due to injury and is likely to be available once he recovers, this poses a huge challenge for the management as they need to alter their team combination making them to play an extra batter leaving them only five proper bowling options. Usman Khan is likely the starter for this match following his 21-ball 38 against England at The Oval in the 4th and final T20I last week.\n\nSaim Ayub and Azam Khan will fight for their places. Mohammad Rizwan and skipper Babar Azam will open the innings followed by Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Iftikhar Ahmed, and Shadab Khan. After his stupendous return from injury, Haris Rauf who bagged 5 wickets in the last 2 T20Is holds the key in the pace department that features Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, and experienced Mohammad Amir.", "source": {"uri": "in.ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score":

The fixture will be played in Dallas. The first game at this stadium was a high-scoring fixture while the second game was a low-scoring affair. The pacers will once again have a crucial role to play and all eyes will be on Mohammad Amir, who will be playing his first ICC event since 2019. Amir has come out of retirement to play the T20 WC.\n\nToss: Since it's a morning game, the team winning the toss might opt to bowl first. Like Pakistan, USA also have a good pace attack and Pakistan's defensive batsmen will have their task cut out.\n\nPitch: The two games in Dallas have produced different scores. Given Pakistan's strong bowling attack, it could be a low-scoring game if the Men in Green bowl first.\n\nWeather: The weather is clear and there is no chance of rain.

While Pakistan, led by Babar Azam, is favoured to win, their recent form suggests it won't be an easy victory. The PAK vs USA match is set for June 6 at 9:00 PM IST at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas, USA. Pakistan's recent struggles, including a loss to Ireland and a 0-2 series defeat in England, have raised concerns. They also drew a series with a weakened New Zealand side. The team has seen changes in captaincy, top-order adjustments, and players coming out of retirement. After Shaheen Afridi's brief captaincy, Babar Azam was reinstated. Despite their consistency, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan's strike rates have faced criticism for being too slow.\n\nPakistan's unpredictability remains their hallmark; they can either surprise or collapse unexpectedly. They will heavily rely on their pace attack, featuring Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf, and the returning Mohammad Amir. Conversely, USA is confident after their seven-wicket win over Canada in the tournament opener.\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas Metro Area, Texas\n\nBowlers: Saurabh Netravalkhar, Mohammad Amir, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi\n\nThis will be the first-ever T20 International encounter between Pakistan and United States Of America.\n\nAccording to weather.com, the morning weather at Dallas' Grand Prairie Stadium is expected to be bright, clear and sunny with temperatures around 35\u00b0C. You can expect a complete 40 over game.\n\nThe pitch during the night game between the USA and Canada was great for high scores, but the day game between the Netherlands and Nepal was much tougher for batters. Since the USA vs PAK match is a day game, expect the batters to work hard for every run.\n\nUnited States Squad\n\nSteven Taylor, Monank Patel(w/c), Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, Corey Anderson, Nitish

Generally, we can expect a pitch with true pace and bounce, benefiting the batters.\n\nGround history of Grand Prairie Stadium:\n\nIn the two matches played so far, both were won by the teams batting second. The average first innings total is around 150, with the average second innings total being 153. The highest total was 197/3 by the USA against Canada, while the lowest was 106/10 by Nepal against the Netherlands.\n\nFantasy insights for PAK vs USA:\n\n- Top-order power hitters from both teams will be essential picks for the game.\n\n- Pakistan's pace bowlers are likely to be more effective, making them strong fantasy picks.\n\nKey players to watch out for PAK vs USA\n\nMohammad Rizwan (PAK): Known for his consistent batting and technical prowess, Rizwan's role at the top of Pakistan's batting order will be crucial. He is a prime choice for this game due to his ability to score runs consistently.\n\nBabar Azam (PAK): As the captain of the Pakistan team, Babar Azam's role in the batting lineup is significant. He has the capability to set the pace of his innings and play long innings. His ability to convert starts into big scores makes him a valuable pick for fantasy contests.\n\nShaheen Afridi (PAK): Afridi's left-arm pace and skill in taking wickets with the new ball make him one of Pakistan's key bowlers. His ability to trouble the opposition batsmen could make him a highly rewarding choice for fantasy contests in this match.\n\nSquads for Pakistan vs USA\n\nPakistan squad for T20 World Cup: Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed.\n\nUSA squad for T20 World Cup: Monak Patel, Shayan Jahangir, Andries Gous, Nitish Kumar, Steven Taylor, Harmeet Singh, Corey Anderson, Milind Kumar, Nisarg Patel, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Ali Khan, Jessy Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar, Nosthush Kenjige.\n\nDream11 fantasy team:\n\nWicketkeepers: Mohammad Rizwan, Monank Patel, Usman Khan\n\nBatters: Babar Azam, Aaron Jones\n\nAll-rounders: Corey Anderson, Shadab Khan\n\nBowlers: Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Afridi, Saurabh Netravalkar, Naseem Shah\n\nThe USA will be high on confidence following their seven-wicket win over Canada in the tournament opener. Meanwhile, Pakistan will look to overcome their recent inconsistent form and leverage their pace attack to secure a victory.\n\n(Inputs from Agencies)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Pakistan's predicted playing XI for USA clash in T20 World Cup 2024", "body": "Pakistan and USA are set to face each other in the 11th match of the T20 World Cup at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas. The Babar Azam-led side is playing its opening game of the competition and will be keen on putting their best foot forward against the hosts who are coming off chasing down 195 against Canada in the tournament opener at the same venue.\n\nPakistan are one of the only three teams to opt against playing the warm-up matches but were involved in a four-match T20I series against England in the UK. Only two matches of that series could happen which they lost 2-0 and the men in green will be itching to get the USA out of their way ahead of the marquee India clash. Meanwhile, let us have a look at Pakistan's playing XI for their opening game of the competition:\n\nImad Wasim came out of retirement to play in the T20 World Cup but has sustained a side strain and has been ruled out of this encounter. Mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed could be the second spinner along side Shadab Khan in this case. The top four looks set for Pakistan with Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan opening the innings while Usman Khan and Fakhar Zaman will follow them.\n\nAmidst all the criticism, Azam Khan and Iftikhar Ahmed seem set to be retained in the line-up and Shadab Khan will bat at five, six or seven depending on the match situation. Pakistan will have to drop one of Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah or Haris Rauf. Looking at the conditions and variety, Amir or Rauf might have to sit out for this game.\n\nSaim Ayub will have to wait for his chance in the World Cup as his form hasn't been great in the lead up to the tournament while the only other player to miss out could be Abbas Afridi.\n\nPakistan's predicted XI for USA clash: Babar Azam (c), Mohammad Rizwan (wk), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf/Mohammad Amir, Naseem Shah", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_kukalyekar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Aditya Kukalyekar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Rauf", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haris Rauf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Amir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Amir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_Pakistan_in_2022\u201323", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English cricket team in Pakistan in 2022\u201323"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadab_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shadab Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imad_Wasim", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imad Wasim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saim_Ayub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saim Ayub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Afridi_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abbas Afridi (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Rizwan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Rizwan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Shinwari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Usman Shinwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftikhar_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iftikhar Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azam_Khan_(cricketer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Azam Khan (cricketer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrar_Ahmed_(Pakistani_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abrar Ahmed (Pakistani cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naseem_Shah_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naseem Shah (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhar_Zaman_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket-keeper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket-keeper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/06/untitled-design-2024-06-06t130839-1717659526.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Jones, their hero in the first match, grew up in the Caribbean while they also have players who began their careers in South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nPatel insists it is \"good to have diversity\" in the side but said they all come together when they plan for the USA.\n\nUSA will be wary of the challenge posed by the 2009 champions, especially their captain and star batter Babar Azam.\n\n\"Babar is a great batsman in all formats [of cricket] so his wicket will be really important,\" Patel admitted.\n\nUSA's strength lies in their experienced batting lineup but Patel said his side will face a stiff challenge from Pakistan's pace attack, especially Mohammad Amir whom they will have to \"tackle well.\"\n\nAmir, who is returning to a Pakistan World Cup squad after four years, said he wants to \"chip in\" with regular seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah.\n\n\"I've come back to a great dressing room and we have very clear plans for each player,\" Amir said in Wednesday's news conference.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who was part of Pakistan's title-winning side in 2009, said the team has moved on from their recent T20 series loss against England and are ready to start the tournament with a win.\n\n\"In World Cups, there's no margin for error so we are mentally and physically ready to win.\"\n\nThe tournament's opening match was played in Dallas and both teams were able to score in the 190s, which will be a good sign for fans who have been left concerned after the low-scoring encounters in New York.\n\nThe weather forecast is clear and sunny for the day match at the Grand Prairie Stadium.\n\nThis will be the first meeting between the two sides in any format of cricket.\n\nPakistan have had a mixed run going into the tournament, winning a T20 series away to Ireland but losing one against England last month.\n\nUSA will be brimming with confidence as they go into the match with a win in the bag and a 2-1 series win over Bangladesh last month.\n\nPakistan will have to take a call on dropping experienced leg-spinner Shadab Khan to accommodate a four-man seam attack. They could also drop out-of-form wicketkeeper Azam Khan for top-order batter Saim Ayub.\n\nSquad: Babar Azam (captain), Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Amir, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf, Abrar Ahmed\n\nUSA are unlikely to tinker with the XI that brought them their first-ever World Cup

But how will they line up for their first match?\n\nTo start with, Pakistan have one forced decision; captain Babar Azam confirmed on Wednesday that all-rounder Imad Wasim would not be available against the USA, owing to a side strain which also kept him out of the final T20I against England.\n\nBabar-Rizwan at the top?\n\nAs far as the top order is concerned, Babar had said in late May that he would bat at one down in the T20 World Cup, presumably with Mohammad Rizwan and Saim Ayub opening the batting. However, Ayub's form has been patchy of late and he was left out of Pakistan's latest fixture in favour of Usman Khan, who batted at three as Babar and Rizwan opened the innings.\n\nUsman impressed with a 21-ball 38 in that match, and appears to be the front-runner for a spot in the top order ahead of Ayub. He could come in at three or open the innings as he has done several times in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), in case the team management prefers Babar to play one down. However, with Imad now out, one wonders whether Pakistan may be tempted to return to Ayub given his ability to bowl some better-than-part-time off spin.\n\nWill Azam Khan be dropped?\n\nPakistan's middle-order is largely set in stone; Fakhar Zaman will play at number four, with Iftikhar Ahmed and Shadab Khan in the lower middle-order. Azam Khan has hit a slump with both bat and the keeping gloves recently and Pakistan may have taken the risk of dropping him if Imad had been fit. But as things stand, it looks like he will slot in at number five or six.\n\nThere is an interesting alternative for Pakistan to consider, though. Should they want very strongly to drop Azam, they could open with Ayub and play Usman at five, to give them some power through the middle overs. This is unlikely to happen, but a possibility nonetheless.\n\nFour seamers or three?\n\nThe final question mark is over Pakistan's bowling attack; will they play four seamers or three? Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Amir and Haris Rauf are pretty much nailed on to start. The pitch in Dallas last time around had something in it for the pacers even past the Powerplay, so Naseem Shah could slot in as the fourth seam-bowling option. The alternative is mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed, who might find a spot as the support to Shadab Khan, given Imad's absence.\n\nPakistan predicted XI vs USA: Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam (c), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan (wk), Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah/Abrar Ahmed.", "source": {"uri": "wisden.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

USA Preview - American Fans' First Taste of Top-Level Cricket", "body": "Pakistan vs. USA is about to be the biggest test yet for the young USA team, and it is guaranteed to be an exciting watch for American fans. Even though they're not at the peak of their powers right now, Pakistan is still a top-tier team and last edition's finalists, fielding a lineup filled with popular superstars like Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Amir, and Shaheen Shah Afridi.\n\nThese guys are crowd-pullers, so expect a packed house for this one. It's a chance for USA Cricket to showcase their skills against one of the best in the world, and for the fans, it's an opportunity to witness world-class cricket on their home turf.\n\nThe game will be played at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas, a venue that recently witnessed a run-fest as the USA chased down a target of 195 in just 17.4 overs, thanks in large part to Aaron Jones' 40-ball 94*. The pitch seems to be a haven for batsmen, but fast bowlers should also find some joy with the new ball.\n\nThe weather forecast for Thursday predicts clear skies, paving the way for a full match. Pakistani fans will be particularly relieved, having endured the frustration of three washouts in their previous seven T20Is.\n\nUSA will be riding high after their opening-day victory over Canada and their recent 2-1 series win against Bangladesh. Meanwhile, Pakistan will be approaching this match with caution, having won just one of their last five T20I series. Their recent struggles in Ireland and the UK, including losses to Ireland and England, have exposed vulnerabilities and a lack of consistent form.\n\nTeam News\n\nThe USA, fresh off their victory over Canada, are injury-free and unlikely to change their winning lineup, especially since they're playing at the same venue again.\n\nCaptain Babar Azam confirmed on Tuesday that Imad Wasim hasn't recovered from a right rib strain sustained in training. This presents a challenge for Pakistan, as Wasim had been in stellar form with both bat and ball against England in their last series. Since coming out of retirement, he's taken five wickets at an economy rate of 6.84 and scored 49 runs at an average of 49 and a strike rate of 175. He's arguably been Pakistan's best spinner this year. His likely replacement, Abrar Ahmed, could be a wildcard. While his mystery spin might trouble the USA batters, it remains to be seen if he can fill Wasim's shoes.\n\nProbable XIs:\n\nUSA: Steven Taylor, Monank Patel (capt), Andries Gous (wk), Aaron Jones, Nitish Kumar, Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Jasdeep Singh, Ali Khan, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nPAKISTAN: Mohammad Rizwan, Babar Azam (c), Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Azam Khan (wk), Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Amir, Abrar Ahmed\n\nAlthough these two teams have never faced each other in an official match, some players are familiar with each other's skills, thanks to the numerous T20 leagues around the world. Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf, for instance, got a taste of Corey Anderson's talent while playing alongside him for the San Francisco Unicorns in last year's Major League Cricket.\n\nThe former Kiwi international had a standout performance in the tournament, averaging 47 with a strike rate exceeding 145. This prior experience could prove valuable for Pakistan as they prepare to face Anderson and the rest of the USA squad.\n\nAnother intriguing matchup to watch out for is the Pakistani batters' face-off against Harmeet Singh. The left-arm spinner was the most economical bowler in the USA's match against Canada, with figures of 1-27. Given Pakistan's recent struggles against spin, this encounter could get spicy.", "source": {"uri": "propakistani.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ProPakistani"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Shadab and Azam are Pakistan's two key middle-order players who have been striving hard to regain form.\n\nAhead of their opening clash on Thursday, Amir backed the misfiring duo and believes that they are just one game away from regaining their form.\n\n\"I always say that the player who has performed and proved himself never doubts his ability. Yes, there is a bad patch in cricket. And this happens with every cricketer. All the legends also if you see in the past, sometimes even they can't perform well,\" Amir said in the pre-match press conference.\n\nDuring Pakistan's recently concluded series against England, Azam struck just 11 runs in two matches at an average of 5.50.\n\nWhile Shadab managed to put up just three runs in two matches. Even with the ball, he found it hard to make an impact with the ball. In the second T20I, he registered his worst bowling figures in the T20I format. He went wicketless and gave 75 runs in 7 overs across both matches.\n\n\"And no doubts on the ability and quality of Shadab and Azam. They play and perform all over the world. They are one game away - the kind of players that they are, they can single-handedly win the match for you,\" he added.\n\nAmir will feature alongside four pacers to spearhead Pakistan's bowling line-up.

Despite the gulf in cricketing pedigree between the two teams, USA will feel confident of pulling off a shock win over the Babar Azam-led side.\n\nIndia will take Pakistan head-on in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 on June 9, in what cricket fans are expecting to be a clash of Titans where Team India who are currently ranked at the top of the ICC T20 team rankings, will take on arch rivals who occupy the sixth spot.\n\nCo-hosts USA will look to build on their winning start at the T20 World Cup 2024 after they defeated neighbours Canada by seven wickets in the opening fixture on June 2.\n\nPakistan and USA will clash at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on June 6.\n\nWhere to watch LIVE\n\nThe match starts at 9 pm IST (June 6). It will be broadcast live on the Star Sports network and will be streamed live on the Disney+Hotstar app.\n\nIn the previous match between Canada and USA, batting first, Canada scored 194/5. USA came out strong in the second half as Andries Gous' 65 and Aaron Jones unbeaten 94 took USA home in 17.4 overs with 7 wickets to spare.\n\nSeveral records were broken during USA's run-chase, which is now the third-highest in the history of the T20 World Cup. Meanwhile, USA ranked no.18 in the world. Despite the gap in rankings and cricket pedigree, USA will feel confident when they take on the Babar Azam-led side.\n\nThe 2022 T20 World Cup finalists, Pakistan suffered a shock loss against Ireland last month. This was followed by 0-2 series drubbing at the hands of current T20 World Champions England.\n\nAlthough the recent results haven't been in favour of Pakistan, Babar Azam has urged his team to stay positive.\n\n\"We must be positive, so results will come... Conditions in the USA may pose challenges as we are going there as a national side for the first time.\" Babar said an episode of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) podcast released on June 1.\n\nPakistan will be heavily dependent on their captain and Mohammad Rizwan in this World Cup. Babar and Rizwan are Pakistan's most consistent T20 performers.\n\nAnd this is something Team India will like to watch. Both teams have a sound pace attack and ahead of the India-Pakistan game, Rohit Sharma will want to get a first up view of the opponent's potentials as their pace department features Shaheen Afridi, Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf and Mohammad Amir, who has come out of retirement.\n\nPlayers to watch out for:\n\nAaron Jones (USA)\n\nAaron Jones played a thrilling knock in the tournament opener against Canada. Jones blasted 10 sixes and four fours en route to an unbeaten 94 in only 40 balls. Jones is currently the leading run-scorer of this World Cup. Expect some more fireworks from him as he will look to blunt Pakistan's pace attack.\n\nShaheen Shah Afridi (Pakistan)\n\nIf there is one Pakistan bowler who can dent USA's batting is Shaheen Shah Afridi. Afridi is known to pick early wickets and his pace and seam movement can be a bit too much for USA batters.\n\nPitch:\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas was a batting friendly one. Both USA and Canada scored over 190 runs and the entire match saw only 8 wickets fall. Expect similar pitch for this clash too.\n\nPredicted playing XI:\n\nUSA: Aaron Jones, Navneet Dhaliwal, Pargat Singh, Nicholas Kirton, Shreyas Movva, Dilpreet Singh, Dillon Heyliger, Saad Bin Zafar, Nikhil Dutta, Kaleem Sana and Jeremy Gordon\n\nPakistan: Mohammed Rizwan, Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan, Azam Khan, Iftikhar Ahmed, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Naseem Shah, Mohammed Amir and Haris Rauf\n\nBetting Odds (bet 365):\n\nPakistan win: 1/10\n\nUSA win: 6/1", "source": {"uri": "cnbctv18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "cnbctv18.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It only dented their T20 record from the past year during which they had won only five of the 15 played.\n\nBut, regardless of the shakiness and the uncertainties, Pakistan can never be written off as a title contender, especially in the shortest format which is just as dynamic, relentless, and unpredictable as the Men in Green.\n\nPakistan have fan-favourite Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim available after they had reversed their international retirements. Babar remains a skipper with a healthy 57.33 win- percentage and there is the continuation of their tradition of possessing a pace bowling unit that makes every other team envious. Add to this their history in the event and Pakistan will look like a team that can definitely go all the way.\n\nSQUAD\n\nBabar Azam (C), Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Rizwan, Usman Khan, Azam Khan, Imad Wasim, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, Iftikhar Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Naseem Shah, Abbas Afridi, Haris Rauf\n\nPakistan's exit from the group stages of the 50-over World Cup in India was mostly because Shaheen Shah Afridi had failed to take early wickets as much as was expected of him. He has also been Pakistan's highest wicket-taker in the format this year, scalping 21 wickets in 11 games. And, considering an overall economy rate of below eight despite bowling the most crucial overs for his team, Afridi could be the key to Pakistan's success in the USA and the West Indies.\n\nWith Mohammad Amir back in the mix alongside pace spearheads Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah, Pakistan's pace unit remains a point of envy for all the other teams. Haris Rauf's return after a shoulder injury is also a plus for Pakistan as he remains a perennial wicket-taker when it comes to the shortest format.\n\nOther than Fakhar Zaman, all the other middle-order batters - Iftikhar Ahmed, Shadab Khan, and Azam Khan - have underperformed in recent times. With Babar, Mohammad Rizwan, and Saim Ayub getting the bulk of runs at the top in recent times, Pakistan might suffer when their middle order is asked to provide the goods.\n\nPakistan played Fakhar Zaman in the middle order in nine of 12 T20Is this year, with the left-hander outperforming all the other players in this regard. Pakistan will need Fakhar to repeat what he has done throughout the year - batting at a 154.71 strike rate, he has amassed 328 runs in nine matches this year.\n\nWith 238 matches under their belt, Pakistan played the most number of T20Is with a win percentage of 58.40. Next in line in this category are India (219 matches) and New Zealand (216 matches).", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Cricketing matters aside, this game has enough of a tinge of off-field spice, but add to that an American uptick in form combined with a vulnerable Pakistan unit and the cricketing matters provide intrigue of their own.\n\nUSA's win over Canada in the first game neatly illustrates the danger the hosts pose. The temperament the hosts showed, turning what appeared a near-certain losing position into a comfortable victory, is emblematic of a side high on confidence following on from their stunning 2-1 series win over Bangladesh in the build-up to the tournament. The relative familiarity with the venue also gives USA an added edge, having played against Canada at the same ground.\n\nPakistan meanwhile, have struggled to get a proper training session in, let alone an actual game, warm-up or official. Rain in Dallas for much of the past week forced Pakistan to move two practice sessions to makeshift indoor facilities, and instead of arriving early to acclimatise, Pakistan spent the past three weeks playing T20I series in Ireland and the UK. They didn't exactly showcase a fearsome side in search of a title, as inconsistent performances saw them lose oneof the three games to Ireland, and comfortably beaten in both completed matches against England.\n\nPakistan's woes have been compounded by the confirmed injury to Imad Wasim specifically brought back to the squad for his US and Caribbean experience. In addition, as the final game against England made crystal clear, the opening combination of Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam appears their only viable option, meaning much of the experimentation in the build-up over the past five months has not borne fruit. Several players severely struggling for form means there are points of weakness dotted throughout the order, with Saim Ayub, Azam Khan and Shadab Khan particularly beleaguered at present.\n\nIf the tendency to hop about from triumph to disaster without warning is a characteristically Pakistani trait, belief and self-confidence is unabashedly American. You couldn't set a better scene or plot more amenable circumstances for an upset, or at the very least a Texan thriller.\n\nUSA have no injury concerns following their win over Canada, and with the hosts playing at the same venue again, they are unlikely to tinker with a winning combination.\n\nUSA: Steven Taylor, Monank Patel (capt), Andries Gous (wk), Aaron Jones, Nitish Kumar, Corey Anderson, Harmeet Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, Jasdeep Singh, Ali Khan, Saurabh Netravalkar\n\nImad has been unable to shake off a side strain that kept him out of Pakistan's final T20I against England last week, meaning balancing the side is a problem for Pakistan. It likely means Shadab will keep his place for all-round potential, while Babar and Rizwan go back up top.\n\nPakistan: Mohammad Rizwan Babar Azam Usman Khan Fakhar Zaman Azam Khan Iftikhar Ahmed

Key dismissals by Kenjige and support from the USA bowlers kept Pakistan's batsmen, including Babar Azam and Shadab Khan, in check despite their efforts to accelerate.\n\nNosthush Kenjige delivered a standout performance, capturing three crucial wickets for 30 runs, as the USA managed to restrict Pakistan to 159 for seven in their T20 World Cup clash on Thursday. USA's decision to bowl first paid immediate dividends when Mohammad Rizwan was dismissed early by Saurabh Netravalkar.\n\nThe Pakistani innings faltered further with the loss of Usman Khan and Fakhar Zaman, who succumbed to the pressures of the USA's disciplined bowling attack. Despite a spirited partnership between Shadab Khan and skipper Babar Azam, which brought Pakistan back into the game, Kenjige's twin strikes in the 13th over turned the tide back in favor of the USA.\n\nBabar Azam's effort of 44 off 43 balls couldn't rescue Pakistan as the middle order crumbled. Late contributions from Iftikhar Ahmed and Shaheen Shah Afridi took Pakistan past the 150-run mark but failed to set a formidable total.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadab_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shadab Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Rizwan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Rizwan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Shinwari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usman Shinwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurabh_Netravalkar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saurabh Netravalkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhar_Zaman_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftikhar_Ahmed_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iftikhar Ahmed (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

According to Geo News, Naqvi wasn't happy that his team had to travel a long distance from their hotel to get to the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York.\n\nTo cater to the second-biggest cricket nation in the world, the ICC has decided to shift their hotel to just five minutes away from the Nassau Stadium. The Babar Azam-led side is scheduled to play two matches in New York, India on June 9 and Canada on June 11. Earlier, it was reported that the Pakistan cricket team was staying in a hotel that was 90 minutes away from the stadium.\n\nPakistan isn't the first team to express reservations about the facilities, with South Africa and Sri Lanka unhappy with their hotels in New York as well. Meanwhile, the India cricket team was already booked at a hotel that was just 10 minutes away from Nassau Stadium.\n\nOf course, a big reason why Pakistan was given a hotel, which was far away, was to ensure their safety following a terror threat for the IND vs PAK match. Given the history of terror attacks in the USA, the authorities are taking the threats very seriously and therefore could have stayed far away for their own safety.\n\nBabar Azam (captain), Abrar

However, only once they managed to get their hands on the elusive title, under the leadership of Younis Khan in 2009. The Men in Green had a great chance to add one more title under their belt but lost to England by five wickets in the final of the previous edition.\n\nThe Babar Azam-led 15-member side looks promising with a balanced side that has a mixture of youth and experience. They have travelled to the USA and West Indies for the ninth edition of the World Cup and are one of the contenders to qualify for the finals.\n\nIf India vs Pakistan is the mother of all battles, the T20 World Cup 2007 witnessed the peak of their rivalry. Their first meeting in the premier 20-over tournament was historic, as the winner was decided via Bowl-Out after both teams scored equal runs in the allotted overs. Unfortunately for the he Men in Green, they lost the match by 3-0.\n\nHowever, that was their only defeat in the group stage and they stormed into the finals to face arch-rivals India again. Am infamous shot selection from Misbah-ul-Haq ended Pakistan's dream win as India won by five runs in the final over to clinch the maiden T20 World Cup title. Nevertheless, Misbah was the best batter for Pakistan with 218 runs, while Umar Gul's 13 wickets was the best effort by a Pakistani bowler.\n\nPakistan achieved ultimate glory by defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. Younis Khan and Co. began the season with a loss to England, but they remained focused. Three wins in the group stage secured them a place in the semi-finals, where they defeated South Africa by seven runs. Kamran Akmal topped the run-scoring list for Pakistan (188 runs) while Umar Gul once again led the bowling attack with 13 wickets.\n\nAlso Read: New Zealand's T20 World Cup History from 2007 to 2024: Stats, records, milestones, and more\n\nPakistan advanced to the knockout stage three times in a row but were eliminated in the semi-finals this time around as Australia handed them a heartbreaking three-wicket defeat in the second semifinal in a last-over thriller. Despite losing three matches and winning only two in the group stage, the defending champions managed to enter the knockout stage. Their top scorer was Salman Butt with 223 runs, including two fifties while spinner Saeed Ajmal topped the wicket-takers list with 11 scalps.\n\nPakistan had a dominant group-stage campaign, winning four matches and losing only to India. However, their momentum was halted by hosts Sri Lanka in the first semi-final, where Mohammad Hafeez and Co. lost by 16 runs. The captain himself led the batting unit from the front with 164 runs while Saeed Ajmal led the bowling attack with nine wickets.\n\nAfter enjoying four fruitful campaigns, Pakistan failed to qualify for the semi-finals for the first time in the 2014 World Cup. Pakistan started the campaign with a seven-wicket defeat against arch-rivals India. They managed to register only two wins and finished the group stage (Group 2) in third place. Ahmed Shehzad was the top-scorer with 138 runs and right-arm pacer Umar Gul was the leading wicket-taker with 6 scalps.\n\nAlso Read: Australia's T20 World Cup History from 2007 to 2024: Stats, records, milestones, and more\n\nPakistan came to their neighbouring country with the aim of putting up a remarkable show. But it was one of the worst World Cup campaigns in their history as the Shahid Afridi-led side managed to win just one match in the group stage. Sharjeel Khan scored 112 runs while Mohammad Sami and Shahid Afridi took four wickets.\n\nAfter two poor outings, Pakistan qualified for the semi-finals in the 2021 edition. This time, the Men in Green got their revenge against India as they opened the campaign with a massive 10-wicket win over Virat Kohli's side. With five wins and 10 points, Babar Azam and his men topped the Group 2 points table. However, they suffered a five-wicket loss to Australia in the second semi-final. Babar was the tournament's top scorer with 303 runs, while spin all-rounder Shadab Khan was the top bowler for Pakistan with nine wickets.\n\nA masterclass from Virat Kohli prevented Pakistan from getting off to a positive start in the 2022 edition. The former India captain singlehandedly pulled off a four-wicket win for India with his magical 82* at the MCG. However, that did not take away the confidence of Babar Azam and company, who stormed into the finals for the first time since 2009.\n\nAn underwhelming batting performance in the summit clash against England dashed Pakistan's hope of claiming their second title. Shan Masood and Mohammad Rizwan scored 175 runs to finish as Pakistan's top scorers, while Shaheen Shah Afridi and Shadab Khan took 11 wickets each to lead the wicket-takers list.\n\nBabar Azam

The series was like a warm-up for them as they sorted out a few team combinations as well.\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium, Dallas Pitch Report\n\nGrand Prairie Stadium in Dallas has been one of the best pitches on offer in this T20 World Cup. However, even at this venue, the only day game that took place witnessed Netherlands taking 18.4 overs against Nepal to chase down 107 runs. Left-arm spinner Tim Pringle took 3/20 in his four overs in that game while the other medium pacers shared seven wickets between them. Pakistan have a potent bowling attack and USA batters will be tested.\n\nUSA: Steven Taylor, Monank Patel(w/c), Andries Gous, Aaron Jones, Corey Anderson, Nitish Kumar, Harmeet Singh, Shadley van

This game is especially significant as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first time these two teams will face off in this format, adding an extra layer of excitement and anticipation.\n\nMatch: United States (USA) vs Pakistan (PAK) Match 11, ICC T20 World Cup 2024\n\nDate: June 6, 2024 (Thursday)\n\nTime: 9:00 PM IST / 10:30 AM (Local)\n\nVenue: Grand Prairie Stadium, Dallas\n\nThis encounter marks the first-ever T20 match between the USA and Pakistan, setting the stage for a historic showdown. Both teams will be eager to assert their dominance and gain an upper hand.\n\nThe weather in Dallas on Thursday is expected to be warm, with a temperature hovering around 28\u00c2\u00b0C. The humidity will be around 60%, and a gentle breeze at 5 km/h will provide some respite. These conditions are likely to influence the gameplay, especially in a morning match.\n\nThe Grand Prairie Stadium pitch offers a unique challenge, with a tendency to play differently in morning games compared to evening matches. Expect some turn and spin for the slow bowlers early on, which might affect the batting conditions in the first innings. However, as the match progresses, the pitch is likely to become more favorable for batsmen.\n\nPredicting the outcome of this match is no easy task. The USA comes into this game with a victory under their belt, brimming with confidence. Pakistan, led by the charismatic Babar Azam, is starting their campaign and will be keen to make a strong impression.\n\nThe USA showcased their potential in their first match, demonstrating strong batting and strategic gameplay. However, Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s formidable bowling lineup, led by Shaheen Afridi and Haris Rauf, could prove challenging, especially given the morning conditions favoring bowlers. Hence, Pakistan might have the edge in this encounter.\n\nThe pitch at Grand Prairie Stadium tends to offer early assistance to spinners and seamers. Thus, loading your Dream11 team with quality bowlers from both sides could be a smart move.\n\nFocus on batsmen who can adapt quickly to changing conditions. Players like Babar Azam and Aaron Jones are known for their ability to anchor innings, making them valuable picks.\n\nAll-rounders bring balance to your Dream11 team. Steven Taylor and Corey Anderson can contribute significantly with both bat and ball, making them indispensable.\n\nSelecting the right captain and vice-captain is crucial. Opt for players who are likely to have the most impact, such as Mohammad Rizwan for his consistency or Shaheen Afridi for his potential to take early wickets.\n\nThe match is scheduled to start at 9:00 PM IST / 10:30 AM local time.\n\nThe match will be played at Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nKey players include Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Afridi for Pakistan, and Steven Taylor and Corey Anderson for the USA.\n\nThe weather in Dallas is expected to be warm with a temperature of around 28\u00c2\u00b0C, 60% humidity, and light winds.\n\nThe pitch offers early assistance to spinners and seamers but tends to become more batting-friendly as the game progresses.\n\nWhile the USA has shown promise, Pakistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong bowling lineup gives them a slight edge.\n\nThe USA vs PAK match in the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 is poised to be a fascinating contest. With both teams bringing their unique strengths to the table, fans can expect a high-octane encounter. Make sure to fine-tune your Dream11 predictions based on the latest team news and pitch conditions to maximize your chances of success.", "source": {"uri": "qrius.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Qrius"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zimble_digital@qrius.com", "name": "Zimble Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prairie_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Prairie Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream11", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dream11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haris_Rauf", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haris Rauf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Rizwan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Rizwan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Taylor_(American_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Taylor (American cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Team infighting, poor past performances & Indian expats can lead to downfall in Dallas", "body": "T20 World Cup: The Babar Azam-led Pakistan side might look like the clear winners in PAK vs USA, but one cannot rule out their knack of losing against minnows.\n\nThe first word that comes to mind when one speaks about Pakistan cricket team is, unpredictable. The team can go on to win big matches when no one gives them a chance, and lose some of the easiest matches in the world. And this phenomenon has always been their highlight, their trademark. The T20 World Cup 2024 is yet another ICC tournament where Babar Azam & Co. are the underdogs, and the fans, not just Pakistanis, better be prepared for surprises.\n\nPakistan might be one of the best T20I teams in the world, perhaps, but they look like the most vulnerable side against the minnows. Just look at how they were beaten by New Zealand 'B' side this year under. Then they also lost a match vs Ireland in the run up to the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nIn 2023, the team had gone on to lose three T20Is to Afghanistan and one to Bangladesh as well. So you just don't know with them.\n\nEver since Shaheen Afridi was made the T20I captain of the Pakistan cricket team, there were reports of a rift between Babar and him. Then once again, after Babar was made the captain again, the rift only seems to have widened. And it's visible in the performances. Pakistan all-rounder Shadab Khan recently came out in defence of Shaheen and said, \"From Shaheen's point of view, things shouldn't have changed so rapidly; instead, a system or adequate process should have been in place to ensure consistency and provide consistent results,\" he told Wisden.\n\nAs has been a clear case in all the matches that have taken place in the USA, the pitches aren't that reliable, even in Dallas, where USA played the tournament opener against Canada. While over 190 was chased in that match, the next match saw scores barely above 100. And in that situation, Pakistan batsmen might just choke with a vulnerable line up.\n\nUSA too has batsmen and bowlers, mostly of Indian and Pakistani descent, who can give a good fight. There's Saurabh Netravalkar and Ali Khan who pick up early wickets, and spinner Harmeet Singh, who is generally miserly. Among batsmen, skipper Monank Patel with Steven Taylor can be a handful. Then Aaron Jones in the middle-order, who scored 94 from 40 against Canada, is there too. Andries Gous, the South Africa-born can provide stability to the batting order.\n\nIN short, Pakistan beware, is the writing on the wall.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "madhav_agarwal@insidesport.in", "name": "Madhav Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadab_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shadab Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monank_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monank Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Jones_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Jones (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurabh_Netravalkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saurabh Netravalkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Taylor_(American_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Taylor (American cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers'_Almanack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_Gous", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andries Gous"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pakistan-t20.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The batter went for review but the decision was upheld.\n\nTowards the end, Iftikhar Ahmed (18 off 14) and Shaheen Shah Afridi (23 not out off 16 balls) played good hands to take Pakistan beyond the 150-run mark.

While Zaman perished for 11 off 7 balls, Usman Khan (3) and superstar Mohammad Rizwan (9) recorded forgetful outings as USA bowlers dominated the powerplay against Pakistan.\n\nOpening the innings with Babar for the 2022 World Cup runners-up against the co-hosts, wicketkeeper-batter Rizwan scored nine runs in the first over. However, Rizwan received his marching orders in the next over as Steven Taylor plucked a stunning catch to hand Saurabh Netravalkar his first wicket. Netravalkar, Nosthush Kenjige and Khan bagged three wickets each to restrict Pakistan to 26-3 in 4.4 overs.\n\nAt the end of the powerplay, Babar guided Pakistan to 30-3 in the low-scoring encounter. Pakistan ended up recording its fifth-lowest score in the powerplay at the T20 World Cup.

Though Mohammed Rizwan hit a six in the first over, pacer Saurabh Netravalkar got his wicket after a fine catch from Steven Taylor at slips while diving. Rizwan was gone for nine in eight balls and Pakistan was 9/1 in 1.2 overs.\n\nUsman Khan was the next batter to go. Nosthush Kenjige struck in the next over, with Nitish Kumar plucking a solid catch at long-off to send Usman back for three runs in three balls. Pakistan was 14/2 in 2.3 overs.\n\nLeft-handed batter Fakhar Zaman made his way to the crease, joining his skipper, Babar Azam. A six on his first ball started off his innings, but he soon gave his wicket to pacer Ali Khan for 11 in seven balls, with Taylor taking a fine catch again. Pakistan was 26/3 in 4.4 overs.\n\nThe pair of Babar and skipper Shadab Khan guided Pakistan out of the powerplay without any further loss of wickets. At the end of six overs, Pakistan was 30/3, with Babar (4*) and Shadab (1*) unbeaten.\n\nPakistan batters struggled to find boundaries at such a tough surface against a disciplined USA bowling duo of spinner Harmeet Singh and pacer Kenjige. However, in the 10th over, Shadab released the pressure by smashing Jessy Singh for two successive sixes and Babar ended the over with a wristy boundary.\n\nPakistan had reached the 50-run mark in 9.1 overs. At the end of 10 overs, Pakistan was 66/3, with Babar (14*) and Shadab (23*) unbeaten. 20 runs had come from the over.\n\nIn next two overs, Pakistan picked up their run flow, with Shadab being the key aggressor with two sixes and a four against Harmeet in the 12th over. Babar got a boundary as well against Kenjige in 11th over.\n\nJust when the Shadab-Babar partnership was picking up, Kenjige delivered a double blow to Pakistan, first removing Shadab for 40 in 25 balls (with a four and three sixes) and Azam Khan for a golden duck by trapping him leg-before-wicket. Pakistan was 98/5 in 12.5 overs.\n\nPakistan reached their 100-run mark in 13.2 overs.\n\nAt the end of 15 overs, Pakistan was 113/5, with Babar (37*) and Iftikhar Ahmed (6*) unbeaten.\n\nBabar freed up his arms against Harmeet and Jessy, smashing Harmeet, a former U19 World Cup bowler for India with who he had some encounters, for two fours and Jessy for four and six. However, Jessy had the last laugh, ending Babar's innings at 44 in 43 balls, with three fours and two sixes. Pakistan was 125/6 in 15.5 overs.\n\nSaurabh ended a budding partnership between Iftikhar and Shaheen Afridi as he trapped lbw Iftikhar for 18 in 14 balls, with three fours. Pakistan was 139/7 in 18.1 overs.\n\nPakistan reached their 150-run mark in 19.3 overs.\n\nPakistan ended their innings at 159/7, with Shaheen (23* in 16 balls, with a four and two sixes) and Haris Rauf (3*) unbeaten.\n\nKenjige (3/30) was the pick of the bowlers for USA. Saurabh delivered a fine spell of 2/18 in four overs, while Ali and Jasdeep Singh got a wicket each.

Changed So Rapidly': Shadab Speaks About Shaheen Afridi's Sacking As Captain - USA News", "body": "Shadab Khan has made a comeback into the Pakistan team for the T20 World Cup 2024. Pakistan's captaincy has always been a game of musical chairs, with skippers being changed after each series or change in leadership tenure. Ahead of the ongoing ICC T20 World Cup 2024, the Pakistan Cricket Board replaced Shaheen Shah Afridi with Babar Azam as 20-overs captain, a post that the latter relinquished after ICC World Cup 2024.\n\nNow on the eve of Pakistan's tournament opener against the United States of America, ace all-rounder Shadab Khan has come out in support of Afridi, who the former believes should have been given a long rope as captain. Afridi led Pakistan in five T20Is in New Zealand, which his side lost 1-4, raising doubts over the pacer's leadership qualities. The 24-year-old came into the picture as leadership material after helping Lahore Qalandars (LQ) win successive Pakistan Super League (PSL) titles.\n\nAs quoted by Wisden, Khan stated that for Afridi's sake, the system should have given ample time, while also welcoming Azam back as skipper. \"Maybe he could have been given a longer run in the role\" - Shadab Khan. \"From Shaheen's point of view, things shouldn't have changed so rapidly; instead, a system or adequate process should have been in place to ensure consistency and provide consistent results. Unfortunately, due to injury I didn't play under Shaheen, so when I returned, I was still playing under Babar, and things were relatively the same for me. Looking at it from Shaheen's perspective, maybe he could have been given a longer run in the role. However, having Babar back also provides us with an experienced captain, so not much has changed to make it harder for me.\"\n\nRecently, Afridi rejected PCB's offer to become Pakistan's vice-captain for the tournament, leading to earlier reports of the pacer pondering upon leaving the role as T20I skipper before eventually being sacked. Heading into the T20 World Cup, Azam became the most successful captain in the T20Is, surpassing Eoin Morgan and Brian Masaba's tally of 44 wins each.\n\nPakistan meets USA in Grand Prairie Stadium at Dallas this evening in a crucial Group A contest.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadab_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadab Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afridi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaheen_Afridi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shaheen Afridi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore_Qalandars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lahore Qalandars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisden_Cricketers'_Almanack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoin_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eoin Morgan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Leadership", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/things-changed-so-rapidly-shadab-speaks-about-shaheen-afridis-sacking-as-captain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The Men in Green opened their campaign in the ninth edition of the competition on Thursday (June 6) by locking horns against co-hosts USA at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas.\n\nAsked to bat first, Pakistan were off to a disastrous start as they lost as many as three overs inside the powerplay. Saurabh Netravalkar gave USA the first breakthrough by dismissing Mohammad Rizwan for 9 runs in the second over.\n\nIn the third over, Nosthush Kenjige dismissed Usman Khan for just 3 runs. Fakhar Zaman made a promising start and hit a six quickly but did not last long either as Ali Khan dismissed him in the fifth over to reduce Pakistan to 26 for 3.\n\nWith wickets falling at regular intervals at one end, Babar Azam decided to take a cautious approach. The Pakistan captain hardly went for any big shot to make sure he kept his wicket intact. However, his lack of intent has surprised many including former Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batsman Shreevats Goswami.\n\nAs Babar Azam was struggling to score at a good pace, the former cricketer took to X (formerly Twitter) to take a brutal dig at the Pakistan star. Shreevats Goswami did not mince his words as he asked Babar Azam to retire hurt and said that it would be a wise move.\n\n\"Retire hurt yourself ? Big call but would be a wise one !\" wrote Goswami who was a part of the Indian Under-19 team that won the World Cup in 2008 under Virat Kohli's captaincy.\n\nWhen a user called Goswami's comment harsh and pointed out that the Pakistan skipper has done well to stand firm at one end, the former RCB star wrote: \"He is standing there for sure.\"\n\nBabar Azam eventually failed to finish his innings on a good note and departed after scoring 44 runs from 43 balls. At a time when Pakistan would have wanted their captain to stand tall and finish the innings strongly, the right-handed batsman came up with a disappointing effort as he departed in the 16th over.

This one is tilted in favour of the bowlers but not for the right reasons.\"\n\nKarthik, who is also a commentator, added: \"It is spongy and the odd one bounces over the head. Then it stays low too. Does not make for good viewing. This pitch hasn't settled. It was made in Adelaide, kept at Miami because the weather is better there and then re-laid in New York two weeks back. Drop-in pitches are new, and has done well, especially in Australia. But here it hasn't settled.\"\n\n\"It will be a point people will be talking about ahead of the big match [India vs Pakistan] in a few days.\"\n\nMeanwhile, renowned commentator Harsha Bhogle also echoed similar views.\n\nHe added: \"It could get dangerous. Karthik was really polite when he said it's not the best. There was one ball that their [Ireland's] NO. 10 or 11 face. His weight was forward and the ball went over his head.

They were asked to bat first by the hosts and in the second over itself, USA found success against Mohammad Rizwan, who departed for nine runs off eight balls. The keeper-batter danced down the track and tried to flick it onto the left side but an edge carried the ball to the first slip where Steven Taylor was stationed.\n\nTaylor stretched towards his right and picked up a stunning catch. The ball was far off from where he was placed but the 30-year-old managed to cover the distance and grasp a low catch. Ramiz Raja who was part of the commentary believes it would be one of the 10 best catches in the tournament, while his partner Mike Haysman expects it to be the best.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistanis also lost two more key wickets of Usman Khan and Fakhar Zaman in the powerplay. The visitors looked clueless and lacklustre, which played a part in them losing three wickets early on. Skipper Babar Azam too could have made his way back into the pavilion, but he survived a run-out by a whisker. The same happened with Shadab Khan as well.\n\nAlso Read - Why Imad Wasim not playing T20 World Cup 2024 Match 11 between USA vs Pakistan?\n\nThere are a lot of expectations from Usman in the tournament, but he couldn't perform in the first match. The 29-year-old went for the glory shot but couldn't time it properly as it went straight to Nitish Kumar. The commentator Raja on air mentioned that it is not the kind of shot he usually plays but went for it anyway and lost his wicket in the process.\n\nThe Pakistan-born USA pacer Ali Khan picked up the wicket of Fakhar Zaman. Zaman looked in good touch but tried to play a lob shot, failing to time it as Taylor picked up a dolly at short fine. With that, Pakistan were reduced to 26/3 and need something special to get out of the situation.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricTracker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Taylor_(American_cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Taylor (American cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Rizwan_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Rizwan (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fielding (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramiz_Raja", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ramiz Raja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usman_Shinwari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usman Shinwari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fakhar_Zaman_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fakhar Zaman (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babar_Azam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babar Azam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadab_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shadab Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imad_Wasim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imad Wasim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.crictracker.com/media/attachments/1717688962126_Steven-Taylor.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9629229", "eventUri": "eng-9629229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

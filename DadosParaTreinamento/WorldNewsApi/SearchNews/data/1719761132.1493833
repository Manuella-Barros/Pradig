{"id": 225049966, "title": "Yale Chooses Maurie McInnis as New President", "text": "Yale University\u2019s new president will be Maurie D. McInnis, currently the president of Stony Brook University, a New York state public university, where she is known for raising the school\u2019s profile, donations and prestige. When she takes over from Yale\u2019s outgoing president, Peter Salovey, in July, Dr. McInnis, who earned masters and doctoral degrees from Yale in the 1990s, will become the university\u2019s first permanent female president. Her selection followed a search that began last fall. The delay in announcing a successor for Dr. Salovey, who leaves his post at the end of June, prompted speculation that the university\u2019s selection committee was having difficulty finding someone during a tumultuous time on university campuses. Joshua Bekenstein, a founder of Bain Capital who heads the Yale Corporation, the university\u2019s governing board, said the search committee had undertaken a \u201cvery thorough\u201d selection process.", "summary": "Maurie D.

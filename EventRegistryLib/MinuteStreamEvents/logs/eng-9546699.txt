Daniel Berger", "body": "The PGA Tour will head to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina this week for the first-ever Myrtle Beach Classic, which will be played from Thursday, May 9, to Sunday, May 12 at The Dunes Golf and Beach Club.\n\nSince the Myrtle Beach Classic is the opposite field event, it will lack most of the top-ranked players on the PGA Tour. The top stars will be competing at the Wells Fargo Championship this week.\n\nHowever as the Quail Hollow Club event is a limited 70-player-field event, the Myrtle Beach Classic field will feature many PGA Tour winners trying their luck in the opposite field event. Here's a look at five top names competing at the Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nAfter battling with injuries for nearly one and a half years, Daniel Berger returned to the PGA Tour this season. The start was tough as he missed four of the first six cuts. However, he seems to have caught some consistency lately and has only missed one cut in the past four starts.\n\nLast week, Berger finished T13 at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, his best finish so far this season. Fans can expect him to gain confidence from last week's result and put up a good show at the Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\n2) Erik Van Rooyen\n\nErik Van Rooyen is another name expected to do well this week at the opposite field event. In 12 appearances this season, he has made 9 cuts including six top 25s. Besides, he came close to winning the third title on the PGA Tour at the Cognizant Classic, where he finished T2.\n\nSpeaking of recent form, the South African golfer has made two back-to-back cuts after missing two straight cuts at the Players Championship and the Valero Texas Open respectively.\n\n3) Davis Riley\n\nDavis Riley is another name in action at the Myrtle Beach Classic. After winning his first title at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans last year and registering four other top 5 finishes in the past two seasons, he has been struggling this year.\n\nRiley has missed seven cuts in thirteen starts in the 2024 season.

According to AccuWeather's radar, rain could start in the Myrtle Beach area around 9:45 a.m. EST. It is cloudy at the Dunes Golf & Beach Club, but no rain yet.The National Weather Service's Wilmington forecast for the Myrtle Beach area predicts possible storms after 1 p.m. EST, with some being severe.\n\nNWS also reported a chance of showers and thunderstorms with a 40 percent chance of precipitation, mainly after 1 p.m.The weather could be a factor in play for the inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic tournament. Rain is expected for Thursday, May 9, 2024, and Friday, May 10, although NWS forecasts sunny skies for the weekend.\n\nThe course is quiet as the tournament gets underway. The skies are cloudy without precipitation; about 10 attendees follow the golfers as play gets under.\n\nTournament Director Darren Nelson said that ticket sales had exceeded 40,000, the initial goal for the tournament. He added that the Myrtle Beach Classic specifically focused on attracting local Grand Strand residents and spectators from nearby North Carolina. For comparison, the Carolina Country Music Fest has an attendance of about 35,000, and Bike Week has 300,000 attendees.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach area may experience severe weather Thursday, including high wind gusts and possible tornadoes.\n\nYou can also expect it to be hot and humid with temperatures reaching the mid-90s, according to the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nThe weather comes when thousands will be in Myrtle Beach for the Grand Strand's first PGA Tour tournament that begins Thursday, May 9, 2024, and runs through Sunday, May 12, 2024.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic will tee off in May 2024, bringing thousands to the Myrtle Beach area. Visitors and locals will be at the Dunes Golf & Beach Club, watching professionals play one of the Grand Strand's oldest courses in Myrtle Beach's first PGA tournament.\n\nMyrtle Beach Classic Tournament Director Darren Nelson said that close to 24,000 tickets have been sold, with the projected final total expected to be 40,000.\n\nTickets can be purchased online, but Nelson added that interested spectators can buy tickets at the gate, which is open to the public at 6 a.m., according to a fact sheet for the tournament.\n\nOnce on club grounds, viewers can either sit in one of the general admission areas or walk the course with the golfers as they play.\n\nWhile attendees are expected to wear golf attire, Nelson said there is no dress code.\n\nHe recommended that attendees bring comfortable shoes to walk in if they choose to follow the action hole-to-hole.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic will also feature local celebrities. WPDE Meteorologist Ed Piotrowski and musician Greg Rowles will be at the Myrtle Beach Classic, announcing golfers' names before they tee off, Nelson said.

It is the third Additional Event of the season, sitting opposite to the Wells Fargo Championship, which is the main event of the week. This course previously hosted the PGA Tour Champions season-ending Charles Schwab Cup Championship from 1994 to 1999, and it also hosted the PGA Tour Q-School Finals in 1973. Erik van Rooyen is the 25-1 favorite in the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic odds, followed by Ben Griffin (28-1) and Doug Ghim (30-1).\n\nThere are 12 golfers in the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic field who have a two-year exemption due to being a PGA Tour tournament winner. Are they the primary golfers you should be targeting with your 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic bets? Before making any 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up more than $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Players Championship, and the RBC Heritage this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow that the Myrtle Beach Classic 2024 field is finalized, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the Myrtle Beach Classic 2024: Ben Griffin, who is listed second in the odds this week, stumbles and doesn't even crack the top five. Griffin finished T13 in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson last week after missing the cut in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. He has finished inside the top 40 in five of his last six tournaments, but he has not posted a top-10 finish during that stretch.\n\nIn fact, his only top-10 of the season came in The American Express in January when he finished T9 at 24-under. He ranks outside the top 160 on the PGA Tour in total driving and outside the top 120 in GIR percentage. The model does not think he has the tools to put four strong rounds together this week, making him a golfer to avoid with Myrtle Beach Classic bets.\n\nAnother surprise: Victor Perez, a 35-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. Perez has already been in contention once this season, finishing T3 in the Puerto Rico Open in March when he shot 18-under.\n\nHe has made the cut in six of his last seven individual events on the PGA Tour, carding top-20 finishes in the Cognizant Classic and the Texas Children's Houston Open. Perez ranks 16th in strokes gained approaching the green and seventh in GIR percentage. This is one of the weakest fields he will face this year, so he has an excellent chance to pick up his first career PGA Tour victory. See who else to pick here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 35-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Vanna White solved that puzzle", "body": "MYRTLE BEACH -- Once tourism officials landed a PGA Tour event, choosing an ambassador required no guessing.\n\n\"Wheel of Fortune\" star and Grand Strand native Vanna White was the obvious pick.\n\n\"We all know Myrtle Beach, and we relate Myrtle Beach to golf,\" White said May 7, headlining a Myrtle Beach Classic news conference and flashing her signature smile that has graced millions of television screens for decades. \"It has been that way for a long, long time. So it's about time the PGA Tour came here.\"\n\nFestivities for the Classic kicked off May 6, and the actual tournament will begin May 9 at the Dunes Golf and Beach Club in Myrtle Beach. Thousands of visitors are expected to arrive, with local hospitality officials saying it will be an economic boost for the Grand Strand.\n\nMyrtle Beach Sports Everything to know ahead of the inaugural Myrtle Beach Classic By Danny Kelly dkelly@postandcourier.com\n\nWhite grew up in North Myrtle Beach, and she has long promoted her hometown. When she heard about the Classic, White wanted to help. Those discussions turned into event organizers unexpectedly offering her a chance to play on the green.\n\nShe plans to show off her own skills during the pro-am on May 8.\n\n\"It's going to be fun,\" White said. \"I'm really excited about it. I feel like a little kid in a candy store.\"\n\nWhite started playing golf when she was young but dropped off to focus on other activities. Since picking the sport back up about five years ago, she's trying to break 100 and hitting in the 90s now.\n\n\"You're really competing against yourself,\" White said. \"I don't take it too seriously. I just have a good time. It's a great escape. We're all so busy all the time, so it's a good way to just clear your mind.\"\n\nWhite has been a mainstay on the gameshow \"Wheel of Fortune\" since 1982. Although her longtime cohost Pat Sajak is retiring -- his last appearance being June 7 -- White said she's not going anywhere. She has already signed on for two more years with the show.\n\nMyrtle Beach Sports For these students, preparing for Myrtle Beach's PGA Tour event is part of their education By Danny Kelly dkelly@postandcourier.com\n\nBut White said she still doesn't see herself as a celebrity, and she continues to return to her hometown roots. A few times each year, she comes back to the Grand Strand to reunite with family, friends and her favorite parts of the area.\n\n\"It has changed a lot, but there's still a lot that is the same when I come home,\" White said. \"There's some of the same restaurants. Some of the same houses are there, and it always feels close to my heart when I come here.\"\n\nThe Classic has a lineup of 132 players taking the course at Dunes Golf and Beach Club. During the four-day competition, upward of 40,000 visitors are expected, with nearly 10,000 tickets sold per round.\n\nThe purse for the Classic will be $4 million, with the winner claiming $720,000. The winner will also earn PGA Tour status through 2026 and 300 FedEx Cup points.\n\nDarren Nelson, tournament director, said interest and ticket sales have \"exceeded expectations.\"\n\n\"As the first year of a new tournament, 40,000 was our goal from day one and we're closing in on that number,\" Nelson said. \"There's been a lot of interest in our hospitality suites as well.\"\n\nBusiness 'Golf fever': Myrtle Beach Classic economic impact expected to land beyond the Dunes club By Megan Fernandes mfernandes@postandcourier.com\n\nMore than 4,000 people from across the country also inquired about volunteering. Once registration opened, it was closed within eight hours because of the demand.\n\n\"The folks that run our registration software hadn't seen anything like that since the Ryder Cup,\" Nelson said.\n\nAnd Visit Myrtle Beach CEO Karen Riordan said \"golf fever\" is definitely in the air. She said a high percentage of ticket buyers are from out of town, both across the state and beyond, and the tournament could elevate the Grand Strand golf profile.\n\n\"The town is only 86 years young, but golf has been core to that identity from its earliest days,\" Riordan said. \"We've been called the golf capital of the world because of our numerous courses for various levels of experience. The exposure from this tournament allows us to show how much Myrtle Beach has evolved and shows off our courses and beaches, which are a big part of who we are as a destination.\"\n\nAs the tournament gets rolling, White said she is ready for the historic event.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm here.

He not only qualified, but made the cut, giving his career a needed boost.\n\n\"You know, I took a big leap of faith trusting in the Lord a couple weeks ago and I told my wife I couldn't have been more confident in the decision I made. We had been praying for just clarity and just direction on what to do, and discernment,\" he said last year. \"This week was an unknown after I qualified, but I think the Lord has shown, 'Matt, this is where you're supposed to be, stop, stop playing for yourself and for worldly things, just glorify me.'\"\n\nA good start at the Myrtle Beach Classic can provide another boost for Atkins, who is friends with Palmetto State golfers and YouTube stars Wesley and George Bryan IV, both also in the Classic field.\n\n\"It was pretty quiet out there this morning, not a whole lot of people out there,\" Atkins said after his round. \"Started to get a few more people out there this afternoon as we were finishing the round. But I think Wesley and George were teeing off kind of back to back, so they were probably getting all the people.\n\n\"I think maybe the next couple (days), I think it'll be busy for, if you want to call it the Bryan Bros crew, or whatever you want to call us.\"\n\nMyrtle Beach Sports A PGA Tour event needs volunteers. More than 1,300 are at the Myrtle Beach Classic. By Danny Kelly dkelly@postandcourier.com\n\nHossler, seeking his first Tour win, eagled the par-5 15th to spark his 7-under 64.\n\n\"It was solid. It was a bit of a grind,\" said Hossler, a 29-year-old with six top five finishes in his career. \"I don't feel like I hit that many greens, but I feel like I hit the ball well. Struggled judging the wind. It seemed like it swirled kind of with the storms, and my chipping and putting was excellent. All in all, obviously really happy with it.\"\n\nSixteen-year-old Blades Brown made his PGA Tour debut with a 1-over 72.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness, it was so much fun,\" said Brown, from Tennessee. \"This course has some teeth to it. I'm not 100 percent used to that yet, but I feel like the experience I'm getting this week is ... like you can't pay for this.\"\n\nMyrtle Beach News For both golfers and organizers, Myrtle Beach Classic could be a big break By Scott Hamilton Special to The Post and Courier Sign up for our Myrtle Beach sports newsletter.

The course is nestled right up on the beach in South Carolina, so wind is expected to come in off the ocean and create some potentially tricky situations for the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic field. Matt Wallace is coming off a strong showing at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, and he will be looking to build on that T4 finish against a weaker field this week. Wallace ranks inside the top 25 on the PGA Tour in scoring average, which is why he is among the top golfers on the PGA odds board for the Myrtle Beach Classic at 35-1.\n\nErik van Rooyen is the 25-1 favorite in the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic odds, followed by Ben Griffin (28-1) and Doug Ghim (30-1). Which golfers should you back with your 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic bets? Before making any 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up more than $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Players Championship, and the RBC Heritage this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow that the Myrtle Beach Classic 2024 field is finalized, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the Myrtle Beach Classic 2024: Griffin, who is listed second in the odds this week, stumbles and doesn't even crack the top five. Griffin finished T13 in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson last week after missing the cut in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. He has finished inside the top 40 in five of his last six tournaments, but he has not posted a top-10 finish during that stretch.\n\nIn fact, his only top-10 of the season came in The American Express in January when he finished T9 at 24-under. He ranks outside the top 160 on the PGA Tour in total driving and outside the top 120 in GIR percentage. The model does not think he has the tools to put four strong rounds together this week, making him a golfer to avoid with Myrtle Beach Classic bets.\n\nAnother surprise: Andrew Novak, a 40-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He has a much better chance to win it all than his odds imply, so he's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. Novak missed the cut in his first three tournaments of the season, but he has responded with an outstanding stretch of play.\n\nHe has made the cut in eight of his last nine events, including top-10 finishes at the WM Phoenix Open, Mexico Open and Cognizant Classic. Novak finished T23 in the Zurich Classic before carding a T30 finish in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson last week. He ranks eighth on the PGA Tour in sand save percentage, which sets him up for success at a beach course that features plenty of bunkers. See who else to pick here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds of 35-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

He's made three cuts in 10 PGA Tour starts so far, earning more than $177,000 in official money.\n\nThough he's new to the Tour, he's already learning some lessons.\n\n\"I think just being more comfortable being myself throughout the weeks, really,\" he said. \"What I mean by that is not trying to be a rookie and overprepare, show up really early and stay out here all day.\n\n\"Just kind of conserve energy and do what I do that got me here ... You're on the PGA Tour, you're here and you're so excited. (Veterans) said, 'Just do your normal routines, and that's what I'm trying to do now, get back into that mode.\"\n\nMyrtle Beach News For both golfers and organizers, Myrtle Beach Classic could be a big break By Scott Hamilton Special to The Post and Courier\n\nAnother PGA Tour rookie in the field is Jimmy Stanger, a 29-year-old from Tampa who played college golf at Virginia. He's actually won twice before at Dunes Golf and Beach Club, winning the Southern Amateur and General Hackler Collegiate Championship in 2016.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd be a pro golfer if wasn't for this golf course,\" Stanger said. \"(Winning here) gave me a lot of confidence to know that I could continue coming forward.\"\n\nThe PGA Tour announced the Myrtle Beach Classic in May of 2023, and Stanger recalled his reaction.\n\n\"I remember laughing so hard,\" he said. \"I remember having a good start to the year and thinking, how funny would it be after winning here twice that I would be coming back for the third time for a three-peat?\"\n\nThe field has its share of vets, of course, including 43 PGA Tour winners. Brandt Snedeker has nine Tour wins, and he and Greenville native Bill Haas have won FedEx Championships.\n\nNorth Augusta's Matt Atkins won \"The Q at Myrtle Beach,\" an 18-hole qualifier at TPC Myrtle Beach that featured eight pros with ties to South Carolina and eight popular golf YouTubers vying for one spot in the Classic field. Atkins won in a playoff over George Bryan IV, who also received a sponsor exemption to compete this week.\n\nBryan is joined in the field by his brother, Wesley Bryan. Other Palmetto State notables are Ben Martin (Greenville), D.J. Trahan (Kiawah Island), former Wofford golfer William McGirt (Bluffton), Tommy Gainey (Hartsville), Richy Werenksi (Aiken), former Clemson golfer Jonathan Byrd, Jacob Bridgeman (Inman), Carson Young (Greenville), Andrew Novak (Academic Magnet High School), Matt NeSmith (Aiken), Kevin Kisner (Aiken) and Morgan Deneen (Myrtle Beach).\n\n\"It's awesome, all the South Carolina guys we have here this week,\" Crowe said. \"It's just going to be cool, and hopefully one of us can win this week. That would be awesome for South Carolina.\"\n\nMyrtle Beach News The Myrtle Beach Classic needed an ambassador. Vanna White solved that puzzle.

Some have a familiar track record to those following golf for years, while others are less known to the public.\n\nHere are three golfers worth watching during the Myrtle Beach Classic:\n\nWith nine career PGA Tour wins and more than $40 million in career earnings, Snedeker is best remembered for winning the 2012 FedEx Cup. Currently ranked 699th in the Official World Golf Ranking, Snedeker has participated in 12 events this year and made the cut in four of them.\n\nIndeed, Snedeker was recently on the receiving end of a viral mishap by a golf fan. At the Zurich Classic in April 2024, Snedeker hit a driver that bounced nearby fans, and one of them grabbed the shot, thinking it was a souvenir.\n\nThe incident had a minimal impact on Snedeker's par later on the hole, as the fan ultimately realized his mistake and dropped the ball, according to Golf.com. The second golfer to watch out for booked his ticket to the Myrtle Beach Classic in viral fashion, although it was for his play, not fan obstruction.\n\nMatt Atkins\n\nAn alum of the University of South Carolina Aiken, Atkins won a spot to play in the Myrtle Beach Classic in a unique way.\n\nAtkins, who finished tied for 29th in the 2024 PGA Korn Ferry Veritex Bank Championship in April 2024, won The Q at Myrtle Beach at TPC Myrtle Beach to earn his spot in the Myrtle Beach Classic. The Q was a tournament between golf social media influencers and professionals that received close to 900,000 views on YouTube. Atkins won after going into a playoff round with fellow competitor and PGA pro George Bryan IV.\n\nPlaying in PGA Tour tournaments is nothing new for Atkins, and neither is teeing off at the Dunes Club. He qualified for the 2011 Southern Amateur Championship after playing a round of golf there. Atkins still remembers the course's notorious 13th hole, which caused problems due to its long distance and massive water hazard.\n\n\"It just felt like the more aggressive I tried to get off the tee, the more pointless it was for me because I was never going to get there anyway,\" Atkins said. \"It just felt like I was taking the long way around the hole the whole entire time.\"\n\nFor Atkins, the Myrtle Beach Classic is also a return to where he first found his passion for the game. As a kid, Atkins said he first started playing golf with his dad while on vacation in Myrtle Beach. While a fun hobby at the time, the Grand Strand serves as the genesis point for his golf career.\n\n\"That's what first sticks out to me when I think about playing golf and Myrtle Beach,\" Atkins added. \"(I) have a lot of memories playing with my dad.\"\n\nIndeed, a player Atkins knows well is the third golfer worth watching out for during the Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nGeorge Bryan, IV\n\nDespite finishing second in The Q, Bryan received a spot on the Myrtle Beach Classic roster during a video call from Tournament Director Darren Nelson. Bryan, who turned pro in 2010, is a Palmetto State native and attended the University of South Carolina.\n\nBryan played in one PGA Tour tournament before the Myrtle Beach Classic, the 2022-23 Butterfield Bermuda Championship, at the Port Royal Golf Course in Hilton Head, S.C. Bryan is also a popular YouTuber. He and his brother Wesley, a PGA Tour pro, operate the Bryan Bros Golf channel, which has 356,000 subscribers.\n\nHis entry is particularly sweet, considering his relationship with Atkins.\n\nWhile Atkins emerged as the victor of The Q, he believed he missed some shots as the tournament continued, which might have cost him a chance at the Myrle Beach Classic. Needing an Eagle to stay alive, which he thought was unlikely, Atkins was content to lose to his friend George Bryan; however, an errant chip from Bryan got Atkins back into the event.\n\n\"I told my friend, 'Hey, you know what, at least it was George' because I honestly felt like it was over,\" Atkins said. \"It was really bittersweet.\"\n\nIndeed, Bryan's entry into the tournament isn't controversial, but the method used to include him has come under scrutiny from some PGA Tour golfers.\n\nBryan was added to the Myrtle Beach Classic via a sponsor exemption. While on-course performance dictates much of a tournament's roster, a sponsor exemption grants a tournament a set amount of spots for players who weren't initially qualified to participate.\n\nPGA Tour golfer Dylan Wu, an expected participant in the Myrtle Beach Classic, criticized the sponsor exemption system in March 2024, although Wu did not refer to Bryan at the time.\n\n\"Sponsor exemptions going to the same players every elevated event doesn't seem to follow the 'play better' saying. Seems like 'be more famous' or 'know the right people,'\" Wu wrote in an X, formerly known as Twitter, thread.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_morse@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Ben Morse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Magazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf Magazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veritex_Bank_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veritex Bank Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Atkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Atkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_of_Myrtle_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TPC of Myrtle Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Strand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Strand"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina_Aiken", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of South Carolina Aiken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Wu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Wu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Royal_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port Royal Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Head_Island,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hilton Head Island, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Beach Soccer", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/latest-news/yuch52/picture285939746/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MYB_0226dunesclubmediaday02", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546699", "eventUri": "eng-9546699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

About 40,000 total clicks through the Dunes Golf & Beach Club turnstiles, if all goes right.\n\nAfter all, the self-professed \"Golf Capital of the World\" can now claim a true connection with the sport's biggest league by hosting the Myrtle Beach Classic, a PGA Tour event. For a week, golf in the Grand Strand will be centered on guys who play for a living rather than visiting hackers teeing off on one of 100 local courses or the families of five puttering around mini-golf greens.\n\nEven the tournament's name communicates legitimacy, with the marketing organization Visit Myrtle Beach agreeing to four years as title sponsor. That's a hefty commitment under any circumstances. It's extra heavy given the volatile state of professional golf - especially as the once-venerable PGA Tour is constantly reinventing itself by placating its membership with more money to fight off LIV Golf, a Saudi Arabia-backed newcomer with limitless cash.\n\nStill, Myrtle Beach is betting on itself.\n\nTrepidation? None at all.\n\n\"Myrtle Beach is the 'Golf Capital of the World,' and holding a PGA Tour event along the Grand Strand is a natural fit,\" Karen Riordan, president and CEO of the Myrtle Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, said in an email. \"We're thrilled to be able to sponsor this event for the next four years and have already seen the excitement circling around this week's tournament from our local community, the golf world and those who have been waiting for this day to come for years.\"\n\nIndeed, it's been a long time coming. The rub, however, is that another PGA Tour event will be rolling at the same time 187 miles away in Charlotte.\n\nAnd with brighter spotlights.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Championship will include dozens of the world's top-ranked players in a limited, 70-man field competing for a $20 million purse, the winner getting $3.6 million. There isn't a cut, meaning just appearing at Quail Hollow Club for four days guarantees someone at least $40,000.\n\nBy contrast, the Myrtle Beach Classic will have a 132-player field with a cut coming after 36 holes. The last man standing wins $720,000, with last place taking around $6,700 - or maybe enough to pay the week's expenses. And the guys who don't make it to the weekend just have to suck up the loss and move on to the next opportunity.\n\nThe field in Myrtle Beach will feature no more than 11 players ranked inside the top 100 of the Official World Golf Rankings, led by Ryan Fox at No. 61. Meanwhile, the Wells Fargo will have seven of the top 10 playing, led by No. 2 Rory McIlroy. Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler is absent to be with his pregnant wife; No. 6 Ludvig Aberg has an injured knee; and No. 5 Jon Rahm is ineligible after defecting to LIV Golf.\n\n\"We certainly know there's another event being run the same week,\" said Darren Nelson, tournament director of the Myrtle Beach Classic. \"The sponsors were super-excited to even find a date on the schedule. Being opposite another event really didn't bother them because these events don't come along very often. And all the ingredients are here to host a PGA Tour event.\"\n\nAnd that's what matters to the golfers - they just want to play.\n\nPlaying 'opposite events,' building confidence\n\nJonathan Byrd, a South Carolina native, was an all-America golfer at Clemson before turning pro in 2000.\n\nHe debuted on the PGA Tour two years later and has won five times, his last victory the 2011 Hyundai Tournament of Champions. Those are nice accomplishments - ones the rank-and-file fan at either tournament this week won't be able to claim - yet not enough to sustain him as he gets older.\n\n\"I'm a guy in a position where I need starts,\" said Byrd, 46. \"So I'm wanting to play in any event I can.\"\n\nByrd knows his window on the PGA Tour is closing and the gap between the elite and the rest is only widening. So, he has to make the most of what chances he has and that's where weeks such as this come in.\n\nAlternate-field events - or \"opposite events\" - have been a part of the game for about as long as there have been professional tours. Those tournaments provide chances for golfers who might not qualify for one of the elite events to play. There are fewer FedEx Cup points offered, no automatic invitation to the Masters and, again, far less money.\n\nBut they count.\n\nThat is what's happening this week, with the Wells Fargo Championship being an elite Signature Event - one of eight PGA Tour stops with bloated purses and shaved-down fields.\n\nEric Baldwin, the PGA Tour's vice president of operations and fan engagement, said each tournament will have the same amount of manpower: up to 30 people from the tour's HQ overseeing rules, course conditions, player relations, etc., along with a couple of hundred folks working with television and digital properties. Lots of moving parts, for sure, though synchronized through years of repetition.\n\nThe last time two tournaments ran concurrently was in April, when the tour set up shop on Hilton Head Island and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. Scottie Scheffler won at Harbour Town Golf Links, further cementing his status as the world's top-ranked player. Billie Horschel won in the Dominican, a victory that qualified him to play for big bucks in Charlotte. It's debatable if Horschel makes it to Quail Hollow without that win.\n\nPerhaps the case of Brice Garnett is a better example of what one good week can do.\n\nThe 40-year-old entered the Puerto Rico Open (opposite the Arnold Palmer Invitational) ranked 535th in the world. But he made a birdie on the fourth playoff hole for his second career PGA Tour win and jumped up to 196th. And the momentum has carried over. Garnett finished tied for 35th at the Players Championship (the mythical fifth major) followed by tying for 18th at the RBC Heritage and 11th last week at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.\n\nMaybe, more importantly, that win in Puerto Rico guaranteed him a full-time job via PGA Tour membership good for the next two years - something that appeals to all golfers, including the likes of Byrd.\n\nCurrently ranked 670th, Byrd has made only three starts - two of which have been opposite events. He has missed 13 straight cuts going back to the RBC Canadian Open last June, but keeps waiting for that one week when everything can turn around.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic needed an ambassador. Vanna White solved that puzzle.\n\n\"I feel fortunate to play the opposite events,\" Byrd said. \"If you look back - probably eight, nine, 10 years ago - I would've wanted to play the other events. But the way I've performed the last few years, ... I would've loved to have been in Hilton Head and the designated events, but I kind of feel I'm a little distant from that.\n\n\"But I know it can only take two or three great weeks and you're right back in that mix with some confidence. And I think guys are going to really like coming there.\"\n\nWhat could the Myrtle Beach Classic become?\n\nIt was announced Myrtle Beach was getting a PGA Tour spot last May. Organizers put out an online call for volunteers. Registration shut down eight hours after officially opening in December, with 1,500 folks enlisting (a standard number regardless of the tournament according to Baldwin).\n\n'Golf fever': Myrtle Beach Classic economic impact expected to land beyond the Dunes club\n\nThe software company handling sign-ups compared it to the enthusiasm it experienced when signing people up to work the Ryder Cup. And the majority of those volunteers aren't full-time residents. They're either people who have a second home in the area or are double-dipping by serving as a tournament volunteer along with being a vacationer.\n\nHospitality quickly sold out, tickets purchases snowballed and web traffic through VisitMyrtleBeach.com picked up.\n\nYet that's all not completely unusual for a first-year event. What happens this year with the Myrtle Beach Classic will go a long way toward determining 2025 and beyond - or at least as much as it can control.\n\nFor these students, preparing for Myrtle Beach's PGA Tour event is part of their education\n\nThings such as the plain fact that the golf course matters. The Dunes Club has some pro golf history, having been the site of the Champions Tour championship for five years during the 1990s along with some qualifying events and other tournaments.\n\nThe weather matters, too. Myrtle Beach in May - even with the occasional pop-up storm - is less volatile than, say, central Kentucky in July. Weather has hindered the Kentucky Championship (formerly the Barbasol Championship) since it moved from Alabama in 2015.\n\nIt also started as an opposite event - running the week of the Open Championship - before being moved up a week on the schedule. The Kentucky Championship is now held the week of the Scottish Open and, while technically not considered an opposite event, it still has all of the points, money and invite limitations of the alternate-field tournaments.\n\nA better model for Myrtle Beach to aspire to could be the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi.\n\nThat tournament has been an official event since 1994, although it's different versions have been as a marginalized event on the now-defunct fall series, as an opposite event. It was even skipped one year. But through persistence and fortuitous scheduling, it received full status in 2019.\n\nAlong with that came the perks most other tournaments have. But, for the likes of Byrd, the most important factor is merely being able to play.\n\nBecause fortunes can't shift without that singular opportunity.\n\n\"So it all can change - that's what keeps bringing us back,\" Byrd said. \"I look at a week like Myrtle Beach and I'm grateful to be in the field and thankful to be there.\"\n\nSign up for our Myrtle Beach weekly update newsletter.

I eagled 18 to get in the playoff. I had checked the scores walking off 16 green and also 17 green. I knew 5 under would be a playoff. He looked at me walking to 18 tee and said let's go make three. And we did.\"\n\nWhile the urgency of a Monday qualifier is different -- with a low round generally required to earn a spot in the main tournament -- McGirt said there wasn't much pressure, despite the fact he wanted to qualify for the event not far from his childhood home in Fairmont.\n\n\"There really isn't much pressure in those qualifiers to me,\" McGirt said. \"You have to play well and you have to be a bit lucky because you can play a phenomenal round and have four people play better than you and you have nothing to show for it. I just try to play the best I can and see what happens.\"\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic, being conducted for the first time, is an alternate-field PGA Tour event being played at The Dunes Club, a 7,450-yard Robert Trent Jones design. The course has previously hosted the U.S. Women's Open in 1962 and the PGA Tour Champions' season finale in the 1990s, but this week will be the Grand Strand's first event on a major professional tour since 2000.\n\nMcGirt, who is playing the 2024 PGA Tour season on conditional status, was the third alternate for the event before earning his spot through the Monday qualifier. Getting into the field for this event in particular was significant for McGirt.\n\n\"I really wanted to play this event pretty bad,\" McGirt said. \"Growing up 65 miles or so from Myrtle Beach, I've spent plenty of time here. We used to spend a week every year at a place about a mile from the Dunes Club. I used to look over every time we drove by a wish I could play the course. I've actually only played it once and that was the week before I went to Wofford to start my freshman year. It's been almost 27 years. I remember a few holes but not many.\"\n\nMcGirt will tee off on the first hole at 11:41 a.m. on Thursday and on the 10th hole at 7:01 a.m. Friday, paired with Nick Watney and Callum Tarren.\n\nMcGirt spent Tuesday and will spend Wednesday preparing for the event by familiarizing himself with the course, as will the rest of the field in the first-time event.\n\n\"I know they have lengthened the course by about 500 yards or so,\" McGirt said. \"It'll be interesting to get to see it (Tuesday). I think the prep will be about the same as any other week except maybe spending more time on and around the greens since I'm not familiar with them. I picked up a yardage book (Monday) when I registered and the greens are much more shallow that I remember. The golf course looked like it was pristine. The guys I talked to all raved about the condition of it. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nMcGirt enters the Myrtle Beach Classic ranked 214th in the FedExCup standings for the 2024 season. He will make his third start of the PGA Tour season, after a tie for 43rd at the Corales Puntacana Championship three weeks ago; he also missed the cut the following week in a Korn Ferry Tour event in Texas.\n\nMcGirt has made the cut in seven of his last eight PGA Tour starts, dating back to last July, with a best finish of tied for 28th at the RSM Classic last November.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic is an alternate-field event, with less points and prize money than the Wells Fargo Championship being played this week in Charlotte, which has a stronger field as one of the PGA Tour's Signature Events.\n\nErik Van Rooyen and Ben Griffin are among the betting favorites in a wide-open Myrtle Beach field. Other notable names in the field include Daniel Berger, Wesley Bryan, Kevin Kisner and former FedExCup champions Brandt Snedeker and Bill Haas.\n\nSports editor Chris Stiles can be reached at 910-816-1977 or by email at [email protected].

He'll do that this week at 16 years old, competing in the Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nBrown, a three-time TSSAA boys golf individual state champion and the top-ranked golfer in the Class of 2026, will make his PGA Tour debut in South Carolina on a sponsor exemption.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic is a new PGA Tour event being played alongside the Tour's main tournament this week, the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"For this to be a reality is absurd,\" Brown said. \"But I'm just treating it like any tournament. It's a PGA Tour event, yeah, and not many 16-year-olds can say (they've played in one.) But I'm just going into the event trusting my game and overall trying to have some fun as well.\"\n\nNotable names in the Myrtle Beach Classic include former Vanderbilt and Montgomery Bell Academy star Brandt Snedeker, a nine-time PGA Tour winner, plus Billy Horschel, Beau Hossler, Daniel Berger and Kevin Kisner.\n\nBrown is ranked No. 4 in the AJGA rankings and No. 176 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking. He made national headlines in August when he broke Bobby Jones' record as the youngest medalist in U.S. Amateur history, tying for first place in the tournament's stroke play portion. Brown was eliminated in the match play portion in the Round of 32.\n\nHe joins pro golf's recent trend of teenage phenoms playing PGA Tour sponsored events. England's Kris Kim, 16, debuted at The CJ Cup Byron Nelson last week. Miles Russell, 15, tied for 20th at the Korn Ferry Tour's Lecom Suncoast Classic last month.\n\nMore: How 16-year-old phenom Blades Brown may be among best golfers in Tennessee history\n\nBrown and Russell talked before the tournament about what professional competition is like.\n\nThe course conditions at The Dunes Golf and Beach Club are windy, Brown said, but the soft greens might offer more scoring opportunities.\n\n\"I think a solid goal would be to make the cut. I think that would be really cool, to be able to compete on the weekend,\" he said.\n\nBrown isn't nervous and neither is his dad.\n\nMore: Comedian Nate Bargatze breaks Morgan Wallen's Nashville arena record, steals chair to keep it that way\n\n\"There's no expectations on Blades,\" said Parke Brown, who is feeling much improved after finishing chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia last summer. \"His game is so solid. I don't worry about him. I know he'll do well. Just being here and competing is a victory.\"\n\nWho is Blades Brown? NIL deals, what to know about 16-year-old making PGA Tour debut this week\n\nBrown, a sophomore at Brentwood Academy, hit a turning point in his career by breaking golf legend Jones' record as the youngest medalist in U.S. Amateur championship history.\n\nJones set the U.S. Amateur record at 18 years old. The mark had stood since 1920.\n\nBrown shot an 8-under 64 to tie the Colorado Golf Club course record and finish as co-medalist. He finished higher than numerous college stars, including Caleb Surratt, the former Tennessee star who left college in February to join the LIV Tour.\n\nMore: Brentwood Academy's Blades Brown ties TSSAA scoring record to win 3rd straight boys golf state title\n\nBrown's performance was the starting point for sponsor exemption into the Myrtle Beach Classic, as well as financial opportunities. He is being represented by Sportfive sports marketing agency and has NIL deals with Callaway and New Jersey-based Transcend Capital Advisors.\n\nTranscend also has an NIL golf partnership with Virginia star Benjamin James, who is No. 5 in the World Amateur Golf Rankings, and previously had a deal with Surratt before he went pro.\n\n\"Luckily with golf, as soon as one door opens, 50 doors open,\" Brown said. \"I'm so thankful and blessed to be given these opportunities.

The tournament will be held from May 9 to 12 at the Dunes Golf and Beach Club in South Carolina.\n\nBrown will be making his PGA Tour debut at Myrtle Beach. He said that he aims to make the cut at the event (via PGA Tour):\n\n\"It'd be awesome to make it to the weekend. That's probably my biggest goal this week. ... All my friends have sent me texts like, 'Hey Blades, good luck this week. Praying for ya.' I'm so excited for this week.\"\n\nLast year, Brown broke a century-old record of Bobby Jones by becoming the youngest stroke play co-medalist in U.S. Amateur history. Brown is currently a student at Brentwood Academy in Nashville in his second year of high school and is expected to graduate in 2026.\n\nThe Tennessee native is ranked 4th in the Rolex AJGA rankings. Talking about his love for golf, he said:\n\n\"I love golf. Playing golf brings me so much joy in life: visualizing shots, making calculations, then executing is awesome. It's so much fun. God's given me the ability and the talent, and to be able to put that on display for others is a driving factor.\"\n\nAt the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic, Brown will play alongside one of his mentors, Brandt Snedeker. Snedeker appreciated Brown and said:\n\n\"He's such a great kid and well-rounded kid. Got a great head on his shoulders. I just told him enjoy it, have fun ... Not to go too fast, and just really enjoy and live in the moment. He's gonna have a bunch of first-time things come up in his life, so it's gonna be awesome for him.\"\n\nWhen will Blades Brown tee off at Myrtle Beach Classic?\n\nBlades Brown will tee off at 8:07 am ET at the Myrtle Beach Classic. He will tee off alongside Adrien Dumont De Chassart and Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen.\n\nBlades Brown's mother Rhonda Blades Brown has played in WNBA as a point guard for Vanderbilt. She was the first player to make a three-pointer in the WNBA history. Brown, like his mother, was a point guard in the first year of high school. However, his father Parke Brown wanted him to play golf.\n\nHe said that both his parents have different approaches to his game. He said (via PGA Tour):\n\n\"She's my mom. She gives me hugs, encourages me all I can. My dad's like, 'Hit it at the pin.'\"\n\nBrown's favorite player is Jordan Spieth who left a great impression on the 16-year-old. Brown said (via PGA Tour):\n\n\"My favorite player is Jordan Spieth, who came up beside me on the ropes at the Masters and talked to me for a few minutes,\" Brown reflected. \"There's no way he remembers it, but it meant everything to me. ... I want to do that to others someday.\"\n\nThe winner at the 2024 Myrtle Beach Classic will win $720,000. 132 players will compete for the total purse of the tournament which is $4 million.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rohit_yadav@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Rohit Yadav", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandt_Snedeker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandt Snedeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Jones_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Jones (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brentwood_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brentwood Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhonda_Blades", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhonda Blades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorbj\u00f8rn_Olesen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Outdoors", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/317fe-17152414498972-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546699", "eventUri": "eng-9546699", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 148, "textEnd": 159}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Things now however are changing.\n\nThis week's Myrtle Beach Classic (MBC) in South Carolina is making PGA Tour history, with the event offering a spot to a YouTube golfer - albeit a very good one. George Bryan will tee it up at The Dunes Golf & Beach Club having risen to stardom thanks to his Bryan Bros YouTube channel.\n\nThe other half of the channel is his younger brother Wesley, a well established PGA Tour pro who has one win to his name at the 2017 RBC Heritage. Aptly the pair will tee it up alongside each other this week.\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy battling conflicting emotions as big gesture reveals true PGA Tour feelings\n\nREAD MORE: LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nGeorge was given the chance to compete at the Myrtle Beach Classic via a PGA Tour-first, after the tournament opted to hold a pre-event qualifier with a twist. Back in March 'The Q at Myrtle Beach' saw eight YouTube golfers and eight pros compete for a spot in this week's event.\n\nBryan found himself in the YouTube category, and with a hole to spare held a two-shot lead which he later squandered following a bogey at the 18th. He was joined by Korn Ferry Tour veteran Matt Atkins in a playoff, and it was the experience of the latter that helped him prevail to earn the PGA Tour spot.\n\nIt was not all bad for the YouTube star though, who was then handed special invite to compete by Myrtle Beach bosses on the back of his impressive showing in the qualifier. On the surface, the idea of offering a spot on the PGA Tour to YouTube golfers raised the eyebrows of the sport's purists.\n\nHundreds of hard-working professionals battle week-in-week-out to play the likes of the Korn Ferry Tour and Challenge Tour among others, with a spot at a PGA Tour often the golden ticket. So, the fact this opportunity was handed to a group of guys who play the game to make content did not sit right with many.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nFor the Myrtle Beach Classic however it was a piece of marketing genius. Being held this week, the tournament is in the shadow of the Wells Fargo Championship, taking place at the same time as the PGA Tour Signature event with all the circuit's big names (bar Scottie Scheffler) in action.\n\nThe MBC therefore needed some way of getting eyeballs glued to their event, and what better way than breaking into the YouTube space? The YouTube golf scene has enjoyed a meteoric rise recently, with names such as Rick Shiels (2.79m subscribers) and Good Good (1.5 million) the big game players, donning more followers than the PGA Tour's official channel.\n\nIt has been no secret that viewing figures in professional golf have fallen in recent years, most notably coming at this year's Masters, with numbers from the final round at golf's flagship event down 20 percent on the year before. One key reason behind the switch off appears to have been the civil war that has bubbled over at the top of the professional game between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf.\n\nThe financial arms race between the two rival tours has taken centre stage, which has become a tiresome tirade for the average golfer watching at home. When it comes to YouTube golf and viewership though, the figures are trending in the opposite direction, with channels more popular than ever before.\n\nNow could it be that fans who have grown tired with the PGA Tour-LIV fallout have since turned to the fun and relaxed nature of YouTube golf match-ups? It remains to be seen, however the figures do match up. One man who was one of the eight YouTube stars battling it out for a Myrtle Beach was Manchester-based Peter Finch, who has become one of the most popular faces in the YouTube golf space, with over 633,000 subscribers.\n\nSpeaking to Mirror Sport in the aftermath of his PGA Tour attempt, Finch admitted that he believes Myrtle Beach's decision to host the qualifier only vindicates the seismic interest modern fans have in YouTube golf. \"What is shows more than anything is where people's attention is. If Eight years ago, if Myrtle Beach would have said 'we're going to get people who create content online to qualify for a PGA Tour event', It wouldn't there is not a chance. They would have been laughed at.\n\nPeter Finch competed in the qualifier\n\n\"It is a sign of where people are paying attention to golf.\" Finch went on to reference the viewership decline on the PGA Tour and rise of online content, and believes there is some correlation. \"There was a soundbite on how people who watch professional golf and the viewership has decline by about 20 percent, and what we have found over the past year is our figures have increased by about the same,\" Finch said.\n\n\"That could be a complete coincidence, or that could be a sign that people are tuning out of professional golf and watching more online content because I think the connection between the players and the fans has eroded a little bit. The way LIV has taken a lot of the best players to their tour - you are a lot less likely to tune in if your favourite player isn't in contention.

Fellow content creator Bryan will get the chance to make history though, and describe his YouTube background, has shown he already was it takes to compete.\n\nThe vlogger is making his second PGA Tour start, having competed in last year's Butterfield Bermuda Championship, making the cut and finishing in a tie for 69th.

He'll do that this week at 16 years old, competing in the Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nBrown, a three-time TSSAA boys golf individual state champion and the top-ranked golfer in the Class of 2026, will make his PGA Tour debut in South Carolina on a sponsor exemption.\n\nThe Myrtle Beach Classic is a new PGA Tour event being played alongside the Tour's main tournament this week, the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"For this to be a reality is absurd,\" Brown said. \"But I'm just treating it like any tournament. It's a PGA Tour event, yeah, and not many 16-year-olds can say (they've played in one.) But I'm just going into the event trusting my game and overall trying to have some fun as well.\"\n\nNotable names in the Myrtle Beach Classic include former Vanderbilt and Montgomery Bell Academy star Brandt Snedeker, a nine-time PGA Tour winner, plus Billy Horschel, Beau Hossler, Daniel Berger and Kevin Kisner.\n\nBrown is ranked No. 4 in the AJGA rankings and No. 176 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking. He made national headlines in August when he broke Bobby Jones' record as the youngest medalist in U.S. Amateur history, tying for first place in the tournament's stroke play portion. Brown was eliminated in the match play portion in the Round of 32.\n\nHe joins pro golf's recent trend of teenage phenoms playing PGA Tour sponsored events. England's Kris Kim, 16, debuted at The CJ Cup Byron Nelson last week. Miles Russell, 15, tied for 20th at the Korn Ferry Tour's Lecom Suncoast Classic last month.\n\nBrown and Russell talked before the tournament about what professional competition is like.\n\nThe course conditions at The Dunes Golf and Beach Club are windy, Brown said, but the soft greens might offer more scoring opportunities.\n\n\"I think a solid goal would be to make the cut. I think that would be really cool, to be able to compete on the weekend,\" he said.\n\nBrown isn't nervous and neither is his dad.\n\n\"There's no expectations on Blades,\" said Parke Brown, who is feeling much improved after finishing chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia last summer. \"His game is so solid. I don't worry about him. I know he'll do well. Just being here and competing is a victory.\"\n\nWho is Blades Brown? NIL deals, what to know about 16-year-old making PGA Tour debut this week\n\nBrown, a sophomore at Brentwood Academy, hit a turning point in his career by breaking golf legend Jones' record as the youngest medalist in U.S. Amateur championship history.\n\nJones set the U.S. Amateur record at 18 years old. The mark had stood since 1920.\n\nBrown shot an 8-under 64 to tie the Colorado Golf Club course record and finish as co-medalist. He finished higher than numerous college stars, including Caleb Surratt, the former Tennessee star who left college in February to join the LIV Tour.\n\nBrown's performance was the starting point for sponsor exemption into the Myrtle Beach Classic, as well as financial opportunities. He is being represented by Sportfive sports marketing agency and has NIL deals with Callaway and New Jersey-based Transcend Capital Advisors.\n\nTranscend also has an NIL golf partnership with Virginia star Benjamin James, who is No. 5 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, and previously had a deal with Surratt before he went pro.\n\n\"Luckily with golf, as soon as one door opens, 50 doors open,\" Brown said. \"I'm so thankful and blessed to be given these opportunities. I like to view this as not a challenge but an opportunity to display the talent God's given me.\"", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [],

Followed by Daniel Berger sitting with odds of +2200, and Kevin Yu currently listed at +2500.\n\nOption 1: Daniel Berger (+2200)\n\nBerger should have a great chance to get back in the winner's circle this week. He played well at the CJ CUP last week finishing in a T-13. Berger was under par in all four rounds last week and I expect him to go very low this week.\n\nOption 2: Erik Van Rooyen (+2800)\n\nVan Rooyen has had six top 25 finishes this year in some strong fields, I fully expect him to have a strong showing this week. He has been strong tee-to green thus far this season, if he can putt well he should have a chance come Sunday.\n\nOption 3: Alejandro Tosti (+4000)\n\nTosti didn't play great last week as he missed the cut at the CJ Cup, however he should have a good chance on this golf course. He can hit the ball a mile ranking inside the top-10 in driving distance.

While he has a top-five finish to his name, he has also missed the cut in six of the 11 events he has played in. Last week's tournament in Texas was the latest in that group, a tournament where low scores across the field made it, in Fox's words, \"a putting competition\" and he fell four shots short of the six-under-par cut line.\n\nThis week, an opposite-field week on the PGA Tour where the tour's top players contest one tournament and lower-ranked players contest another event, Fox will be among the latter as he lines up at the Myrtle Beach Classic in South Carolina.\n\n\"Obviously I'd like to be at the other one playing for US$20 million at the Wells Fargo [Championship]. That's a golf course I've played well before at, but it is an opportunity this week,\" Fox told the Herald.\n\n\"It's a bit of a weaker field than what we've had, we've got a really good golf course in Myrtle Beach this week; I think everyone was surprised.\n\n\"It's the first time they've had a tour stop here and no one really knew what to think. I was certainly pleasantly surprised when I played it on Tuesday that there's a lot of really good golf holes; it's in really good condition as well.\"\n\nRanked at No 61 on the official golf world rankings, Fox goes into Myrtle Beach, with US$4m up for grabs, as the highest-ranked player in the field. By FedEx Cup ranking, which only accounts for the golfer's performance on the PGA Tour in the calendar year, he ranks at No 52 in the 132-strong lineup.\n\nHe'll still be keeping an eye on what's going on over at the Wells Fargo, though, with the PGA Championship looming next week.\n\n\"I mean, those are the fields that you want to play in, so it's always nice to keep an eye on what everyone's doing. I've still got a couple of chances to play my way into the signature events this year and that's what I'll be trying to do for the rest of the year.\"\n\nThe Dunes Golf and Beach Club offers plenty of scoring opportunities this week, however the constant presence of water, as well as lurking bunkers around the green mean it is a course where a lack of control and accuracy will be punished.\n\n\"It's going to be a pretty strong test of golf actually, which is probably the opposite of what you'd normally expect in an opposite-field event,\" Fox said.\n\n\"It's a pretty resorty course and it's going to be low scoring, but there's going to be some wind this week. It's right on the beach and there's a fair bit of trouble around and it's a relatively strong golf course; got some length on it as well, so I'm looking forward to the test.\n\n\"The fairway bunkers aren't too bad, there's a fair bit of water off the tee and around a couple of the greens, but the greenside bunkers are really nasty; really deep and the greens are sneaky slopey as well. They're going to be able to trick it up this week, whether they do it or not I'm not sure with the wind. It's just a really good golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_reive@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Christopher Reive", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/OW3QYJFDSNFPDBG5CCS6Y2LDEM.jpg?auth=b075c07c4913ba88376165c67da546c86207cd60c3b1164f5f69e3c59237366a&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546699", "eventUri": "eng-9546699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nFor the second straight week, a teenager has made their PGA Tour debut.\n\nLike 16-year-old Kris Kim at last week's CJ Cup Byron Nelson, Blades Brown is teeing up at this week's Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nBrown, who became the youngest stroke-play medalist in U.S. Amateur history last year, opened with a 1-over 72 on Thursday.\n\n\"Oh, my goodness, it was so much fun,\" Brown said after his round.\n\n\"This course has some teeth to it. I'm not 100 percent used to that yet, but I feel like the experience I'm getting this week is -- like you can't pay for this.\"\n\nThe Dunes Golf and Beach Club is hosting this Opposite Field event, held the same week as the Wells Fargo Championship, the Signature Event that now features an elite 68-player field thanks to Hideki Matsuyama's withdrawal.\n\nThat should not take away from the talent within the Myrtle Beach field, which includes Ryder Cup star Robert MacIntyre, Joel Dahmen, and Beau Hossler, who leads at 7-under after round one.\n\n\"I was so pumped to hear that I was playing in a PGA Tour event,\" Brown added.\n\n\"The nerves didn't really set in until I got here. I started seeing all the grandstands and everything. But then I started to get settled in, hit a few balls, muscle memory started to take over, and I can't thank the Myrtle Beach Classic for giving me this opportunity.\"\n\nBrown admitted to having some nerves over the first couple of holes, and who could blame him? He has never competed on a stage like this before.\n\n\"First tee, I was shaking a little bit, but I decided to -- instead of thinking about it as nervousness, think about it as excitement,\" Brown said.\n\n\"But yeah, it was a lot of fun... I'd say about hole three or so is when I got going.\"\n\nThe 16-year-old opened with five straight pars before sticking it to nine feet on the par-3 6th, where he made his first birdie. But his first PGA Tour round was defined by a mix of birdies and bogies, teetering on the brink of par throughout the round.\n\nIn all, he made five birdies to six bogies -- two of which came on the 17th and 18th holes, a disappointing finish to a dream-fulfilling day.\n\n\"This course is hard,\" Brown assessed.\n\n\"I [need to] tighten it up around the edges, but overall, I feel solid about my game. It's really close, but I'm excited for [Friday's second round].\"\n\nHe will need to go low to follow Kim's lead and become the second teenager in as many weeks to make a cut on the PGA Tour. But Brown has an idea of what he needs to do on Friday.\n\n\"Just course management, stuff like that,\" Brown added.\n\n\"My job is just to hit the ball straight, and you can't learn enough from hanging around these guys. Smack talk, as well. That's there, too. But just where to hit it off the tee and where to hit it on the greens... I just need to tighten up on a few things, but I feel like this is where I belong.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Dahmen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Dahmen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Hossler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beau Hossler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhcUHl6fst9Bv0Sg6_0FB-9K1Vg=/0x0:2620x1310/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440858/2152197016.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546699", "eventUri": "eng-9546699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

His best finish (that came amid those missed cuts) is a T-8 in the team event, the Zurich Classic.\n\nBut he's not giving up and we won't either.\n\nHe only has one PGA Tour win and that was also an off-field event as he won the 2014 Puerto Rico Open.\n\nThat's a 10-year lapse and we figure it's a great time to get back in the winner's circle.\n\nRelated: Wells Fargo Championship odds, props, predictions\n\nWe're going to look at the winner not being in the final group at +175.\n\nIt's simple: Not many of these guys will have been atop the leaderboard of a PGA Tour event come Sunday.\n\nAdd in all the pressure of trying to hold onto a lead and that can certainly cause the palms to be a little sweatier and the collar to be a little tighter.\n\nIt's not the biggest bet around by a mile but we're going to take Van Rooyen to be the top African player at +125.\n\nNot a great number but it's one of those bets that stands out.

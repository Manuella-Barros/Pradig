The development comes three years after the civil rights organization filed federal complaints on behalf of students who said Carroll officials failed to protect them from harassment.\n\nFor more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe four students, all of whom have either graduated or left the district, reported to the Education Department that they had been subjected to a barrage of racist and homophobic slurs and comments during their years at Carroll. One student said he suffered retaliation after reporting racial harassment to administrators. Another said he contemplated suicide after classmates repeatedly mocked him for his sexual orientation; his family said the district failed to address the bullying.\n\nOn Monday, the Education Department notified the NAACP Legal Defense Fund that it had contacted Carroll district officials to begin negotiating a resolution agreement in the four complaints -- a step the agency takes only after finding that students' civil rights have been violated, said Katrina Feldkamp, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nThe Southlake school system -- which became the focus of national headlines in 2021 after conservative parents rejected a sweeping plan aimed at preventing discrimination -- will now have 90 days to reach an agreement with the Education Department on steps it will take to address problems identified in the student complaints, experts said.\n\nAngela Jones, a Black mother of a former Carroll student who was among those who complained to the Education Department, said she spent years advocating for changes to protect minority students in the affluent North Texas school district. But she was rebuffed by school board members and conservative parents who accused her and others of trying to force a far-left political ideology into classrooms. Jones said she and her family felt validated by the Education Department's finding.\n\n\"They're saying to the district, 'You didn't do it on your own, so we're going to come in and make some recommendations for you to do it differently,'\" Jones said. \"I hope they'll take it seriously, and re-evaluate and negotiate.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Education Department said the agency doesn't comment on pending cases. Carroll Superintendent Lane Ledbetter and the school board's president, Cam Bryan, did not respond to messages requesting comment.\n\nThe local debate over how to address racism in Carroll schools became a national symbol of the battles over race, gender and sexuality that have swept the country and was featured in the 2021 NBC News podcast series \"Southlake.\"\n\nThe town's fight began in 2018, after a viral video of white high school students chanting the N-word spurred dozens of Carroll parents and students to come forward with stories of discrimination. After the outcry, the school board appointed a committee of volunteers, including Jones, to come up with strategies to address the problem. The result of their work, the Cultural Competence Action Plan, called for mandatory diversity training for teachers and students and changes to the student handbook explicitly prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender and sexual orientation, among other changes. Then came the backlash.\n\nAfter the plan was released in the summer of 2020, conservative parents and activists -- outraged at what they depicted as anti-white and anti-American indoctrination -- formed a political action committee called Southlake Families PAC, which promised to defeat the diversity plan and elevate \"Judeo-Christian values\" in the school district. They raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a slate of hard-line conservative candidates, launched attack ads accusing their opponents of being radical leftists and, in November 2021, won majority control of the Carroll school board.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Education Department opened its initial investigations into student complaints. The total number of civil right investigations at the district would eventually grow to eight. The status of the other four open cases is unclear.\n\nThe probes set the stage for a potential conflict between local voters who opposed the diversity plan and federal officials tasked with enforcing federal civil rights laws. Now that the Education Department has initiated the process to negotiate a resolution with the district in four of the complaints, the federal agency could end up requiring Carroll to implement some of the same types of diversity and inclusion programs that Southlake voters have rejected in landslide elections in recent years.\n\nIn a video address to the community after the investigations were announced in 2021, Ledbetter, Carroll's superintendent, said the district would \"absolutely comply\" if the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ordered changes. But some local activists have called on the district to fight back against what they see as federal overreach. They have spread unsubstantiated theories that the federal investigation was launched in retaliation against conservatives opposed to critical race theory.\n\nU.S. Rep. Beth Van Duyne, a Republican whose district includes Southlake, wrote a letter in November 2021 to U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, co-signed by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, expressing fears that the Biden administration was \"weaponizing federal resources to intimidate parents who disagree with the policies of this administration.\"\n\nIn a statement four months later, an Education Department spokesperson said the agency's work is \"in no way retaliatory and OCR serves as a neutral fact-finder with any complaint.\"\n\nIn the years since gaining control of the school board, members backed by Southlake Families PAC have made changes that diversity advocates say have made the district less inclusive. The board voted in 2022 to eliminate language explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation and religion from the student handbook. And this week, the board adopted a resolution opposing the Biden administration's decision to expand Title IX protections to LGBTQ students.\n\nLedbetter and members of the school board did not respond to a question from NBC News about whether it planned to work with the Education Department to reach a voluntary agreement.\n\nW. Scott Lewis, managing partner at TNG, a consulting firm that advises school districts on complying with federal civil rights laws, said that if Carroll fails to reach a voluntary agreement with the Office for Civil Rights on how to address discrimination, the agency could impose changes that Carroll would have to abide by or risk losing federal funding or inviting an investigation by the Department of Justice.\n\nAnother approach that the district could take, Lewis said: Carroll could challenge the Education Department's findings in court. \"That's not typically been very successful,\" Lewis said.\n\nFeldkamp, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney, said her clients have asked the Education Department to require Carroll to implement many of the policies that were included in the Cultural Competence Action Plan, including mandatory diversity training for students and staff members.\n\n\"We need to send a message that we will not tolerate Black and brown students being pushed out of school, that it is unacceptable for racism and homophobia to win the day and that our public schools actually are supposed to be educational institutions where all students can feel supported and can thrive,\" Feldkamp said.\n\nOn Wednesday, two community activist groups that had joined the civil rights complaints -- the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition and Cultural & Racial Equity for Every Dragon -- sent a letter to Carroll officials calling on the district to agree \"to remedies that will address the hostile environment\" and \"fulfill your responsibility to protect all students.\"\n\nRaven Rolle, a 23-year-old Black Carroll graduate and Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition member, said it shouldn't have taken federal investigations for the district to listen to current and former students like herself who've shared stories of harassment.\n\n\"Hopefully it sets a precedent for the kids that are currently there and kids who will be there years from now that these things will never happen again, and if they do, they'll be dealt with appropriately,\" Rolle said.\n\nMia Mariani, a 19-year-old college student living in Pittsburgh, was among the former Carroll students notified this week that the Education Department was taking action in response to her complaint of anti-LGBTQ bullying at Carroll.\n\nMariani, whose story was detailed in the \"Southlake\" podcast, was bombarded by a torrent of vulgar messages from classmates on social media mocking her gender identity during a social studies class in the spring of 2022. After reporting the abuse, she secretly recorded her meeting with the principal, who argued that the boys who'd harassed her \"were just wanting to debate\" politics. After her parents filed a complaint over the school's handling of the situation, senior Carroll administrators investigated and concluded that Mariani's complaint did \"not satisfy the criteria necessary to constitute bullying.\"\n\nNow it appears the Department of Education has found evidence that her rights were violated.\n\nMariani said she was surprised when she got the news Monday. She's worked to move on from her experiences in Southlake, she said, but hopes her case leads to changes for current and future students.\n\n\"Any change for them,\" Mariani said, \"is healing for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_Legal_Defense_and_Educational_Fund", "type":

After her parents filed a complaint over the school's handling of the situation, senior Carroll administrators investigated and concluded that Mariani's complaint did \"not satisfy the criteria necessary to constitute bullying.\"\n\nNow it appears the Department of Education has found evidence that her rights were violated.\n\nMariani said she was surprised when she got the news Monday. She's worked to move on from her experiences in Southlake, she said, but hopes her case leads to changes for current and future students.\n\n\"Any change for them,\" Mariani said, \"is healing for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_Legal_Defense_and_Educational_Fund", "type":

The development comes three years after the civil rights organization filed federal complaints on behalf of students who said Carroll officials failed to protect them from harassment.\n\nThe four students, all of whom have either graduated or left the district, reported to the Education Department that they had been subjected to a barrage of racist and homophobic slurs and comments during their years at Carroll. One student said he suffered retaliation after reporting racial harassment to administrators.

Their federal complaints date back to 2021.\n\nThe Department of Education does not comment on pending investigations. A spokesperson for Carroll ISD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news was first reported by NBC News, which produced a multipart podcast that gave Southlake a national reputation as a symbol for what bitter fights over race, gender and politics look like in schools.\n\nFormer CISD student Raven Rolle said she is grateful that, after three years, \"the egregious civil rights violations students face in Carroll ISD are finally being officially recognized as such.\"\n\n\"We look forward to good-faith negotiations with the school district to finally rectify these injustices and cultivate a climate truly welcoming of all Dragons, regardless of race, gender, religion or sexual identity,\" she said in a statement.\n\nRolle also co- wrote an open letter to Carroll Superintendent Lane Ledbetter on behalf of the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition. She requested updates from the district on whether officials will negotiate with the civil rights office and commit to regularly updating the public on the status of those discussions.\n\nGenerally, when federal investigators determine a school violated someone's civil rights, officials work to negotiate an agreement that can require specific action items for the district, such as increased training or policy revisions.\n\nFederal officials then monitor how those steps are implemented. They can refer a case to the Department of Justice \"in the event of breach.\" Federal funding can be at stake.\n\nThe status of four other civil rights complaints against Carroll ISD is unclear.\n\n-------\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

But said she doesn't trust the school board to negotiate in good faith because of past actions, which include scrapping a district and community effort to craft a cultural competence plan and rolling back other protections for marginalized students.\n\n\"Our district takes pride in bucking the system,\" Jones said.\n\nJones, whose three children were in the Carroll school district, said students repeatedly called her youngest son the n-word and sometimes said \"filthy n-word,\" she said.\n\n\"When my son finally told me about it, it broke my heart. I asked why didn't you tell me this sooner, and he said, I'm tired of it,\" Jones said.\n\nJones said after she complained to the school district, the students who were accused of using racial slurs were disciplined, but Jones said she was not told how the students were punished.\n\n\"If the punishments were severe enough, it should have been shut down, and it wasn't,\" she said. \"We saw the ugliness from the community, but we knew we were right.\"\n\nAfter a video surfaced in 2018 of students chanting the n-word, the community and school board members banded together and demanded an end to the bullying and harassment.\n\n\"When the video came out, everybody was up in arms, and then it just flipped,\" Jones said.\n\nA committee that included residents and school district representatives worked on a draft of a cultural competence plan until pressure from conservative groups, including the Southlake Families PAC, led the district to scrap the plan. Southlake Families was spearheaded by Tim O'Hare, who is now the Tarrant County judge.\n\nMeanwhile, Ingram said he is hoping the district will work with the Department of Education to resolve the complaints.\n\n\"This investigation and the findings is about students going to school and feeling safe and that they belong,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_campbell@star-telegram.com", "name": "Elizabeth Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Civil_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Office for Civil Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southlake,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southlake, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_Legal_Defense_and_Educational_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrant_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tarrant County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/cwqkfg/picture251141129/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/FTW_CarrollISDDiversityplan", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553483", "eventUri": "eng-9553483", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

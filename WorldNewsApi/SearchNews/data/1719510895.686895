{"id": 223709668, "title": "Jonny Evans hopes Man Utd do not sack Erik ten Hag after FA Cup glory", "text": "A poor, injury-hit second season in the hotseat has heaped pressure on the Dutchman and a report on the eve of the game claimed the club had decided to fire him regardless of the result at Wembley. But there was no sign of distraction under the arch as Ten Hag\u2019s side shocked neighbours City, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo scoring in a 2-1 win that sealed FA Cup glory. It is United\u2019s second trophy in as many seasons under the former Ajax boss, yet his future remains in serious doubt as ambitious Ineos head into their first summer in control of football operations. Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel and Kieran McKenna are among those to be linked with a job that veteran defender Evans believes Ten Hag should remain in. Asked how everyone would feel if the United manager left, the 36-year-old defender said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll have to ask everyone that. \u201cI think, on a personal level he\u2019s been amazing for me. I can only thank him for that. I have a good relationship with him, so I hope he stays. \u201cSince I came back in the summer he\u2019s had no problems putting me in and trusting in me. \u201cYou want that from the manager, to show that trust and belief in you. He did that. Like I said, I\u2019ve had 30 games now, so I\u2019m buzzing.\u201d The speculation somewhat took the shine off a win that secured silverware and Europa League qualification. Ten Hag\u2019s name was conspicuous by its absence from United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s statement after the final whistle, with the club now set to complete a review of the season. The Dutchman says he has already given his twopence to the powers that be as part of that process and intends to jet off on holiday on Sunday, having attended the FA Cup afterparty with his players. It was a night to toast a fine end to a bumpy campaign, with the celebrations particularly sweet for academy product Evans. A free agent last summer after being relegated at Leicester, Evans made a return to United that was just as surprising as the impact he managed to have in the team. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI think maybe last pre-season, I didn\u2019t know where it was going to be at, but that\u2019s my 30th appearance this season, so I can\u2019t complain. \u201cObviously, the league position wasn\u2019t great, but to be able to win the FA Cup is incredible.\u201d Asked how the FA Cup win ranked among his career achievements, Evans said: \u201cIncredible. I think the further on your career you get, you realise you cherish it a lot more. \u201cCertainly, I enjoyed that out there today, coming on and seeing out the game and obviously the celebrations afterwards.\u201d It could prove a triumphant final United appearance for Evans, who is out of contract this summer. The defender does not know what lies in store, saying \u201cwe\u2019ll see over the next couple of weeks, see what the club says\u201d. While Evans\u2019 outlook is unclear, there is no doubt that Mainoo and Garnacho will form a key part of the United side for the years to come. The 19-year-old duo shone in the club\u2019s FA Youth Cup triumph two years ago and were basking in the afterglow of goals in an FA Cup win. \u201cTwo academy lads, it\u2019s great,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI thought they were both outstanding today. \u201cOver the course of the season, both of them, I have to say, they worked great. \u201cI think always with young lads \u2013 it\u2019s always been a real part of the history of this football club, bringing young lads in, trusting in the academy lads. \u201cSometimes they repay you and they have done this season \u2013 and especially today.\u201d Now, Evans believes, is a time to build on the Wembley win and bolster the squad. \u201cI think hopefully a bit more consistency in the playing squad,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around football for a long time and know when you\u2019ve got lots of changes, it\u2019s very difficult. \u201cHopefully on the back of today, a bit of belief, winning the FA Cup. \u201cThe new owners have got a big job to do in terms of refreshing the squad, everyone\u2019s aware of that. I think they\u2019ll probably do that.\u201d", "summary": "Northern Ireland\u2019s Jonny Evans hopes Manchester United do not sack Erik ten Hag as the club consider the manager\u2019s future following Saturday\u2019s shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/football/international-football/jonny-evans-hopes-man-utd-do-not-sack-erik-ten-hag-after-fa-cup-glory-4643081", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjU4MmZkMzY2LWY1NGMtNDg3MC05NTRkLWNhNTJjY2M1YTk3MDphOTE5NjFkOC1lYWFmLTQ2ZmQtOWUyNC03MWY2OTA3MjQ3ZWY=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:35:18", "author": "By PA Sport,Pa Sport", "authors": ["By PA Sport", "Pa Sport"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.13}

For roughly a quarter of patients, this treatment can durably prolong survival.\n\nAML is an aggressive and often deadly form of blood cancer that can be difficult to treat. For older adults with AML, the conventional treatment consists of a medication called venetoclax combined with a hypomethylating agent (HMA), also known as VEN-HMA. AML treatment is often intensive and can significantly suppress the immune system and put one at risk of other health complications. As a result, some adults with AML, especially those of advanced older age, may be considered ineligible to receive treatment at all and be recommended to pursue palliative care.\n\n\"Our study reveals that a significant portion of these patients at the extremes of older age still derive benefit from the VEN-HMA regimen -- which is the standard of care for older AML patients and those who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy,\" said Justin Watts, MD, a hematologist at the University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, in Miami, Florida, and the study's corresponding author.\n\n\"While acknowledging it certainly isn't for everyone, we hope our findings encourage health care providers to thoughtfully explore all treatment avenues for elderly patients with AML, rather than prematurely resorting to HMA alone, best supportive care, or hospice care.\"\n\nResearchers sought to understand overall survival and remission rates among octo- and nonagenarians (those 80-90 and older) who received VEN-HMA treatment to determine its effectiveness. They analyzed electronic medical records from 154 patients with AML treated with VEN-HMA for the first time between March of 2015 and April of 2022 across six medical institutions in the United States and Italy. Participants had a median age of 82 (range 80-92) and 69% were male. Seventy-seven percent of patients included in the study were newly diagnosed, 10% had relapsed or refractory AML, and for 14%, disease status was unknown.\n\nSixty-seven percent of patients started treatment with the standard dose and treatment schedule of VEN-HMA, and 72% of the cohort had subsequent modifications of their venetoclax dose or schedule after cycle 1 (e.g., reduction in venetoclax duration). Across the cohort, patients were administered a final median venetoclax dose of 400 mg for 21 days, repeated every 35 days. Patients who demonstrated a response to treatment received a final median venetoclax dose of 200mg of venetoclax for 21 days, in 35-day cycles.\n\nApproximately 20 to 25% of all treated patients experienced prolonged survival, which encompassed roughly 40% of those who responded to treatment. Median overall survival was 8.1 months, and for those who responded to treatment, it was 13.2 months. At just under eight months follow-up, 23% of patients remained in remission, while 20% were still receiving treatment. Death rates within 30 and 60 days of treatment were 8.5% and 17%, respectively, comparable to VIALE-A.\n\nFor patients with newly diagnosed AML without a prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 73% achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRc), a classification given when a patient's leukemia cell counts are undetectable, but blood cell counts have not fully returned to normal levels. For patients who achieved CRc, those who received a final venetoclax duration of 14 days or less per cycle had a better average survival time (median of 24.0 months).\n\nPatients whose cancer cells had a mutation in TP53 -- a protein vital to preventing abnormal cell growth -- exhibited poorer overall survival. Patients with a mutation in the NPM1 protein had very favorable survival, and interestingly, patients with K/NRAS or FLT3-ITD mutations did not have inferior survival compared to those without.\n\nNotably, this treatment regimen can lead to myelosuppression, reducing the bone marrow's ability to produce healthy blood cells and weakening the immune system.

Older patients, especially those over 80, may be more vulnerable to experiencing myelosuppression, and because of this, researchers suggest reducing the dose and duration of treatment for those at increased risk. \"A second major theme here is that treating this patient population requires adjusting the dosage and duration of VEN-HMA,\" explained Dr. Watts. \"Unlike typical adult AML cases, these patients exhibit lower tolerance to Venetoclax, suggesting that they may benefit from a reduced dosage.\"\n\nThis study is limited by its retrospective format. Further, the median follow-up duration was approximately 7.7 months, and researchers acknowledge their data may have been stronger if this was extended.\n\nResearchers said they plan to study the optimal dose and treatment schedule for this population to further enhance health outcomes. They want to explore the relationship between minimal residual disease (MRD) and molecular subtype on venetoclax exposure and ultimately stopping venetoclax in a subset of durably responding patients. Researchers said they are also interested in developing a better understanding of how treatment affects quality of life.\n\n# # #\n\nBlood Neoplasia (www.bloodneoplasia.org) is an online only, open access journal of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the world's largest professional society concerned with the causes and treatment of blood disorders.\n\nBlood Neoplasia\u00ae is a registered trademark of the American Society of Hematology.", "source": {"uri": "eurekalert.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurekAlert!"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetoclax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venetoclax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Standard of care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acute myeloid leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumors_of_the_hematopoietic_and_lymphoid_tissues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Survival rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cohort study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Symptomatic treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronic health record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hematology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Musculoskeletal_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Musculoskeletal Disorders", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert-bluebg_Twitter_601X601.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554994", "eventUri": "eng-9554994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 242, "relevance": 1}

They still respond to treatment.\"\n\n\"The question is how long they will respond to treatment, and what is their survival,\" he continued. \"And about one-quarter of patients had prolonged survival, and those patients in whom there was a response could have quite long survival.\"\n\nThe FDA approved the combination of venetoclax with azacitidine, decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine in 2020 for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in adults ages 75 and older or those unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy. Approval was based on results from the VIALE-A trial, in which median OS increased from 9.6 months with azacitidine plus placebo to 14.7 months with the addition of venetoclax. Patients had a median age of 76 years, and about 60% were 75 or older.\n\nIn explaining the rationale behind the current study, Watts and colleagues noted that while the use of HMAs led to improved outcomes, venetoclax combined with HMAs provide even more of an opportunity for these older patients to increase survival -- \"if they can tolerate it.\"\n\nWhile better tolerated than intensive chemotherapy, venetoclax plus HMAs can cause significant myelosuppression, as well as infectious and other non-infectious complications.\n\n\"The extent to which this may limit its use in a population of extreme advanced age (>80 years) is not known,\" the authors wrote, adding that their study is the first to assess the tolerability and efficacy of the combination in an exclusively octogenarian and nonagenarian population.\n\nWatts and colleagues analyzed electronic medical records for 154 patients with AML treated with venetoclax plus HMAs for the first time from March 2015 to April 2022 across six medical institutions in the U.S. and Italy.\n\nOf the patients included in the study, 77% were newly diagnosed, 10% had relapsed or refractory AML, and disease status was unknown in the remaining 14%. More than half (53%) of patients had European LeukemiaNet 2017 adverse risk AML, 33% had intermediate risk, 8% had favorable risk, and 6% were unknown.\n\nAmong newly diagnosed patients, 56% had newly diagnosed AML without prior myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or other myeloid neoplasm, and 44% had newly diagnosed AML with a history of prior MDS or other myeloid neoplasm.\n\nIn terms of how to dose these patients, \"it does seem a lower dose is OK, even if they receive less venetoclax,\" Watts said. \"You can give them less therapy, because the therapy is very effective, even when we give it in shorter durations.\"\n\nTwo-thirds of patients started treatment with the standard dose and treatment schedule, with 72% subsequently modifying their venetoclax dose or schedule after cycle 1.\n\nAcross the cohort, patients were administered a final median venetoclax dose of 400 mg for 21 days, repeated every 35 days, and those patients who demonstrated a treatment response received a final median venetoclax dose of 200 mg for 21 days in 35-day cycles.\n\nA shorter final venetoclax duration (\u226414 days vs >14 days) was associated with improved OS.\n\nThe median follow-up of 7.7 months was a limitation of the study, the authors acknowledged. However, they also pointed out that the median follow-up was 18.6 months for those still alive at data cutoff, \"which underscores the notable response durability in a subset of patients.\"\n\nIn the entire patient population, the complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRc) rate was 57%, and the complete response (CR) rate was 41%. In patients who had a response assessment, the CRc rate was 63% and the CR rate was 46%.\n\nFor patients with newly diagnosed AML without prior MDS, 73% achieved CR or CRc.\n\nFavorable risk AML, as well as NPM1 and FLT3 mutations were associated with improved response rates, while patients with relapsed/refractory AML, prior MDS, prior HMA use, TP53 mutations, and complex karyotype had lower response rates.\n\n\"And the safety, even in this older patient group who are going to be more frail and have more comorbidity, was quite similar to VIALE-A in terms of 30- and 60-day mortality rates (8.5% and 17%, respectively),\" Watts pointed out. \"So, it is tolerable in most of these patients.\"\n\nTreatment-emergent grade 3-4 anemia occurred in 50% of patients, thrombocytopenia in 48%, neutropenia in 53%, and neutropenic fever in 46%. Mortality was attributed to progression/relapse in 60% of cases.\n\nWatts and colleagues said further research is needed to define subsets of patients more likely to durably respond (such as those with NPM1, IDH1/2, and RUNX1 mutations) versus those who might benefit from less venetoclax exposure (those with TP53 mutations and prior MDS), in order to better determine how intensively to treat octogenarians and nonagenarians with venetoclax and HMAs.", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MedPage Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetoclax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venetoclax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acute myeloid leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azacitidine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Azacitidine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remission (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cytarabine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decitabine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Decitabine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myelodysplastic syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Survival rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone marrow suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://assets.medpagetoday.net/media/images/110xxx/110059.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554994", "eventUri": "eng-9554994", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-03-", "textStart": 2591, "textEnd": 2601}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

The discovery, published in the journal Cancer Cell, could soon lead to clinical trials, providing hope for the 1100 Australians diagnosed with AML annually.\n\nResearchers at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) paired venetoclax, a current standard-of-care anticancer drug for AML, with a STING agonist, an emerging class of immunotherapy drug. This marks the first time that a STING agonist has been used to directly target mechanisms within the cancer cells themselves, stimulating the natural processes that cause these cells to die.\n\nUntil now, STING agonist immunotherapy drugs have been chiefly used to attack solid tumours by activating the body's immune response. But the new research indicates that they could be deployed against blood cancers, by directly targeting the cancer cells intrinsically.\n\nThe WEHI team examined samples from a range of different blood cancers, including AML, and treated them in the lab with the drug combination. As explained by co-senior author Associate Professor Gemma Kelly, a laboratory head in WEHI's Blood Cells and Blood Cancer division, both venetoclax and the STING agonists played complementary roles in killing the cancer at the cellular level.\n\n\"Within a cancer cell, venetoclax blocks the machinery of the cell that is keeping it alive,\" Kelly said. \"In certain blood cancers where this response is suboptimal, STING agonists can supercharge this effect to deliver cancer a deathly blow.\n\n\"This is the one-two punch combo that could be the knockout blow for AML,\" added co-first author Dr Sarah Diepstraten. \"You could almost paraphrase the famous boxer Muhammed Ali and say this treatment floats like a butterfly and STINGs like a bee.\"\n\nCritically, the combination treatment showed promise in AML that was driven by a mutated p53 protein, which is generally more aggressive and harder to treat. The p53 protein is supposed to prevent the formation of cancerous cells by enforcing the death, or arresting the growth, of cells that have become damaged or abnormal -- but when the protein is mutated and becomes defective in groups of cells, it can significantly boost a person's risk of developing cancer.\n\n\"For AML patients that do not have as much therapy-induced death of their leukaemia cells due to this mutated protein, combining venetoclax with a STING agonist causes more killing of AML cells than treating with venetoclax alone,\" Diepstraten said.\n\n\"The treatment was highly effective at killing cancer cells in samples with and without the p53 mutation, which is exciting given the lack of effective treatments for aggressive cancers driven by mutations in p53.\"\n\nWEHI lab head Professor Andrew Wei, co-senior author on the study, said that while further research is needed, the findings are highly promising.\n\n\"While early clinical trials in solid cancers have suggested STING agonists are well tolerated in the body, these results offer exciting new hope for patients with the most resistant forms of leukaemia,\" Wei said.\n\n\"Given STING agonists are currently in clinical trials, we hope to conduct human studies using STING agonists in combination with venetoclax in the near future.\n\n\"The research findings ... will inspire a completely new clinical approach for patients affected by the most resistant and deadly forms of acute leukaemia.\"\n\nWEHI is now translating these findings into a new clinical trial in AML patients in collaboration with Aculeus Therapeutics, a local biotechnology company which has spent the last several years developing a potent STING agonist. The proprietary drug, dubbed ACU-0943, is expected to enter clinical development for the treatment of AML later this year.", "source": {"uri": "labonline.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "labonline.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEHI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WEHI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetoclax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Venetoclax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_myeloid_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acute myeloid leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumors_of_the_hematopoietic_and_lymphoid_tissues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immunotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TP53", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TP53"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neoplasm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gene knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acute leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leukemia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://d1v1e13ebw3o15.cloudfront.net/data/82755/pool_and_spa_master/..jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554994", "eventUri": "eng-9554994", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

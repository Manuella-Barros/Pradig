He said the only response so far are the police who were already assigned to maintain order. BPD Sgt. Det. John Boyle later confirmed that three people, two women and a man, were arrested at the event. All will likely be charged with disturbing the peace while one of them will also be charged with assault and battery on a police officer. Boyle said that person threw a water bottle full of water at the officer. The context of the situation was not immediately clear at the situation on Berkeley Street. The arrestees had still not been booked by 1 p.m. Boston Pride for the People includes three distinct events: a parade that lasts from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., a festival on Boston Common scheduled for noon through 6 p.m. and a block party at City Hall from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. \u201cWe have over 300 contingents signed up to march, with nearly 15,000 people celebrating in their own way from Copley Square through the South End, before spilling into the festival at Boston Common. They come from all walks of life: community organizations, youth agencies, schools, small businesses, faith institutions, big companies, advocacy groups, individuals and many others,\u201d organizers wrote on the event website. \u201cThe beauty of how we live our truth as LGBTQ+ people will be on full display \u2013 In Living Color.\u201d The parade started at Clarendon Street and continued onto Tremont Street and then to Berkeley Street, Boylston Street and then onto Charles Street.

Nadal, who is a 14-time French Open champion, lost to No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 on Monday.\n\nIn a match that lasted just over three hours, Zverev was victorious in what could be Nadal's final appearance at Roland Garros. Following the match, Nadal left the clay courts and received a rousing ovation from the fans in attendance.\n\n\"As I said, it's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand,\" Nadal said following Monday's loss.\n\nSome of the sport's biggest stars -- including Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek -- were looking on as Nadal exited the court for perhaps the final time.\n\nNadal came into this year's French Open unseeded after battling through injuries in recent years. On the other hand, Zverev entered the Grand Slam tournament after recently winning the Italian Open, and he is likely viewed as one of the favorites to win the French Open.\n\nDefeating Nadal is quite a remarkable feat as Zverev becomes just the third player to beat Nadal in the French Open. Djokovic and Robin Soderling are the only other players who took down Nadal on the clay courts of Roland Garros.\n\nIf this was Nadal's final match at the French Open, he would finish with a 112-4 career record at the Grand Slam tournament.

AP\n\nIn what could be his last French Open, 14-times champion Rafael Nadal faces a tough task to avoid it all ending in a first-round exit when he plays Alexander Zverev on Monday. Nadal had already announced that this could be the final season of his career but on his arrival in Paris the Spaniard said he could not yet be sure that he was ready to close the door on Roland Garros.\n\nAfter missing last year's tournament through injury, Nadal will be keen to make the most of his return, as will his fans, but standing in his way is fourth-seeded German Zverev, fresh from his triumph at the Italian Open.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories.\n\nZverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nWorld number two Sinner makes his return to action after sitting out the Italian Open following a hip injury at the Madrid Open, and takes on American Christopher Eubanks.\n\nIga Swiatek begins her title defence against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean, and the Polish world number one comes to Paris on the back of title wins in Madrid and Rome.\n\nAmerican third seed Coco Gauff plays 21-year-old qualifier Julia Avdeeva, with the Russian making her Grand Slam debut.\n\nWhat time will Nadal vs Zverev match start at the French Open 2024?\n\nThe first-round French Open 2024 match between Nadal and Zverev is scheduled to start at 6 pm on Monday (27 May).\n\nWhere will the Nadal vs Zverev match be played?\n\nThe Nadal vs Zverev match will be played on Court Philippe-Chatrier in the Stade de Roland Garros in Paris.\n\nWhere can I watch Nadal vs Zverev at the French Open 2024 online in India?\n\nThe live streaming of the Nadal vs Zverev match will be

AP\n\nRafael Nadal's illustrious French Open career came to a likely end with his first ever defeat in the opening round by Alexander Zverev on Monday, after Iga Swiatek made a winning start in her bid for a fourth title.\n\nNadal matched world number four Zverev for long periods on a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, but slipped to a 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 loss as he was beaten for just the fourth time in 116 matches at the tournament.\n\nThis year's event was expected to be the 14-time champion's farewell to Roland Garros, but he had since insisted he could not confirm \"100 per cent\" it would be his last appearance.\n\n\"If it is (the last time), then you have been amazing,\" Nadal told an adoring crowd under the Chatrier roof.\n\n\"The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon.\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nRafael Nadal reacts as he plays against Alexander Zverev at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, on Monday. AP\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev's fast start\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nRafael Nadal (right) checks hands with the winner Alexander Zverev at the Roland Garros Complex in Paris. AFP\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe

This number is set to become 12 next month, as he is likely to skip Wimbledon, where he was the champion in 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now,\" Nadal concluded.\n\nAlexander Zverev expressed that it had been \"a great honour\" to play Rafael Nadal 11 times in their careers.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a rematch of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev withdrew due to ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be reeled back in both times by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke Nadal's serve six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" echoed loudly under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier, shut tight against the torrential rain wreaking havoc on the schedule.\n\nThe cheers subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game, regretting his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but lost the opener after 50 minutes, burying a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't consolidate the advantage, handing the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tiebreak followed, claimed by the German who stretched to 5/3 after a grueling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep, breaking and holding for 2-0 in the third set, with Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek watching from the packed stands.\n\nHowever, Zverev roared back to level at 2-2, putting immense pressure on Nadal. In a grueling 13-minute fifth game, Nadal had to save four break points to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort proved too much, and a composed Zverev soon moved ahead 4-3. The match concluded when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01hyyw2rk74grnx40d6m8d9eye/whatsapp-image-2024-05-27-at-20-55-16.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 464, "textEnd": 470}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal reacts as he plays against Germany's Alexander Zverev during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Monday, May 27, 2024. (Jean-Francois Badias / AP Photo)\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-metre) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 m.p.h. (187 km/h) ace and a 117 m.p.h. (188 km/h) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal leaves the court after losing against Germany's Alexander Zverev at the 2024 French Open. (Thibault Camus/AP Photo)\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nALSO READ: Nadal defeated in likely French Open farewell\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July.\n\nNadal, an Olympic singles gold medallist in Beijing in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: \"That's my main goal now.\n\n\"I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\"\n\nHe won't make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nALSO READ: Nadal puts return on ice, admits 'not ready to compete'\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury.\n\nIn his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\n- 'Thank you Rafa' -\n\nZverev said it had been \"a great honour\" to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nALSO READ: Fans' tears flow as 'legend' Nadal bows out at French Open\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "thesun.my"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon.\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nRafael Nadal reacts as he plays against Alexander Zverev at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, on Monday. AP\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev's fast start\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nRafael Nadal (right) checks hands with the winner Alexander Zverev at the Roland Garros Complex in Paris. AFP\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.", "source": {"uri": "gulftoday.ae",

He isn't sure whether he will ever contend for another one.\n\nNadal was knocked out of the 2024 French Open after drawing a first-round matchup against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. Nadal fought hard at his first major tournament match since the 2023 Australian Open, but Zverev still got the best of him, sweeping him in three sets 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday.\n\nAfter the match, the 38-year-old Nadal opened up about his future and whether he would continue his career and vie for another French Open appearance.\n\nHere's what you should know about what may have been Nadal's final French Open match.\n\nFARRELL: Who is the GOAT of men's tennis? Where Nadal ranks among best ever\n\nNadal acknowledged his loss to Zverev may be his last match at the French Open, but it sounded like he's hopeful it won't be.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future now,\" Nadal told the crowd in a post-match interview. \"[There] is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland Garros, but I can't say 100 percent.\"\n\nNadal outlined that he still has some things he wants to accomplish during his tennis career. That includes a particular goal he hopes to accomplish during the summer.\n\n\"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics,\" Nadal told the crowd. \"That motivates me. That's going to be another chance, and I really hope to be well prepared.\"\n\nThe 2024 Olympics are being held in Paris, so that could give Nadal a chance to make a final, positive memory on the court at Roland Garros. He may want to participate in singles competition, but he could consider teaming up with his countryman -- World No. 3 tennis player Carlos Alcaraz -- to try to take home a gold medal in the doubles as well.\n\nAll that's to say that it doesn't seem like Nadal is ready to retire. He just knows that the end of his career is near and he may never make it back to the French Open at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The feelings that you made me feel here are just unforgettable now,\" Nadal said. \"Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

The King of Clay has been talking up the chances of him bidding goodbye to the sport at the end of the 2024 season after having missed the major part of last year due to his long-standing hip injury. Nadal has been handed a brutal draw as the unseeded superstar will face an in-form Alexander Zverev in his men's singles first round at the iconic Philippe-Chatrier Arena on Monday, May 27.\n\nRafael Nadal will take on Alexander Zverev in the afternoon in Paris on Monday with their much-anticipated big-ticket clash scheduled as the third fixture on the centre court. Before Nadal vs Zverev, two women's singles matches involving 8th seed Ons Jabeur and top seed Iga Swiatek.\n\nThe stands at the Phillipe-Chatrier will be packed to the rafters and most of the fans will be rooting for the greatest man to have ever played on the red dirt of Paris - Nadal. For probably the first time in his decorated run in Paris, Nadal will not start the match as a favourite. Zverev is heading into the Roland Garros after having won the Masters 1000 title in Rome to send a warning notice to the rest of the field.\n\nThe first-round match between Nadal and Zverev at the French Open will not start before 7 pm on Monday, January 26.\n\nSonyLiv will provide the live streaming of the big-ticket match in India.\n\nSony Sports Network will provide live TV coverage of the match in India.\n\nNadal has won seven of their 11 meetings in French Open 2024. Nadal and Zverev last played in 2022 - in the French Open semi-final.\n\nIncidentally, Zverev's career came to a halt when he injured his ankle and crashed out in the semi-final against Nadal in Roland Garros in 2022. The German has hit form since returning from the break and his performance in the clay-court Grand Slam has always been impressive. In fact, Zverev has reached the semi-final in Paris for three successive years.\n\nDespite the odds in favour of Zverev, not many are going to rule Nadal out of the contest. The Spaniard has had a lean run on clay, having lost 3 out of the 8 matches he has played. He was ousted in the second round of Rome last week by Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nFans are also fearing that 2024 will be the last time Nadal will play the Roland Garros. However, the Spaniard hinted on Saturday that he might return for his favourite Grand Slam next year, in a big deviation from his statements earlier in the year. Nadal is also expected to play the Olympics later in July-August in his favourite city - Paris.\n\nNadal did not raise expectations, acknowledging that his first-round match against Zverev will not be easy.\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"But in my mind is something different, play much better and give myself a chance to be competitive... I didn't play this level of opponents, being competitive for a super long time.\n\n\"So all these questions I understand that you're making to me I'm asking to myself too. But the answer is going to be on Monday, no? That's it. The rest of the things are just talking and talking, and in the end don't matter. It's about my feelings and my feelings are better. I want to enjoy that match.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SonyLIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SonyLIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/alexander-zverev-and-rafael-nadal-230531147-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=QnbOHWS8RzCgyprioNsPfwJl70yc4Jz5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 570, "textEnd": 576}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-26", "textStart": 1393, "textEnd": 1403}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The tournament concludes on Sunday, June 9, 2024 (6/9/24).\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out \" Ra-fa! Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\n\"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\"\n\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words.

That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics in the city in July.\n\n\"I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100% keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\n- 'Thank you Rafa' -\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour,\" said Zverev.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court.

Five previous meetings between Nadal and Zverev", "body": "The 14-time Roland Garros champion has only played four tournaments since January 2023 due to injuries but holds a 7-3 winning record over Zverev\n\nRafael Nadal faces Alexander Zverev on Monday as he opens what is likely to be his final French Open campaign with a tough assignment against the world number four. The 14-time Roland Garros champion has only played four tournaments since January 2023 due to injuries but holds a 7-3 winning record over Zverev. Mid-Day takes a look at five previous meetings between Nadal and Zverev ahead of their French Open encounter:\n\n2016 Indian Wells last 16 Nadal 6-7 (8/10), 6-0 7-5 -- A teenage Zverev enjoyed a breakthrough tournament at Indian Wells, knocking out seeds Grigor Dimitrov and Gilles Simon to reach the fourth round of a Masters event for the first time. The German made a mark in his maiden match against Nadal, saving two set points before taking the first set in a tie-break. Nadal fought back to force a decider, but Zverev created the chance to serve for victory when leading 5-3, only to miss a match point and lose five straight games as he tumbled to defeat.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n2017 Australian Open 3rd rd Nadal 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-2 -- The pair's second meeting was their first at a Grand Slam tournament. Zverev took control of the match early on, building a two-sets-to-one lead. But again Nadal battled back in trademark fashion, eventually securing victory after more than four hours on court. Nadal went on to lose a memorable final against Roger Federer.\n\nAlso Read: Age barrier for Rafael Nadal? Not quite! Here's three 40-something trailblazers\n\n2018 Rome Open final Nadal 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 -- Zverev's first defence of a Masters 1000 title was a strong one in Rome six years ago, as he set up his only meeting with Nadal in a final to date. The Spaniard, though, was too strong for his young rival once more, clinching his eighth of 10 Rome triumphs with his fifth win against Zverev in as many matches.\n\n2019 ATP Finals round robin Zverev 6-2, 6-4 -- Zverev finally got the better of Nadal at the 2019 season-ending Finals in London during the group phase. The German dominated on the indoor hard court and eventually finished second in the group ahead of Nadal on set difference. But Zverev's title defence ended in the semi-finals with defeat by Dominic Thiem.\n\n2022 French Open semi-finals Nadal 7-6 (10/8), 6-6 -- retired -- Nadal and Zverev's most recent meeting was their most memorable. Ahead of the second time they had played each other at a Grand Slam and the first time in the second week, Zverev had high hopes of becoming only the third player to ever defeat Nadal at Roland Garros. Nadal won a marathon first set after Zverev blew a 6-2 lead in the tie-break. After more than three hours on court, Zverev suffered a nasty ankle injury while hitting a forehand wide which levelled the second set at 6-6, leaving the court in a wheelchair before confirming he could not continue. Nadal beat Casper Ruud in the final to win his 14th French Open. Zverev did not play again in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigor_Dimitrov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grigor Dimitrov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Simon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gilles Simon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2018 Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ATP_Finals_\u2013_Singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 ATP Finals \u2013 Singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Round-robin tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/zvrrnad_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev",

A 15th win proved far out of reach Monday: He lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev.\n\nThe 3-6, 6-7, 3-6 loss for Nadal, who has been struggling with hip and abdominal injuries, came as the crowd in Paris cheered him on with chants of \"Ra-fa!\"\n\nIn a rare post-defeat interview on the court, the 22-time Grand Slam champion said that while he wasn't 100% sure that this would be his final French Open, \"if it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\"\n\n\"The crowd have been amazing,\" the Spanish player said. \"The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.\"\n\nHe added that while it would be \"difficult\" to play on the grass courts at Wimbledon this summer, he was hopeful about coming back to Roland Garros' clay courts for the Olympics.\n\n\"That motivates me.

(AFP) Rafael Nadal's record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising defeat against Alexander Zverev before he revealed his journey to the Paris Olympics in July will not take a detour to Wimbledon.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the first round to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport.\n\n\"I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you,\" he said. \"If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July. Nadal, an Olympic singles gold medallist in Beijing in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: \"That's my main goal now. I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\"\n\nHe won't make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners. Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury.\n\nIn his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010. \"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said. \"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nZverev said it had been \"a great honour\" to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers. \"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34. Chants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.

The German star claimed a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory in the first round to knock out Nadal. Notably, Zverev has become only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. The latter bids adieu after claiming 14 Roland Garros title.\n\nZverev won a total of 112 points and 44 winners throughout the match. He served eight aces compared to Zverev's two. The German had a win percentage of 58 and 48 in the first and second serves, respectively. Nadal won 19 of his 21 net points. Both Nadal and Zverev recorded 30 unforced errors. They registered three double-faults each.\n\nBefore this match, Nadal had only lost to Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic at the French Open. Soderling defeated him in the fourth round in 2009, while Djokovic remains the only player to defeat Nadal twice in the tournament (quarter-finals, 2015 and semi-finals, 2021). Between 2015 and 2021, Nadal was unbeaten in as many as 35 matches at the French Open.\n\nNadal now has a win-loss record of 112-4 at Roland Garros. He has been knocked out for the first time before the fourth round. Notably, the Spaniard also holds the record for winning 39 consecutive French Open matches. It is worth noting that Nadal won four French Open titles without losing a set (2008, 2010, 2017, and 2020), the most for a player.\n\nNearly two decades after winning his maiden Grand Slam title, Nadal owns a total of 14 French Open honors (2005-2008, 2010-2014, 2017-2020, and 2022). The Spaniard has won eight more Roland Garros titles than Bjorn Borg, who owns six titles (second-most). Nadal also holds the record for winning most titles at a Grand Slam and on a single surface (clay).", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l37920240527215831.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Ra-fa!\" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-6 Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph ace and a 117 mph service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-2. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\n\"Ra-fa!

The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year.

When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [],

If it is I have enjoyed it,\" Nadal said in an on-court speech.\n\n\"The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\"\n\nWith some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament's finest champion.\n\nNadal falls short after tough draw\n\nAnticipation for Nadal's return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion - easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and 'Gracias Rafa' T-shirts - milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened.\n\nAfter a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here.\n\nIn a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\".\n\nPractice is very different to a match, of course, and Nadal knew that. He also knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev.\n\nWith the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made.\n\nZverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-court athlete, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight.\n\nHe reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month.\n\nThe way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites.\n\nZverev's performances at Roland Garros will play out alongside a trial over domestic violence allegations. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany.\n\nHow the match unfolded\n\nAn ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing.\n\nEach mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control before breaking again for the set.\n\nNadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hopes again by moving into a 4-2 second-set lead.\n\nBut as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away.\n\nThe Olympic champion remained composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking.\n\nThe gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal's great rival Djokovic, along with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men's champion Carlos Alcaraz, sitting in the stands to watch.\n\nLike the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front.\n\nNadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev came through in a strong finish.\n\n\"The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,\" said Nadal.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital FM Kenya"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_olobulu@capitalfm.co.ke", "name": "Timothy Olobulu",

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\nThis story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTAJ - www.wtaj.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wtaj.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Open", "body": "Rafael Nadal, 22-time Grand Slam champion, lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in his probable last match at Roland Garros.\n\nRafael Nadal's record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising first-round defeat against Alexander Zverev.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Zverev on Monday, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut.\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport.\n\n\"I don't know if this is the last time I will be here, I am not 100 percent sure but if it is then I wanted to enjoy it,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"The feelings today are difficult to describe in words.\"\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100 percent keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semifinal, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nNadal was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to have his serve broken on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier, which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game, but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set, but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semifinalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [],

Nadal, the 14-time French Open champion, gave his all in what might be his final appearance in the French Open but fell prey to the sharp forehand aggressive play of Alexander Zverev as he lost 3-6, 6-7(4), 3-6 in the blockbuster opening round clash on Monday.\n\nFollowing the game, Nadal hinted at missing the grass surface tournament Wimbledon, which will take place from July 1 onwards, placed between the French Open and the Olympics, the latter starting from July 26 in Paris. \"Looks difficult for me now to make the transition to grass & having the Olympics to play on clay just after. I have to analyse but I do not think it would be smart after all the things that happened to my body,\" Nadal said after the match with Zverev.\n\nNadal, the former World No. 1, suffered a first-round defeat at Roland Garros. This is the first time that he made an exit in the first round. Spectators at the Court Philippe-Chatrier witnessed vintage Nadal moments as he played some of his best tennis, especially with his trademark forehand passing shot in a three-hour-and-five-minute match.\n\nZverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under duress proved to be too much to overcome. Talk among tennis fans of this intriguing matchup - a replay of their Paris semifinal from two years back when they played for almost three hours before Zverev was forced to withdraw due to a terrible ankle injury - began as soon as the draw was announced at Roland Garros.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic all sat in the stands to watch the exciting match. The match was won in straight sets but every time Nadal appeared to have the upper hand and get the boisterous audience behind him, Zverev came up with a countermove to regain the upper hand.\n\nRain forced the match to be played indoors on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Zverev served heavily and hit a sharp forehand to prevent Nadal from establishing the lead in rallies. Zverev started his highly anticipated first-round Roland Garros blockbuster against Rafael Nadal with aggressive play to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nEarly in the second set, Nadal faced two break points and was well behind at the Court Philippe-Chatrier. However, he managed to escape difficulty and invoked his finest tennis memories to secure a service break. The boisterous crowd erupted in applause for the 37-year-old who was all over the court. However, Zverev maintained his composure and responded when Nadal served to tie the game. The German then took a dominating advantage by playing almost the whole tie-break from the lead.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal dug deeper to come out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break. In an attempt to get back into the match, Nadal gave the audience big fistpumps and played some scorching forehand passing shots multiple times during the match. However, the King of Clay suffered his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland Garros.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say. First of all, thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. I don't know what to say. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment, so thank you,\" Zverev said in his on-court interview, as quoted by ATP. On the same court, the two faced off in the semi-finals two years ago. Before the second set had ended, and more than three hours into the match, Zverev sustained a terrible ankle injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the 2022 season. It looked like a duel made to be remembered. Afterwards, Nadal won his fourteenth Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nNadal struggled with a couple of injuries over the past couple of years and had a tally of 5-3 record this clay-court season heading into the French Open 2024. Before this match, the Spaniard had not competed on Court Philippe-Chatrier since winning there in 2022.

That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\n'Thank you Rafa'\n\nZverev said it had been \"a great honour\" to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@gulfnews.com", "name": "Agence

It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\"\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\nNadal, the 22-time Grand Slam champion who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, has previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.\n\nThe seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's No 1 and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd.\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier.\n\nNadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two break points before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tie-break.\n\nNadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.\n\nHis celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, came into the French Open unseeded for the first time and saw his career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament fall to 112-4.\n\nHis three other losses came against Soderling in 2010 and twice against Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\"\n\nItalian world No 2 Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks 6-3 6-3 6-4.\n\nSinner, the Australian Open champion, withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed Rome with a hip injury, but was back on form at Roland Garros as Eubanks exited at the first hurdle for the second successive year.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm glad that my team and myself, we were working very hard to be on court as soon as possible,\" Sinner said. \"For sure, the general shape is not at 100 per cent yet, so we try to build every day.\"\n\nThe Italian broke twice in the opening set to lead 4-1 before Eubanks broke back but Sinner saw out the set with another break, and needed just one break in each of the next two sets to take his place in the second round.\n\n\"Honestly, I'm just happy to be back on court, I was injured, so I'm very happy to be back here,\" Sinner said.\n\n\"It's a very special tournament for me, it was the first time in a quarter-final of a grand slam, so I have some great memories.\"\n\nDjokovic, who returned to the top of the rankings in September, now needs to at least reach the final to have any chance of staying there.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb, who said he has \"low expectations and high hopes\" of defending his title in Paris, faces French wild card Pierre-Hugues Herbert in his first-round match on Tuesday.\n\nIn the run-up to the third Grand Slam of 2024 - Wimbledon - you can watch all of the biggest tennis stars in action live on Sky Sports as they compete across the grass-court

If it is I have enjoyed it,\" Nadal said in an on-court speech.\n\n\"The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\"\n\nWith some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament's finest champion.\n\nAnticipation for Nadal's return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion - easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and 'Gracias Rafa' T-shirts - milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened.\n\nAfter a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here.\n\nIn a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\".\n\nPractice is very different to a match, of course. Nadal knew that and knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev.\n\nWith the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made.\n\nZverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-courter, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight.\n\nHe reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month.\n\nThe way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites.\n\nZverev has insisted a court case over domestic abuse allegations will not distract him. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany.\n\nAn ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing.\n\nEach mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control before breaking again for the set.\n\nNadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hopes again by moving into a 4-2 second-set lead.\n\nBut as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away.\n\nThe Olympic champion remained composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking.\n\nThe gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal's great rival Djokovic, along with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men's champion Carlos Alcaraz, sitting in the stands to watch.\n\nLike the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front.\n\nNadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev came through in a strong finish.\n\n\"The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,\" said Nadal.", "source":

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\n\"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While most sculptures appear static this is a kaleidoscope of movement. Nadal is depicted with left leg in the air, left arm wrapped around his body in a forehand, and mouth open in that primal snarl of effort.\n\nThat is how he will be remembered, not as the man who was beaten in straight sets by Alexander Zverev on Philippe Chatrier. Here was a titan brought down to the level of mortals.\n\nIf this is to be the 37-year-old's last French Open - he once more demurred on the point on Monday night - he will finish with 14 titles and a 112-4 record.\n\nThere were flickers of magic and plenty of fight. It was comfortably Nadal's best performance this year and there was enough to suggest he could have carved out a deep run in Paris, given a kinder draw.\n\nBut Zverev is younger, fitter and more powerful and sometimes sport is as simple as that. The German No4 seed joins Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic as the only men to have beaten Nadal at the French Open.\n\nRafael Nadal's French Open swansong came to an early end after his first-round knockout\n\nNadal went down in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in what may be his final year on tour\n\nNadal was philosophical after the match. 'I showed, to myself, first of all, that I was ready for more than what I did, that is, losing in the first round,' said the Spaniard.\n\n'But that's how it is, no? When you are not seeded, you play against a player who is one of the best in the world.\n\n'I was ready to build my game and confidence day by day. But I never had those days of competition, because I faced a very tough opponent.\n\n'I played a good level, compared to the way I was playing the weeks before. Of course disappointed for losing, but happy that I finished healthy and had a tough battle.\n\n'If it's the last time I played here, I am in peace with myself. The last two years I have gone through the toughest process in my career with the dream to come back here. At least I did. I lost, but that's part of the business.'\n\nNadal did not sound like a man who was ready to retire and we should not even rule out a return to the French Open next year if his body holds up.\n\n'I cannot tell you if I will be (playing) in one month and a half,' he said. 'My body has been a jungle for two years: I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me; another day a tiger. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks.\n\n'It's about not having the feeling in one year that I didn't give myself a chance, a real chance, because immediately that I started to become a little bit more healthy, I stop.'\n\nZverev inflicted only Nadal's fourth French Open defeat and his first ever in the first round\n\nThe legendary Spaniard fought valiantly under the closed roof on Court Philippe Chatrier\n\nThis was perhaps the most anticipated first-round match in tennis history, as evidenced by those in attendance. Nadal was watched from the stands by his greatest rival Novak Djokovic, the heir to his Spanish throne Carlos Alcaraz and his successor as the most dominant player at Roland Garros, Iga Swiatek.\n\nThis was an emotionally significant match for Zverev, too. It was here against Nadal in the 2022 semi-finals when he suffered a horrific ankle injury. The 27-year-old will feel like this win finally laid those ghosts to rest.\n\nZverev looked a little cowed at times by the febrile atmosphere. He was clumsy around the net and wasteful of opportunities but he landed 77 per cent of his first serves and struck 44 winners.\n\nConsidering the occasion, it was a performance worthy of ending the greatest run in tennis history.\n\nIf this is to be his last French Open, what a legacy Nadal leaves. He has dominated this corner of Paris's 16th arrondissement in a manner that is without parallel - not just in tennis but in any sport. His win rate at the French Open is 96.6 per cent.\n\nHe fought Zverev, the No 4 seed, after dropping down the rankings due to infrequent play\n\nAll being well, Nadal will be back on the same court for the Olympics later this summer\n\nHe arrived as a 19-year-old in 2005 and won the title on debut. The hair was longer, the shorts baggier and the sleeves non-existent. He was the kid who could retrieve any ball. But what has taken him from greatness to immortality is his insatiable greed for improvement.\n\nAt the start of his career his serve was little more than a way to get the point started but he reforged it into a powerful weapon. He became more aggressive, and turned himself into perhaps the best volleyer in the world.\n\nAll being well, Nadal will be back on this court for the Olympics, playing the singles and the doubles, with Alcaraz.\n\n'I don't know if it's the last time I will be here,' Nadal told his adoring fans after the match. 'It's so special to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most.\n\n'The feelings you have made me feel are unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_tennis_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Types of tennis match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_arrondissement_of_Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "16th arrondissement of Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "16th arrondissement of Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/27/18/85393537-0-image-m-17_1716830243187.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Zverev made 77 percent of his first serves, saved nine of 11 break points and had 44 winners to 30 unforced errors.\n\nNadal dropped to 112-4 in his French Open career and has now lost back-to-back matches on clay for the first time since he made his ATP Tour match debut in April 2002.\n\nHe entered the French Open with a 5-3 record in clay-court matches this season after missing nearly all of 2023.\n\nNadal could return to Roland Garros to play in the Paris Olympics this summer.

Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam singles champion turns 38 on June 3 and has missed much of the last two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence there since he made his debut as a teenager.\n\nHe is just 7-4 in 2024, and he expressed a bit of doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago -- he called it a \"disaster\" on Saturday -- as to whether he would even enter Roland Garros at all. He is the seventh betting favorite to win the title\n\nBut he did show up and has been training in front of loud, supportive crowds this week. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he is No. 276 currently -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, Day 2 of the tournament. The match is set for 6 a.m. ET.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year; I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he can move more confidently than he has been and gets the sense he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title in Rome and might be a popular pick as the most talented player yet to win a Grand Slam trophy. He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at Roland Garros, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier with a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke.\n\nAnd Zverev -- whose ongoing court case related to accusations of domestic abuse by a former girlfriend will resume with a hearing in his native Germany next week -- said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nNadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship at the 2022 French Open while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023, and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal later this season.\n\nAnd while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out. About a possible return to the French Open. About how much longer he will be on tour.\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Nadal said. \"Maybe in one month and a half, I'll say, 'OK, it's enough. I can't keep going.' But today, in some way, I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/646631cdb0ac4a7e7bc92c25/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 465, "textEnd": 471}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I have to analyse but I do not think it would be smart after all the things that happened to my body,\" Nadal said after the match with Zverev.\n\nNadal, the former World No. 1, suffered a first-round defeat at Roland Garros. This is the first time that he made an exit in the first round.\n\nSpectators at the Court Philippe-Chatrier witnessed vintage Nadal moments as he played some of his best tennis, especially with his trademark forehand passing shot in a three-hour-and-five-minute match.\n\nZverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under duress proved to be too much to overcome. Talk among tennis fans of this intriguing matchup - a replay of their Paris semifinal from two years back when they played for almost three hours before\n\nZverev was forced to withdraw due to a terrible ankle injury - began as soon as the draw was announced at Roland Garros.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic all sat in the stands to watch the exciting match.\n\nThe match was won in straight sets but every time Nadal appeared to have the upper hand and get the boisterous audience behind him, Zverev came up with a countermove to regain the upper hand.\n\nRain forced the match to be played indoors on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Zverev served heavily and hit a sharp forehand to prevent Nadal from establishing the lead in rallies.\n\nZverev started his highly anticipated first-round Roland Garros blockbuster against Rafael Nadal with aggressive play to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nEarly in the second set, Nadal faced two break points and was well behind at the Court Philippe-Chatrier. However, he managed to escape difficulty and invoked his finest tennis memories to secure a service break. The boisterous crowd erupted in applause for the 37-year-old who was all over the court.\n\nHowever, Zverev maintained his composure and responded when Nadal served to tie the game. The German then took a dominating advantage by playing almost the whole tie-break from the lead.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal dug deeper to come out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break.\n\nIn an attempt to get back into the match, Nadal gave the audience big fistpumps and played some scorching forehand passing shots multiple times during the match. However, the King of Clay suffered his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland Garros.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say. First of all, thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. I don't know what to say. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment, so thank you,\" Zverev said in his on-court interview, as quoted by ATP.\n\nOn the same court, the two faced off in the semi-finals two years ago. Before the second set had ended, and more than three hours into the match, Zverev sustained a terrible ankle injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the 2022 season. It looked like a duel made to be remembered. Afterwards, Nadal won his fourteenth Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nNadal struggled with a couple of injuries over the past couple of years and had a tally of 5-3 record this clay-court season heading into the French Open 2024.\n\nBefore this match, the Spaniard had not competed on Court Philippe-Chatrier since winning there in 2022.

But while Nadal used a strong protected ranking to enter the French Open directly, he didn't receive a seeding - which left him in danger of drawing a big-time player - and exactly that happened.\n\nA month ago in Barcelona, Nadal also used a protected ranking to enter the tournament and he received the No. 9 seeding at the Spanish ATP 500 tournament.\n\n\"It makes no sense that someone who has won 14 times is not seeded. It is the way the tournament has always acted. For me it is crazy,\" the American told the media, as quoted by Marca.\n\n\"It is the most interesting first round of a Major that I remember and the most tough [in the] Open Era for someone like Nadal.\"\n\nLeading up to the French Open, Nadal took part in three tournaments and played a total of eight matches - in which he went 5-3. But since Nadal was evidently far from his best game and physically-wise, the hope was that the Spaniard could get an easy French Open draw and then build up his form before potentially taking on a star player.\n\nNow, McEnroe fears how Nadal's body would look in the remainder of the tournament even if he managed to survive a tough Zverev test.\n\n\"He has to do whatever he wants. He loves to compete and if he loses to Zverev it does not mean that all his records at Roland Garros will be lost. Maybe his time has come to be a father and everyone's time has come,\" McEnroe added.\n\n\"Maybe I'm wrong and he'll be able to do something special here. It's a question mark as to how his body will recover as the rounds go by.\n\n\"On the one hand it will be a surprise, and on the other it won't. People like him, Novak or Roger are Superman.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Zverev, McEnroe believes this is a great chance for the German to kick off his French Open campaign in style and ultimately become a Grand Slam champion.\n\n\"[Zverev] has a real chance of winning in Paris if he focuses solely and exclusively on tennis and not on other things off the court. I believe that the 2020 US Open should have been his. Sascha's serve is working better than ever,\" McEnroe added.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference, Nadal honestly admitted that facing Zverev so early in the tournament wasn't something he wanted. But Nadal noted that complaining about it won't get him anywhere and that he just needs to try to focus on preparing for the match as best as he can.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is. I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see,\" Nadal noted.\n\nOn the other side, Zverev made a great revelation when he shared that he thought someone was joking him when told that he was drawn to face Nadal in the French Open first round.\n\nThen, Zverev proceeded to highlight that one of his big wishes was to play Nadal again at the French Open because he felt that way it could help him mentally overcome what happened two years ago when he suffered a horror ankle injury during their semifinal at Roland Garros.\n\n\"I was on court with [Andrey] Rublev yesterday on Chatrier practicing, and then after the practice was over, which was actually a great practice, my brother told me,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I actually thought he was joking in the beginning. But then, yeah, it is what it is. I mean, obviously, to be very honest, I wanted to play Rafa again in my career, in his career, because I didn't want my last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court in a wheelchair.\"\n\nAfter acknowledging his goal was to play at the French Open, Zverev also admitted that he would have still preferred it to have come later in the tournament.\n\nGoing into the match, Nadal owns a 7-3 head-to-head versus Zverev.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McEnroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149202.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

If it is I have enjoyed it,\" Nadal said in an on-court speech.\n\n\"The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\"\n\nWith some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament's finest champion.'\n\nNadal falls short after tough draw\n\nAnticipation for Nadal's return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion - easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and 'Gracias Rafa' T-shirts - milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened.\n\nAfter a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here.\n\nIn a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\".\n\nPractice is very different to a match, of course. Nadal knew that and knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev.\n\nWith the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made.\n\nZverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-courter, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight.\n\nHe reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month.\n\nThe way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites.\n\nZverev has insisted a court case over domestic abuse allegations will not distract him. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany.\n\nIn a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\".\n\nPractice is very different to a match, of course.

Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany.\n\n\\How the match unfolded\n\nAn ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing.\n\nEach mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control before breaking again for the set.\n\nNadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hopes again by moving into a 4-2 second-set lead.\n\nBut as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away.\n\nThe Olympic champion remained composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking.\n\nThe gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal's great rival Djokovic, along with defending women's champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men's champion Carlos Alcaraz, sitting in the stands to watch.\n\nLike the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front.\n\nNadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev came through in a strong finish.\n\n\"The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"But it was not enough against a great player.\"(BBC Sport)", "source": {"uri": "guyanachronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guyana Chronicle"}, "authors": [],

He joked. He sounded upbeat. He's been playing well and feeling better in practice. He is eager to get going at Roland Garros after dealing for so long with hip and abdominal problems.\n\nOh, and then there's this little tidbit he dropped during a pre-tournament news conference Saturday: This French Open might not turn out to be the 14-time champion's last appearance, after all, at his favorite event, one he called \"magical.\"\n\nBecause of his age -- he turns 38 on June 3 -- and his injuries, not to mention past statements about figuring 2024 would be his last year on tour, everyone from other players to fans to the media has been assuming it will be his farewell appearance at the French Open.\n\nAsked whether that's accurate, Nadal grinned and replied: \"Don't assume that.\"\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" Nadal said. \"But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nThe Spaniard missed much of the last two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence there since he made his debut as a teenager. He is just 7-4 in 2024, and he expressed a bit of doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago -- he called it a \"disaster\" on Saturday -- as to whether he would even enter the clay-court tournament in Paris at all.\n\nBut he did show up and has been training in front of loud, supportive crowds this week. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he is No. 276 currently -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, Day 2 of the tournament.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year; I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he can move more confidently than he has been and gets the sense he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title in Rome and might be a popular pick as the most talented player yet to win a Grand Slam trophy. He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at Roland Garros, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier with a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke.\n\nAnd Zverev -- whose ongoing court case related to accusations of domestic abuse by a former girlfriend will resume with a hearing in his native Germany next week -- said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nNadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship at the 2022 French Open while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023, and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal later this season.\n\nAnd while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out.

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon.\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\n- Zverev's fast start -\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki",

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.\"\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics' tennis competition will be held at the French Open's site.\n\nWhen Monday's match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I'm 28,\" Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: \"Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.", "source": {"uri": "accesswdun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Access WDUN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki",

If Sascha can play the man not the legend here, he should win with plenty in hand.\n\n2:26PM\n\nNadal 0-1 Zverev*\n\nNadal is up against is straight away. Zverev aggressive, direct, moving the Spanish veteran around and he's been very dominant there. Before you know it, it's 0-40 and, not that the great man needed telling, but he knows he's in a huge fight. Zverev takes the first of the three break points at his disposal.\n\n2:21PM\n\nNadal in a powder blue\n\nshirt with white shorts, his opponent in a shirt with a yellow front and white back. It's Nadal to serve first.\n\n2:18PM\n\nRoof a factor?\n\nA few boos ring out among the cheers as Alexander Zverev enters the stadium. The closed roof clearly favours Zverev, both because Nadal is the world's best windy-weather player (his heavy spin cuts through the breeze) and because Zverev has arguably the best serve in the game right now, which will only be enhanced by the lack of any wind to disrupt his ball-toss. He is landing a mind-boggling 74 per cent of his first serves this season, and unless Nadal gets in his head, I'd expect that figure to climb above 80 today.\n\n2:17PM\n\nThe great man is out on court\n\nTo a rapturous reception, as you might imagine, and this could be a fantastic occasion. By the way, it's Alan Tyers here to talk you through the action.\n\n2:10PM\n\nThe last dance for Nadal in Paris?\n\nHello and welcome to coverage from the French Open in what could be Rafael Nadal's final match at Roland Garros.\n\nThe 14-time champion begins his campaign against Alexander Zverev, which is the standout match in the first round.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories.\n\nZverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nAny plans to pay tribute to Nadal if he loses have been scuppered because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_tyers@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Alan Tyers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tennis/2024/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000379621561_17168165166730_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqy66hu0TpIy4d7oO0NBM5NTQnC5DCw90YHLKHXFlQeAE.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He joked. He sounded upbeat. He has been playing well and feeling better in practice. He is eager to get going at Roland Garros after dealing for so long with hip and abdominal problems.\n\nOh, and then there's this little tidbit he dropped during a news conference Saturday, just before the start of the second major tennis tournament of the year: This French Open might not turn out to be the 14-time champion's last appearance, after all, at his favorite event, one he called \"magical.\"\n\nBecause of his age -- the Spaniard turns 38 on June 3 -- and his injuries, not to mention his past statements about figuring 2024 would be his last year on the ATP Tour, everyone from fellow players to fans to members of the media have been assuming it will be his farewell appearance at the clay court Grand Slam event.\n\nAsked whether that's accurate, Nadal grinned and replied: \"Don't assume that.\"\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" Nadal said. \"But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nHe missed much of the past two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence in the event since he made his debut as a teenager. He is just 7-4 in 2024, and he expressed a bit of doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago -- he called it a \"disaster\" on Saturday -- as to whether he would even enter the competition in Paris.\n\nHe did show up, though, and trained in front of loud, supportive crowds during the week leading up to competition. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he is currently No. 276 -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, the second day of main draw play.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year; I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he can move more confidently than he has lately and gets the sense he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title in Rome and might be a popular pick as the most talented current player without a Grand Slam singles trophy. He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at the French Open, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier in a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke. It was very much real, and Zverev said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nAt the 2022 French Open, Nadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship -- only Novak Djokovic, the No. 1 seed, has more Grand Slam men's singles titles with 24 -- while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new to him.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023 and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal after that.\n\nSo while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out. About a possible return to the French Open. About how much longer he will be on tour.\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Nadal said. \"Maybe in one month and a half, I'll say, 'OK, it's enough. I can't keep going.' But today, in some way, I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesfreepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/103252184_103252184-1aa8d448970d4eb28d22c052fc0b13bf_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 566, "textEnd": 572}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Pure love, nothing else.\"\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport.\n\n\"It is difficult for me to talk, I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you,\" he said.\n\n\"Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics in the city in July.\n\n\"I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100 per cent keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\nNadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Nadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5-3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn't think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process,\" he before he left to a standing ovation.\n\nNadal all but rules out playing Wimbledon\n\nNadal virtually ruled himself out of a final appearance at Wimbledon this year, saying it will not be \"smart\" to do so before the Olympics.\n\n\"I can't confirm anything, but I don't think it's smart after everything my body has been through,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nNadal has twice been a Wimbledon champion, winning the title in 2008 and 2010 but also enduring some of his toughest moments at the All England Club.\n\nHe last played the tournament in 2022 when he was forced to withdraw before his semi-final against Nick Kyrgios with an abdomen strain.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babolat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Babolat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5f5db2b1b737df4683000bcae93a877d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 153, "textEnd": 159}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at Roland Garros, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier with a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke.\n\nAnd Zverev -- whose ongoing court case related to accusations of domestic abuse by a former girlfriend will resume with a hearing in his native Germany next week -- said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nNadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship at the 2022 French Open while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023, and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal later this season.\n\nAnd while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out. About a possible return to the French Open. About how much longer he will be on tour.\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Nadal said. \"Maybe in one month and a half, I'll say, 'OK, it's enough. I can't keep going.' But today, in some way, I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\"\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal arrives for a training session at the Roland Garros stadium, Saturday, May 25, 2024 in Paris.

The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\n\"I don't know what to say... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it's such a great honour,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.\"\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier.\n\nFaced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nWatched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.\n\nThe boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com", "name": "Bdnews24 Com", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.bdnews24.com/bdnews24/media/english/imgAll/2024May/PLATE/nadal-270524-02-1716833088.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

If it is I have enjoyed it,\" Nadal said in an on-court speech.\n\n\"The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\"\n\nWith some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament's finest champion.\n\nAnticipation for Nadal's return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion - easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and 'Gracias Rafa' T-shirts - milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened.\n\nAfter a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here.\n\nIn a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could \"play against anyone\".\n\nPractice is very different to a match, of course. Nadal knew that and knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev.\n\nWith the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made.\n\nZverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-courter, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight.\n\nHe reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month.\n\nThe way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites.\n\nZverev has insisted a court case over domestic abuse allegations will not distract him. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany.

His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout.\n\nNadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat.\n\nHis three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/05/GettyImages-2154896558-e1716827603872.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 904, "textEnd": 910}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Based on Nadal's past comments, his recent injury history and the fact that he's competing in the 2024 French Open after his injury caused him to miss last year's tournament, it was speculated that Roland Garros could be his final sendoff, similar to Serena Williams taking a final bow at the 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nHowever, Nadal, on the eve of the French Open -- which he's won a record 14 times -- pushed back on that notion that this appearance at Roland Garros would be his final. During a pre-event press conference, Nadal was asked if he had decided that this would be his final French Open.\n\n\"Don't assume that,\" Nadal responded, before noting that physically he feels better than he did weeks ago at the Italian Open, when he lost in straight sets in the second round.\n\n\"It's a big chance it's going to be my last Roland Garros. But if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not because I cannot predict what's going on ... In some way, I don't want to close 100 percent the door.\"\n\nNadal then cited that he still enjoys playing tennis and he cherishes being able to travel with his family. He also said that before, when the speculation arose that he was close to calling it a career, he wasn't able to explore playing tennis without limitation.\n\n\"Today, in some way I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one. But, of course, there's a big chance,\" admitted Nadal to reporters.\n\nThe speculation all stems from Nadal's own comments exactly one year ago when a hip flexor injury caused him to miss the 2023 French Open -- his first time not competing at Roland Garros since being a 17-year-old in 2004.\n\n\"My goal and my ambition is to try to stop and give myself an opportunity to enjoy next year,\" Nadal said in May 2023. \"It's probably going to be my last year in a professional tour.\n\n\"My idea and my motivation is to try to enjoy and say goodbye to all of the tournaments that have been important for me in my tennis career this year.\"\n\nInjuries caused Nadal to not only miss the 2023 French Open, but he also missed last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open. He played just three matches in the entire calendar year, with none coming after January's Australian Open, and he underwent hip surgery in June 2023. The inactivity by Nadal caused him to drop out of the top 10 rankings for the first time since April 2005, thus ending the longest top 10 streak in ATP history. Nadal, who began the year as the No. 2 player in the world ended it ranked No. 670.\n\nHe returned to play at the Brisbane International in the first week of January and had a promising start, knocking off 2020 U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem and then 2023 Australian Open doubles champion Jason Kubler in the first two rounds. However, injury struck again, and that same surgically operated hip flared up in his next match, which he would lose to Jordan Thompson. Nadal would lose more than just the match, as the injury would cause him to miss the year's first major Down Under at the Australian Open.\n\nNadal made his way back to the court in April in his native Spain where he fell in the second round of the Barcelona Open in straight sets. The next week he played in the Madrid Open where he won his first three matches before losing in the fourth round, also in straight sets. His final event before heading to Roland Garros was the Italian Open where he lost in the second round, again in straight sets. So, he is entering the 2024 French Open without having won a match in the quarterfinals or later of any tournament since Wimbledon in July 2022.\n\nDespite a rough last few years, Nadal is focusing on the present because, as he said, he can't predict what the future will hold. His immediate future is facing Alexander Zverev in the first round of the 2024 French Open on Monday. Nadal and Zverev have played 10 times previously, with Nadal holding a 7-3 edge, including a 5-1 record on clay, which is what Roland Garros consists of.\n\nNadal owns a record 14 French Open titles, which is as many as the two men with next-most combined in Max Decugis (eight) and Bjorn Borg (six). His 14 championships at Roland Garros are the same number as the legendary Pete Sampras has titles at all four majors combined. Nadal holds an astounding 112-3 record at the French Open, or a 97.4 percent win rate, and his 22 Grand Slam championships are second most amongst men, trailing only Novak Djokovic's 24.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kubler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kubler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Sampras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Sampras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Thompson_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Thompson (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/05/25/id5657226-GettyImages-2154582748-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-04-", "textStart": 2534, "textEnd": 2544}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He joked. He sounded upbeat. He's been playing well and feeling better in practice. He is eager to get going at Roland Garros after dealing for so long with hip and abdominal problems.\n\nOh, and then there's this little tidbit he dropped during a pre-tournament news conference Saturday: This French Open might not turn out to be the 14-time champion's last appearance, after all, at his favorite event, one he called \"magical.\"\n\nBecause of his age -- he turns 38 on June 3 -- and his injuries, not to mention past statements about figuring 2024 would be his last year on tour, everyone from other players to fans to the media has been assuming it will be his farewell appearance at the French Open.\n\nAsked whether that's accurate, Nadal grinned and replied: \"Don't assume that.\"\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" Nadal said. \"But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nThe Spaniard missed much of the last two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence there since he made his debut as a teenager. He is just 7-4 in 2024, and he expressed a bit of doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago -- he called it a \"disaster\" on Saturday -- as to whether he would even enter the clay-court tournament in Paris at all.\n\nBut he did show up and has been training in front of loud, supportive crowds this week. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he is No. 276 currently -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, Day 2 of the tournament.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year; I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he can move more confidently than he has been and gets the sense he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title in Rome and might be a popular pick as the most talented player yet to win a Grand Slam trophy. He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at Roland Garros, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier with a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke.\n\nAnd Zverev -- whose ongoing court case related to accusations of domestic abuse by a former girlfriend will resume with a hearing in his native Germany next week -- said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nNadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship at the 2022 French Open while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023, and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal later this season.\n\nAnd while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out. About a possible return to the French Open. About how much longer he will be on tour.\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Nadal said. \"Maybe in one month and a half, I'll say, 'OK, it's enough. I can't keep going.' But today, in some way, I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

He's definitely going to be back for the Olympics, but just for Roland Garros, there is uncertainty.\n\n\"I would say the improvement he has made over the last few months and the difference in level he played today was unbelievable.\n\n\"I really felt like it was a very good match and if he stays healthy, he will continue to play better. Then he will be seeded again and that makes it a lot easier for him, for sure.\"\n\nNadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd.\n\n\"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said.\n\n\"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\"\n\nMeanwhile, tennis legend Boris Becker gave his verdict on Zverev's performance as he suggested Nadal should be optimistic about what is to come in the final months of his career after an improved display against the German.\n\n\"Sascha was the better player right from the start,\" Becker told Eurosport. \"He broke Nadal's first service game straight away and never let up. For me, the second set was decisive when Nadal was ahead and then lost the tie-break. It was clear then that Zverev would be the winner.\n\n\"I believe that Rafa will still play the Olympics at Roland Garros, but I don't think he'll play the French Open again in 2025.\n\n\"Of course, he has emotions and probably had a sleepless night because he didn't know whether it would be the last time. He wanted to say goodbye well. Then his opponent was Zverev, against whom he can lose even on a good day. That's why it was emotionally very difficult for Nadal.\n\n\"Sascha started with a deep return and then worked his way into the rallies. The longer the rallies became over the course of the match, the better Zverev got. That's unusual against Nadal - and he's the king of Paris. He dominates the baseline and the centre of the court because he can then send his opponent running.

But Zverev went into this match expecting 'peak Rafael Nadal' and was fully prepared for the Spanish veteran to be operating at a high level, going 40-love up himself for a 4-2 lead.\n\nThe duo traded service games for 5-3 - leaving Zverev just one game away from taking the first set - and he clocked up three set points on Nadal's serve in game nine to clinch it 6-3 as the crowd on court Philippe-Chatrier went totally silent.\n\nIn the second set, both players held in their opening two service games for 2-2, with Nadal knocking up a break point in game five and converting it with a beautiful drop shot to raise the roof as spectators got behind the 37-year-old.\n\nNadal held to open up a 4-2 lead and another trade of service games saw Nadal one game away from levelling up the match. He appeared to get complacent, though, as Zverev held and then went 40-love up on Nadal's serve in game 10, registering his third break of the match to level up the second set at 5-5.\n\nThat put the fire back in Nadal's belly as he knocked up two chances to break back, only for Zverev to save both of them, with the set eventually going to a tie-break as the German came out on top 7-5 to open up a two-set lead.\n\nNadal looked to keep the match alive as he held in game one of the third set and then broke Zverev to lead 2-0. But Zverev was not letting his lead slip away in a hurry as he responded with an instant break back and held to level it up at 2-2.\n\nNadal was then firmly on the ropes as he denied Zverev the double break four times, with both players producing holds to take it to 3-3. The German stayed patient, though, and eventually got his fifth break of the match to lead 4-3.\n\nThat led to passionate screams of 'Rafa, Rafa, Rafa' from the Philippe-Chatrier crowd as the looked to inspire the Spaniard into an unlikely comeback but he was ultimately unable to register one as Zverev closed out the match in straight sets.\n\nIt was widely expected that 2024 would be the final time Rafael Nadal would play the French Open given his public comments, but ahead of his opening match, he has appeared to suggest it may not be his last dance after all.\n\n'In terms if that's going to be my last Roland Garros, it's a long answer, but I think I need to answer that, because we're going to avoid future questions since the beginning - so I'm going to do it,' Nadal said.\n\n'As I said, it's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 per cent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand.\n\n'Myself, I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, a recovering process that seems like I feel better now.\n\n'I am not a guy that reacts because I lost there or I lost in the other place, no? I react about my personal feelings, and my personal feelings are better now than one month and a half ago, without a doubt.\n\n'So in some way I don't want to close, 100 per cent, the door, because of a very simple thing. First thing, I am enjoying playing tennis. Second thing, I am travelling with the family. They are enjoying and I am enjoying sharing all this process with them.\n\n'And the third thing, I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play in more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\n\n'So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, 'okay it's enough, I can't keep going', but today in some way I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one. But of course it's a big chance.'\n\nWorld No.1 Iga Swiatek, the heavy favourite for the women's singles trophy, kicked off her title defence in style with a 6-1 6-2 win over Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek headed into Roland-Garros in impressive form, beating world No.2 Aryna Sabalenka and world No.3 Coco Gauff in Rome to clinch the Italian Open title.\n\nAnd the Polish superstar barely broke a sweat in her first French Open match to set up an exciting clash with four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka in Paris.\n\n'It feels like home here,' Swiatek said after her victory over Jeanjean. 'Hopefully, I'm going to be here as long as possible.\n\n'I think it's too early [to be called Queen of clay]. I'm really proud of my achievements and this has always been my favourite surface.\n\n'I'm just at the beginning but I will try to take some lessons from [Rafael Nadal] on being a good person and a good player.'\n\nJannik Sinner is one of the favourites for the French Open men's singles title but arrived in Paris with a hip injury.\n\nHe moved well in a 6-3 6-3 6-4 opening win over Christopher Eubanks, though, and only looked somewhat troubled while he was serving out the match.\n\nAhead of his second-round battle with Richard Gasquet, Sinner said: 'The hip is good, I am very happy. The general shape is not at 100 per cent yet so we try to build every day.'\n\nNovak Djokovic gets started against French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Tuesday as he begins his quest to clinch a historic 25th Grand Slam singles title.\n\nBritish No.1 Katie Boulter also plays her opening match on Tuesday, with an interesting battle against former world No.2 Paula Badosa.\n\nMORE : Enzo Maresca

Nadal drew world No. 4 Sasha Zverev in the first-round; the German was coming off a title at the Italian Open and is eyeing his first Grand Slam title in a wide open field.\n\nThat's especially true after Zverev beat Nadal 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 at the French Open on Monday, dashing the hopes of a deep run for the tournament's most successful athlete. And although the 37-year-old clay court specialist wouldn't confirm or deny whether he would play in France next year, he is hoping to be back on these courts for the 2026 Summer Olympics in just two months.\n\n\"Body is feeling a bit better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough,\" Nadal said in a rare post-match interview for the losing player. \"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't know if it's going to be last time I'm going to be here in front of you. I am not 100% sure, but if it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing in the whole week of preparation. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it's so special to feel the love from the people in the place I love the most.\n\n\"It's a big percentage that I will not be back here playing at Roland Garros, but I've enjoyed it a lot. I'm traveling with the family, having fun and the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago.\"\n\nWhat Rafael Nadal achieved at Roland Garros will never be matched\n\nDespite a disappointing ending for one of the sport's most prolific players, Nadal will go down as the best clay court player ever -- and his 14 titles at the French Open will never be matched.\n\nSince he began competing in 2003, Nadal has ridiculously lost just four matches at the tournament, including Monday's defeat to Zverev. His record at Roland Garros stands at an outrageous 112-4.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I will be here with almost 28 [years of age] - 38, I would love to be 28,\" Nadal said to the crowd at the end. \"I couldn't have dreamed it. It's been a beautiful process, all the memories have been different, but nonetheless special. The feelings that you make me feel here are unforgettable, thanks very much from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nNadal reportedly told Roland Garros finalist Alex Corretja last week that his body was \"feeling pain free for the first time in two years,\" which certainly opens the door to him continuing to compete in 2025. But that is a long way away.\n\nIt will be intriguing to see if Nadal will compete in one more French Open in 2025 -- and maybe get a better draw if so.

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.\"\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics' tennis competition will be held at the French Open's site.\n\nWhen Monday's match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars.\n\nNot so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars.\n\nOnce more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I'm 28,\" Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: \"Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\n\"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\"\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will be the third match on the No.1 court at Stade Roland Garros following two women's singles matches.\n\nNadal heads into the game on the back of a 5-3 win-loss record on clay, including two second-round exits in Madrid and Rome and a run to the fourth round in Madrid. Over the last two seasons, Nadal has dodged two hip injury issues. The first was incurred during his second-round loss in Australian Open 2023 after which he missed the entire season. On making a return after 349 days, earlier this year in Brisbane, hoping for a return in Melbourne for the season's first Slam, Nadal suffered a fresh injury blow that saw him skip the hardcourt season. He only returned to action in Barcelona last month in a bid to gear up for the most cherished event of his career.\n\nMeanwhile, Zverev lifted the Italian Open title last week after a third-round exit in Madrid Masters. He is the fourth seeded player in the draw and and is will be the overwhelming favourite on Monday, despite Nadal's mind-bending record in Paris.\n\nAs we gear up for the highly anticipated round one clash at the 2024 French Open, let's delve into the details of the monumental Rafael Nadal vs Alexander Zverev match.\n\nNadal and Zverev have faced each other 10 times in the ATP circuit with the Spaniard leading 7-3. The veteran star also won both the Grand Slam encounters in their rivalry, although the last one, which was at the 2022 French Open semis, Zverev was forced to retire after incurring an ankle twist during the second set tie-break.\n\nRafael Nadal vs Alexander Zverev French Open 2024 French Open 2024 Round One match will be on May 27 at 6:00 PM IST.\n\nRafael Nadal vs Alexander Zverev French Open 2024 Round One match will be aired live on Sony Ten Network in India.\n\nRafael Nadal vs Alexander Zverev French Open 2024 Round One match can be live streamed on Sony Liv app or website in India.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/26/1600x900/New_Project_-_2022-06-03T163156442_1716738360976_1716738361175.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 1834, "textEnd": 1840}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

However, he later said, \"I really hope to see you again -- but I don't know.\"\n\nWith his defeat to world number four Zverev, 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, suffered just his fourth defeat in 116 meetings at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut.\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport.\n\n\"It is difficult for me to talk, I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you,\" he said.\n\n\"Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics in the city in July.\n\n\"I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100% keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\n- 'Thank you Rafa' -\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour,\" said Zverev.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment.\"\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\n- 'Beautiful process' -\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn't think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process,\" said Nadal before he left to a standing ovation.", "source": {"uri": "tv360nigeria.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TV360 Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydney_okafor@tv360nigeria.com", "name": "Sydney Okafor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.tv360nigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/TENNIS-FRA-OPEN-2024_280524n02_1716829567.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 326, "textEnd": 332}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

An acknowledgement he is past his best but not done.\n\nThe match against Zverev showed that.\n\nFor all the off-court allegations against the German, who will face a trial shortly in relation to domestic violence charges, he is a tremendous tennis player.\n\nZverev won the Rome Masters just weeks ago and should be considered a favourite to lift the title here, which would be his maiden slam.\n\nComing off 18 months' worth of debilitating injuries, the old bull pushed him past three hours on court.\n\nNadal was up a break in both the second and third sets before the bigger hitter blasted him off the court.\n\nLacking match practice, he just couldn't put Zverev away.\n\nAnd Todd Woodbridge has probably never said more poignant words on commentary.\n\nWoodbridge might not be wrong.\n\nIt may have been a lesser Nadal who shot an errant forehand wide on match point, but he wasn't poor. Even as the cameras cut to Spanish number one and Nadal successor Carlos Alcaraz in the stands, anguish etched on his face, Nadal could be proud.\n\nThe crowd chanted \"Rafa\" as even Zverev looked broken and disconsolate at what he had just done.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say,\" the 27-year-old German said to perfectly capture the flummoxed Parisian crowd, who have so rarely seen Nadal lose.\n\n\"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour.\n\n\"I have watched Rafa play all my childhood and was lucky enough to play him several times on this beautiful court.\n\nTrue enough, but the victory was arguably poetic.\n\nIn 2022, Zverev was in a dogfight of a semifinal with Nadal when he slid and shattered his ankle in the second-set tiebreak.\n\nPlenty thought he could have beaten Rafa that day, which would have taken him to number one in the world.\n\nNadal said as much too.\n\n\"I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match and victory, I really wish you all the best,\" he said after their first-round clash.\n\n\"2022 I know was a super tough moment for you.\"\n\nIf 2022 was a tough moment for Zverev, then 2023 and 2024 were full of them for Nadal.\n\nAfter winning the Australian and French Opens in 2022, injury hit in Melbourne in 2023 and he has never been the same, frequently talking about the end of his glittering career.\n\nEven now the Spaniard sounds conflicted, but one more shot at glory looms large.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through all this process to be here back at Roland Garros,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it is enough, but that is something I don't feel yet.\n\n\"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that is going to be another chance.\"\n\nFather Time is famously cruel though. It robbed Federer of glory at his final Wimbledon and possibly Nadal at a final French Open.\n\nThe Olympics come with a different pressure -- carrying the weight of a nation.\n\nNadal is already an Olympic men's singles gold medallist, something he has that eludes rivals Federer and Djokovic, who had a meltdown at the previous Games.\n\nTennis in Paris will be played at Roland Garros and it might just give Nadal a better farewell than the one at this tournament, but he will need to stay healthy and continue to raise his level.\n\nHis history on the French clay is strong enough that no-one would rule it out completely, but whether the sporting gods play fair is another issue.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

Now two years later, the result was very different.\n\nNadal fell in straight sets - 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 - in a grueling three-hour match that the 14-time French Open winner said would likely be his final match at Roland Garros. He finishes with a record of 112 wins and four losses.\n\nHe was still Rafa, but muted. A little slower than we remember. A little heavier in the feet. The shots that used to fall so artfully on the line were now a few centimeters wide.\n\nIt wasn't until the fifth game of the first set that Nadal started to really look like himself. He finally began hitting the ball with authority, attacking instead of constantly reacting, and using the entire court to challenge Zverev.\n\nBut it just wasn't enough. Nadal has 112 career wins at Roland Garros, but we may have reached the point where that experience is a burden and no longer an advantage. He has 10 years on the 27-year-old Zverev, and a long history of foot, hip and abdominal injuries. He's already dealt with hip and abdominal issues this season, which is one of the reasons Nadal looked tentative on Monday.\n\nFlashes of the real Rafa were there. He could still hit the ball into impossible corners and create shots that no human could hope to return. Those moments were infrequent, but they were there.\n\nAnd those moments built a foundation for Nadal to stand on in the second set. Down 2-1, he caught fire, finally unearthing his cross-court backhand and winning five points in a row for the first time in the match. He won the game to even the set at 2-2, jumping with delight while the capacity crowd at Philippe Chatrier delivered a deafening response. The audience was even louder when he won his second straight game to break Zverev for the first time.\n\nNadal fought back in the third set, thrilling the spectators at Court Philippe-Chatrier as he crossed the court to catch Zverev's returns. But the constant pressure by Zverev wore Nadal down and he finally succumbed.\n\nWith an admiring crowd giving an adoring cheer for Nadal, Zverev was gracious in speaking after the match, ceding the moment to his renowned opponent.\n\n\"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" he said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and was lucky enough to play him when I turned professional. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment. Thank you.\"\n\nNadal then took the microphone to thank the fans.\n\n\"Bonjour a tous. I'd like to thank you all, it's an incredible opportunity,\" said Nadal, who missed last year's tournament with a hip injury. \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time in front of all of you. Honestly, I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries,\" he added. \"I went through all these processes with the dream to come back to Roland Garros. The first round [draw] wasn't ideal. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_roscher@aol.com", "name": "Liz Roscher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/znb9hIPJDA4GtTe5AwqOmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/26d027bc515d20cf74b94b7524ee2916", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury.\n\nIn his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\n'Thank you Rafa'\n\nZverev said it had been \"a great honour\" to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34. Advertisement\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Advertisement\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention. Advertisement\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.

Ra-fa!\" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be.", "source": {"uri": "virginislandsdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virgin Islands Daily News"}, "authors":

And why is he unseeded?", "body": "FILE - Germany's Alexander Zverev is carried off the court after twisting his ankle during the semifinal match against Spain's Rafael Nadal, left, at the French Open tennis tournament in Roland Garros stadium in Paris, France, Friday, June 3, 2022. Rafael Nadal is in the French Open field, after all, and the 14-time champion was set up for a challenging first-round matchup in Thursday's draw against Alexander Zverev.\n\nPARIS (AP) -- The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

I hope you understand,\" said the Spaniard.\n\nNadal, who will celebrate his 38th birthday on June 3, faces world number four Alexander Zverev in the first round in Paris on Monday.\n\nThe Spanish legend has racked up 112 wins in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning 2005 debut when he was just 19.\n\nHe has 22 Grand Slam titles -- second only to Novak Djokovic's 24 on the all-time men's list -- but his career has been plagued by injuries.\n\nNadal has played just four tournaments since January last year after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear.\n\nAs a result, his ranking has slumped to 276 in the world and he comes into the French Open unseeded.\n\n\"I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, but I feel better now,\" he added.\n\n\"I have fewer limitations than three, four weeks ago, without a doubt.\"\n\nNadal had to sit out the 2023 French Open through injury.\n\nThe year before he won his 14th title but revealed that he could only play with daily pain-killing injections in his feet.\n\n\"In some ways I don't want to close the door 100%. I am enjoying playing tennis. I am travelling with the family. They are enjoying,\" added Nadal on his reluctance to call time on his career.\n\n\"So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, okay, it's enough, I can't keep going, but today in some way I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one. But of course it's a big chance.\"\n\nNadal arrives in Paris having yet to make a clay-court quarter-final this season. In Rome, he was defeated in the second round.\n\n\"I feel competitive in training. Maybe not in an official match, but when I enter the court, I feel like I can beat anyone,\" he said.\n\nNadal holds a 7-3 winning record over Zverev.\n\nFive of those victories came on clay including a semi-final triumph at Roland Garros in 2022 when the German was forced to quit with ankle ligament damage.\n\nIn Paris so far this week, Nadal has practised in front of packed courts.\n\nHe hit with fellow former champion Stan Wawrinka who described Nadal as \"strong as ever\".\n\nFifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev, who trained with him on Thursday, said he was happy not to face him in the first round.\n\n\"This place is magical for me. If in the bottom of my heart, I didn't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I would not be here in front of you guys,\" added Nadal.\n\n\"So I still have the motivation and a small, at least is a small hope to play well.\"\n\nAnd if 2024 turns out to be Nadal's French Open farewell?\n\n\"I just can say thanks to all the love I received from all the players, from the organisers, from the tournaments, from all the community of tennis and sport.\n\n\"I feel very proud that probably I leave a positive legacy there.\"\n\nFrench veteran Gael Monfils, who is also 37 and first played Nadal in 2005, said: \"we should enjoy it as much as we can\".\n\n\"I wonder if we're not going back to traditional tournaments as they were played a long time ago, because the last 20 years are not run-of-the-mill normal years,\" added Monfils of two decades dominated by Nadal, Novak Djokovic and the now-retired Roger Federer.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga\u00ebl_Monfils", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ga\u00ebl Monfils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-05/nfdap3l8_rafael-nadal-afp_625x300_22_May_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 505, "textEnd": 511}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He expressed his wish to return for the Paris 2024 Olympics amidst an outpouring of love and support from fans. Despite glimpses of his brilliance, Nadal couldn't secure victory.\n\nRafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nAs soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nIn the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nThe Spaniard missed much of the last two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence there since he made his debut as a teenager. He is just 7-4 in 2024, and he expressed a bit of doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago -- he called it a \"disaster\" on Saturday -- as to whether he would even enter the clay-court tournament in Paris at all.\n\nBut he did show up and has been training in front of loud, supportive crowds this week. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he is No. 276 currently -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, Day 2 of the tournament.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year; I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he can move more confidently than he has been and gets the sense he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title in Rome and might be a popular pick as the most talented player yet to win a Grand Slam trophy. He was the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open and was at the top of his game two years ago at Roland Garros, when he took on Nadal in the semifinals but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right ankle and was taken out of Court Philippe Chatrier with a wheelchair.\n\nWhen Zverev's brother, former player Mischa, informed him of the draw's outcome on Thursday, Zverev said he figured it was a joke.\n\nAnd Zverev -- whose ongoing court case related to accusations of domestic abuse by a former girlfriend will resume with a hearing in his native Germany next week -- said he can't go into Monday's match thinking about facing a diminished Nadal.\n\n\"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said. \"I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nNadal wound up winning his 22nd major championship at the 2022 French Open while playing on a left foot that hurt so much he needed nerve-numbing injections. So competing at something less than perfect health is nothing new.\n\nHe hurt his hip during a second-round loss at the Australian Open in January 2023, and later had an operation. A comeback this January was stalled by a tear in a hip muscle near that original injury. A recurrence of an abdominal issue hampered Nadal later this season.\n\nAnd while Nadal has often intimated retirement is beckoning, he said Saturday that he doesn't \"want to close, 100%, the door,\" because he is enjoying playing tennis, he likes traveling with his wife and young son and, he added, \"I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play, being in, again, more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nHe asked Saturday for a halt to questions about his future while he figures things out. About a possible return to the French Open. About how much longer he will be on tour.\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Nadal said. \"Maybe in one month and a half, I'll say, 'OK, it's enough. I can't keep going.' But today, in some way, I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

Through it all, Rafael Nadal's mastery over the clay courts in Paris never diminished.\n\nThe Spaniard won a record 14 titles at Roland Garros, a domination hitherto unheard of in tennis, and quite possibly, one that may never be repeated again. On clay, Nadal has won a record 63 titles including a record 26 Masters 1000 titles. Nadal's 479-49 win-loss record on the surface is the best in the Open era.\n\nIt is only fair to wonder if Nadal was indeed moulded from the red clay he came to work his magic on for a better part of this century.\n\nOn Monday, however, the tennis world likely witnessed an emotional end to a two decade-long love story between Nadal and the French Open as the Spaniard, struggling with injuries and the ravages of time, bowed out in the first round of the 2024 edition with a straight sets loss to Alexander Zverev.\n\nIt is a testament to Nadal's sheer domination at the French Open that Zverev, who won, 6-3, 7-6 (3), 6-3, became only the third man after Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic to beat Nadal at the tournament.\n\nIf it was indeed Nadal's swansong at the tournament, he departs having won 112 of the 116 matches he played in Paris - a staggering 96.55 win percentage. No other player in the Open era comes close to matching the 37-year-old Spaniard's record at Roland Garros at any other tournament.\n\nPerhaps, no other sport has had a player or a team's domination over a single tournament quite like what Nadal has had over the French Open.\n\nTo illustrate how bonkers Nadal's reign in Paris has been, only Djokovic and Roger Federer have won more men's Grand Slams - 24 and 20 respectively - than Nadal's 14 French Open titles. Overall, Nadal has 22 men's singles Majors.\n\nThe top three longest winning streaks at the French Open all belong to Nadal (39, 35 and 31 matches). Only Bjorn Borg at Wimbledon (41), and Federer at Wimbledon (40) and the US Open (40) have had longer winning streaks at a Grand Slam in the Open era than Nadal.\n\nUltimately, it is the body that had slid across the clay courts of Paris for the last 20 years, that has finally worn down. Recurreing injuries have tested Nadal's mettle over the past two years even as he retained the never-back-down mentality that propelled him to greatness.\n\nInjuries saw Nadal miss almost the entire of the 2023 season, as he was forced to miss a first French Open since his 2005 debut. After announcing his withdrawal from the tournament last year, Nadal also stated that the 2024 season was likely going to be his final season on the tour.\n\nIn the run-up to the French Open however, Nadal did not close the door to playing beyond 2024.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that this is going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on,\" he said before the tournament.\n\n\"In some ways I don't want to close the door 100%. I am enjoying playing tennis. I am travelling with the family. They are enjoying. So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, 'okay, it's enough, I can't keep going,' but today in some way I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one. But of course it's a big chance.\"\n\nEven in what may have been his final moments in the French Open, as a player, Nadal refused to call it quits. Just like the way he played.\n\nDespite what many tennis romantics would have hoped, there was no miraculous win over Zverev for Nadal. And yet, you could see why Nadal wasn't fully committed to calling time on his career.\n\nThere were glimpses of the Nadal who made the clay courts of Paris his own. He was imperious at the net and even though the forehands had lost their zip, there were times they still troubled Zverev - a player ranked No 4 in the world.\n\nEver the fighter, it was a sentiment he repeated on Monday after his loss.\n\nSpeaking about Nadal's possible farewell at the French Open, Federer hoped his eternal rival would not bid adieu from the couch but rather on the court.\n\n\"If he says 'ciao', he will do it on a court and not on his couch, and I love that because he is very far from being 100%,\" Federer said.\n\nNadal will be back on the courts of Roland Garros later this year when he competes at the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nIf not to win an improbable gold medal, then perhaps to simply give fans, on the fabled Parisian clay, one last opportunity to say, \"Merci, Maestro.\"", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dilip_unnikrishnan@scroll.in", "name": "Dilip Unnikrishnan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/book/201011-mlkcmthbic-1716865535.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

But this year, both have been in contrasting forms. Zverev is entering the French Open with his recent win at the Italian Open and he also became World No. 4. Meanwhile, Nadal has had fourth-round and second-round finishes at the Madrid Open and Italian Open. He is also currently ranked at World No. 276.\n\nSpeaking on his Roland Garros opener, Nadal said, \"At some point somebody told me the draw. I mean, the reaction is something that I expected in some way. When you're not seeded, anything can happen. That's part of the business.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zverev revealed that he would have preferred to face the Spanish legend at a later stage in the tournament. \"Ideally I would have liked to play him in at a later stage of the tournament um but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year, I am seeded. It's a tough draw but it's a tough draw for both of us and we'll see how it goes,\" he said.\n\nTheir 2022 French Open semi-final meet was interesting.

The German made a mark in his maiden match against Nadal, saving two set points before taking the first set in a tie-break. Nadal fought back to force a decider, but Zverev created the chance to serve for victory when leading 5-3, only to miss a match point and lose five straight games as he tumbled to defeat.\n\nThe pair's second meeting was their first at a Grand Slam tournament. Zverev took control of the match early on, building a two-sets-to-one lead. But again Nadal battled back in trademark fashion, eventually securing victory after more than four hours on court. Nadal went on to lose a memorable final against Roger Federer.\n\nZverev's first defence of a Masters 1000 title was a strong one in Rome six years ago, as he set up his only meeting with Nadal in a final to date. The Spaniard, though, was too strong for his young rival once more, clinching his eighth of 10 Rome triumphs with his fifth win against Zverev in as many matches.\n\nZverev finally got the better of Nadal at the 2019 season-ending Finals in London during the group phase. The German dominated on the indoor hard court and eventually finished second in the group ahead of Nadal on set difference. But Zverev's title defence ended in the semi-finals with defeat by Dominic Thiem.\n\nNadal and Zverev's most recent meeting was their most memorable. Ahead of the second time they had played each other at a Grand Slam and the first time in the second week, Zverev had high hopes of becoming only the third player to ever defeat Nadal at Roland Garros. Nadal won a marathon first set after Zverev blew a 6-2 lead in the tie-break. After more than three hours on court, Zverev suffered a nasty ankle injury while hitting a forehand wide which levelled the second set at 6-6, leaving the court in a wheelchair before confirming he could not continue. Nadal beat Casper Ruud in the final to win his 14th French Open.

After his fairytale comeback to the Roland Garros came to an early end on Monday, Nadal explained that it will be difficult for him to transition from clay court to grass court, keeping the Paris Olympics 2024 in mind. Having missed out on a long stretch of action due to recurring injuries, Nadal's 3-6, 6-7, 3-6 loss to Zverev, was also his first grand-slam appearance of the year.\n\nWith the Olympics being set to take place from July 26, which falls exactly in between th French Open and Wimbledon 2024, which is set to begin from July 1. This setup will require the recently recovered Nadal to make a quick switch between clay and grass within a matter of days, which the Spaniard himself is not confident about. With the increased speculation about the 36-year-old having had his final dance at Roland Garros this year, his comments have only amped up the speculation about his appearances in other major grand slams across the whole year.\n\n\"Looks difficult for me now to make the transition to grass & having the Olympics to play on clay just after. I have to analyse but I don't think it would be smart after all the things that happened to my body,\" Nadal said after his French Open clash against Zverev.\n\nNadal, who was playing his making his Grand Slam return after missing out on the Australian Open, did showcase his usual vintage shots throughout the game, with the fans in the stands majorly backing the Spaniard. Coming into the catchup, Nadal was considered the underdog against Zverev, but ultimately gave a healthy competition to the German.\n\nThe match had some stunning tennis all out and often saw Nadal giving a strong fightback to Zverev. However, it was not enough to beat Zverev, who ultimately got his revenge for his exit in the semi-final of the 2022 French Open.

Just like years previous, the crowd roared ever louder as their hero warmed up, against the backdrop of stadium announcer Marc Maury reading out his incredible list of French Open triumphs.\n\nBut as the match went on against Alexander Zverev, the cheers switched from those of excitement to nervousness, and as it slipped away from him, the crowd tried to will him on.\n\nIf this does prove to be Nadal's final swing at the French Open men's singles title, then he went down fighting against Zverev. Though Nadal has been at pains all week to play down the notion of this fortnight in Paris being a destination on his farewell tour, there was a feeling of finality. His old foe Novak Djokovic was in the crowd. His fans and Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz were there too, not a seat free on this showpiece court at Roland Garros, for a first-round match. They all collectively hoped for one last Nadal hurrah -- just like Serena Williams' fans did at the US Open in 2022.\n\nBut tennis is brutal, and there is little room for sentimentality. For all of Nadal's attempts to claw himself back into the match, the trumpet fanfares, the red and yellow flags in the crowd and moments which were inescapably reminiscent of the Nadal of old, there would be no final flourish at Roland Garros. For this year, at least.\n\nEVER SINCE NADAL made his debut here in 2005, winning the men's singles title the same year, this place has become synonymous with him. His record is frankly ridiculous: winning 14 singles titles, a record of 112 wins in 116 matches, translating to a win percentage of 96.5% -- the highest winning percentage of any singles tennis player in a major. He managed to win the 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 tournaments without dropping a set. His defeat to Zverev means Nadal has only ever lost to three men here. Zverev now sits alongside Robin Soderling (fourth round, 2009) and Djokovic (2015 quarterfinals, 2021 semifinals) in having defeated Nadal in Paris.\n\nAll of that has transformed him into this legendary figure, yet the beauty of it is, unlike with many masters, you can still witness his craft: He's still there in front of you, unleashing that famous forehand, complete with the familiar pre-serve setup routine.\n\n\"I consider myself lucky that I'm here, that I can still see him, in the locker room or in the players' restaurant, or seeing him practice with the passion he has -- it's amazing,\" Jannik Sinner said Friday. \"He's for sure the biggest inspiration we have in our sport, no?\" For further evidence of the love that surrounds Nadal, take Alize Cornet's reaction to a good luck message he sent to her ahead of her retirement.\n\nBut whether this is the last time we'll see him in the French Open, only he knows. He has been reluctant to surrender any control over his fortunes here -- even to the extent that he reportedly lobbied to have his first-round match in the afternoon, rather than the showpiece evening slot. Those are his preferred conditions -- less humidity, lighter tennis balls.\n\n\"Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever.\"\n\nFor so long, this seemed likely to be his last hurrah. That was the narrative anyway, ever since he announced in May 2023 that he was pulling out of the French Open (subsequently spending the rest of the year sidelined after hip surgery) and in that same news conference saying 2024 would likely be his \"last year\" on tour.\n\n\"I don't think I deserve to end like this,\" he said at the time, sitting in his tennis academy in Manacor, Spain. He wanted to finish his career on the court one final time, sweaty and exhausted.\n\nThat news conference teed up this season as his farewell tour; it was certainly enough for the organizers of the French Open to plan a goodbye ceremony for Nadal this year. But then came the curveball. On Saturday -- in front of a standing-room-only news conference -- he added his own topspin to the debate over his future. He took control of the narrative: no longer was this a long goodbye, but instead, he opened the door to playing on beyond 2024.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on.\" He added he didn't want to \"close 100% the door,\" saying he was enjoying his tennis, loving having his family with him on tour and still figuring out what his body can handle.\n\nHE CAME TO the French Open in patchy form -- 5-3 on clay this year -- as he recovered from an abdominal injury that cut short his hard-court season at the start of the year. He was forced to sit out Monte Carlo, and his withdrawal sparked concerns he wouldn't be fit in time for Roland Garros. \"My body won't let me [return],\" Nadal said at the time. \"It's getting difficult for me. It's been a difficult year and a half, I'm trying every day.\"\n\nBut he did make it back in time for Barcelona, where he lost in the second round to Alex De Minaur. In Madrid, he faced De Minaur again and won in straight sets, but still, he wasn't sure if his body could manage Paris.\n\n\"It's difficult to understand some things, but for me, Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever,\" Nadal said in Madrid. \"So it is not a thing about losing or winning. It's about going on court there with the feeling that I can fight and I can be competitive and, you know, let's go on court and dream about what can happen.\"\n\nHe'd eventually lose in the round of 16 to Jiri Lehecka, while in Rome he was picked apart by Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in straight sets. All the while, people were saying goodbye to him: At the Madrid Open they unfurled a banner saying \"Gracias Rafa,\" recognizing his five wins there.\n\nBut amid all the nostalgia overload and unpredictable form was a resolute Nadal, focused on adding his 23rd Grand Slam title. A source close to Nadal told ESPN that in the lead-up to the French Open he was training, without pain, three hours a time and was building confidence. He came into the tournament unseeded, ranked 272 in the world, but not one player on the men's draw would have wanted to have drawn him. Carlos Alcaraz was asked whether he secretly wanted to draw his hero Nadal in the first round. \"No, honestly,\" he answered, smiling.\n\nThe players are fully aware of the aura around him at Roland Garros. \"You're not playing the statue, you're playing the actual person. But you are playing Rafa Nadal,\" Zverev said before their first-round match. \"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nPlaying Nadal at Roland Garros is as much a mental task as it is skill. \"He has the capability to spin the ball not like other players,\" Daniil Medvedev said. \"Getting these high balls, especially on clay, is not easy. Then we go to where he fights for every point, he brings intensity to every point. You know you're going to be tired, you know it's going to be tough. It's not easy. Rafa will always be Rafa.\"\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas, talking in Monte Carlo in mid-April, summed up what it's like to play Nadal. \"I think he's the ultimate challenge on clay.\"\n\nThat's what it comes back to, that expectation that regardless of what shape he's in or his previous run of form, at Roland Garros, he finds a way to make it work. He came into the 2022 tournament with a 4-2 record on clay that year and ended up winning the whole thing, despite a foot injury.\n\nThe players don't forget moments like that. \"Regardless of the fact that he hasn't played much, he is who he is in Roland Garros,\" Djokovic said.\n\nNADAL WILL FOREVER be a legend at the French Open. It's just a question of whether we'll see him again in this tournament. His old sparring partner certainly hopes so.\n\n\"If he says 'ciao,' he will do it on a court and not on his couch, and I love that because he is very far from being 100%,\" Roger Federer said on the French TV program \"Telematin\" earlier this week. \"I don't know anything, but I would like it to end as he has decided, with his family and his team. I would like him to continue on the circuit a little longer than people believe.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

After missing last year's tournament through injury, Nadal will be keen to make the most of his return, as will his fans, but standing in his way is fourth-seeded German Zverev, fresh from his triumph at the Italian Open.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is,\" Nadal said. \"I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories. Zverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam. The German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said. \"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nWorld number two Sinner makes his return to action after sitting out the Italian Open following a hip injury at the Madrid Open, and takes on American Christopher Eubanks. Iga Swiatek begins her title defence against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean, and the Polish world number one comes to Paris on the back of title wins in Madrid and Rome.\n\nAmerican third seed Coco Gauff plays 21-year-old qualifier Julia Avdeeva, with the Russian making her Grand Slam debut.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9olia_Jeanjean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9olia Jeanjean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eubanks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Eubanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/15_01_2022_11_18_30_8021152.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The Court Philippe-Chatrier people witnessed vintage Nadal moments with the 14-time champion playing the best tennis, especially with his trademark forehand passing shot in a three-hour and 5-minute match.\n\nThe Spaniard voiced his appreciation to the fans for their unwavering support throughout the game, citing that he wasn't sure if it might be his last Roland Garros appearance.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable. I never dreamed I would be here at almost 38 years old, with all the success I had here, winning so many times - it is something that I never dreamt of,\" Nadal said as quoted by Roland Garros.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what will happen in the future. It's a big percentage that I won't be back at Roland-Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. I enjoy playing here, I like travelling with the family, and my body is feeling a little bit better than it did two months ago,\" he added.\n\nFor now, Nadal will look to continue testing himself against the best players in the world, with dreams of being back in Paris for the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games.\n\n\"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me,\" Nadal said with a smile.\n\nAfter three hours and five minutes, though, Zverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under duress proved to be too much to overcome. Talk of this intriguing matchup, a replay of their Paris semifinal from two years prior, when they played for almost three hours before Zverev was forced to withdraw due to a terrible ankle injury, began as soon as the draw was announced at Roland Garros.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic all sat in the stands to watch the event because there was so much hype around the match.\n\nThe match was fiercely battled for a straight-sets victory, but every time Nadal appeared to have the upper hand and unite the boisterous audience behind him, Zverev came up with a countermove to regain the upper hand.

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon.\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semifinal.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev's fast start\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nSwiatek makes strong start\n\nWomen's World No. 1 Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarterfinalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\nDaniil Medvedev had lost in the first round on five of his previous seven Roland Garros appearances, but made no mistake this time, seeing off Dominik Koepfer in four sets.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open titleholder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nBut sixth-seeded Greek Maria Sakkari bowed out in the first round for the second straight year with a three-set loss to Varvara Gracheva.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com",

NBC, NBCSports.com, the NBC Sports app and Peacock coverage begins at 11 a.m. ET following coverage on Tennis Channel.\n\nNadal-Zverev is the third scheduled match on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nPlay begins on the court at 6 a.m. ET with two women's singles matches: No. 8 seed Ons Jabeur facing American Sachia Vickery, then top seed Iga Swiatek playing France's Leolia Jeanjean followed by Nadal-Zverev.\n\nFRENCH OPEN DRAWS: Men | Women | Broadcast Schedule\n\nNadal faces a seeded player in the first round of a Slam for the first time in his 68th career Grand Slam singles appearance.\n\nNadal, due to missing most of the last year and a half due to injuries, is unseeded at a Slam for the first time since the 2005 Australian Open.\n\nBeing unseeded meant the record 14-time French Open champion faced the possibility of drawing a seeded player in the first round.\n\nHe drew Zverev, the Tokyo Olympic gold medalist who earlier this month won the Italian Open, the last top-level ATP Tour event before the French Open.\n\nNadal and Zverev last met in the 2022 French Open semifinals.\n\nNadal led that match 7-6 (8), 6-6 when Zverev retired after tearing right ankle ligaments. Zverev missed the rest of the season.\n\nNadal, 37, missed last year's French Open with a left hip flexor injury and underwent surgery last June. In announcing his withdrawal before last year's French Open, Nadal said that he will likely retire in the second half of 2024.\n\nOn Saturday, Nadal said there is \"a big chance\" that this will be his last French Open and that he will make a final decision some time after the tournament.\n\nNadal has played 15 matches since the start of 2023. He went 5-3 over three clay-court tournaments this spring building up to the French Open.\n\nNadal is trying to avoid losing back-to-back matches on clay for the first time since he made his ATP Tour match debut in April 2002, according to Tennis Abstract.\n\nWho will qualify for Paris Olympics in tennis?

The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\" Nadal told an adoring crowd under the Chatrier roof.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon. \"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories. The 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final. His reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease. Nadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net. The Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner. He secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nSwiatek makes strong start\n\nWomen's world number one Iga Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. The Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news",

And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place.\n\nWhen it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk.

I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed.\n\nNadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "brproud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BRPROUD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@brproud.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.brproud.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2024/05/6654bb180ff622.21970312.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1426, "textEnd": 1432}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

a first round defeat to Alexander Zverev.\n\nRAFAEL NADAL'S record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising first round defeat against Alexander Zverev.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on 3 June, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut.\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport.\n\n\"I don't know if this is the last time I will be here, I am not 100% sure but if it is then I wanted to enjoy it,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"The feelings today are difficult to describe in words.\"\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100% keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source":

Taylor Swift played four nights a few miles away earlier this month - a place in the front row for the Eras Tour was probably easier to come by, although not if you know the right people. Within an hour of the draw being made, fellow players were told even their allocation had sold out - but that did not stop Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek finding a way into some choice seats.\n\nThe two men, both of whom will expect to face Zverev later on in this tournament, were largely stoic in their demeanour. Swiatek though, a self-confessed Nadal fan, was unable to show such restraint, covered her mouth in horror when he found himself in trouble.\n\nShe would not have enjoyed the first set then, as Zverev set about taming the hysterical exuberance of the Chatrier atmosphere.\n\nHe did so to great effect, breaking in the very first game of the match and closing out the opening set with a second break after 54 minutes.\n\nBut the overwhelming majority of the 15,000 on court finally found their voice in the second set when the Spanish left-hander gave them cause.\n\nThree Nadal errors had gifted Zverev break points at 1-2, only for his opponent to save both, the second with an ace, and then hold serve. He celebrated winning the game as though it was his 15th title, running towards the net and jumping into the air with fist cocked, a trademark look.\n\nIt rallied the crowd and Nadal himself, who drew rare consecutive errors from Zverev in his next service game and then converted break point for the first time with a perfectly placed drop shot that the German could not run down. The Chatrier roof almost came off.\n\nZverev though is made of sterner stuff. This is not the same player who blew a two-set lead in the 2020 US Open final or at one point lost four grand slam semi-finals in a row. With the Rome title just a week ago, this is a man with renewed confidence in his body and his tennis.\n\nThe world No 4 withstood the onslaught, allowing the crowd to chant at him for a few games, settling back into his service rhythm and then, as Nadal served for the second set, producing sweetly struck baseline winners on both wings to break Nadal to love. What air remained in the stadium was sucked out when Zverev then took the second set in a tie-break.\n\nIt was only the second time in his entire Roland Garros career that Nadal had lost the opening two sets of a match; the other one was in a straight-sets quarter-final defeat to Djokovic nine years ago.\n\nNadal was determined to rage against the dying of the light, drawing first blood in the third set after Zverev offered him a tiny window in which to force a running, passing forehand.\n\nThat ability has not left him, but front-running appears to have done so. Zverev broke straight back - admittedly via a fortuitous framed overhead - and when Nadal produced a costly double-fault in the seventh game of the set, the German pounced.\n\nNadal's fighting spirit could not be faulted, right to the end. He does not know how to give up.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_gray@inews.co.uk", "name": "James Gray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SEI_206380246.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

But Zverev's booming serve, aggressive forehand, and calm under pressure proved too much to overcome after three hours and five minutes.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say,\" Zverev said on court after his win, before handing the mic to the Spanish legend.\n\n\"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a pro, I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment,\" Zverev was quoted as saying by the official Roland Garros website.\n\nThere was so much excitement for the match that Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and WTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek all sat in the stands to take in the action. The encounter was very tightly contested for a straight-sets match, but for every moment in which Nadal seemed to seize the momentum -- rallying the raucous crowd fully behind him -- Zverev found an answer to retake control.\n\nNadal, ranked 275 at the moment, had never played Roland-Garros unseeded, and never faced a top-10 player in the first round. He had also never lost consecutive matches on his beloved clay, but Zverev changed all that with a command performance.\n\nNadal, who fell to 112-4 lifetime at Roland-Garros with the loss, gave his faithful fans plenty to cheer about across the contest, but it was three-time semi-finalist Zverev who held the heavier hand in the key moments as he notched his second clay-court victory over the 22-time Grand Slam champion, and improved to 29-8 lifetime at Porte d'Auteuil.\n\nThunderous chants rang through the bowels of Chatrier with regularity during the pair's 11th meeting, Nadal's feverish fans doing their best to raise the closed roof that covered the court for the entirety of the match. Determined Zverev kept Nadal's faithful from getting too unruly in the early going, however, as he broke Nadal in the first game of the match before wrestling the opening set with a second break of serve at the 50-minute mark, 6-3.\n\nThe second and third sets followed a different path to a similar end.\n\nNadal charged to life in the fourth game of set two, saving a pair of break points for 2-2 and breaking for 3-2 as chants of \"Rafa! Rafa!\" could be heard echoing across the grounds.\n\nUrged on by the faithful, the Spaniard clung to the lead for a spell, but couldn't ward off his determined adversary, who broke at love for 5-5 and eventually claimed a tense tiebreak to take a 2-0 lead.\n\nThere were chances galore for Nadal, which is a testament to just how far he has come since making his return to the tour in April in Barcelona. Though defeated, he left us to wonder what might have been had he had a few more weeks to prepare.\n\nBut Monday's match was Zverev's for the taking, and he braved the magnitude of the contest with aplomb, rising to the occasion and matching the legendary Spaniard whenever the situation called for it.\n\nFaced with another deficit in the third set, Zverev wrestled control from Nadal once again, rallying from 2-0 down, winning six of the final seven games to close out his victory in three hours and five minutes.\n\nIt was a brilliant contest, full of drama, quality, and tension. The only shame, of course, is that such a high-profile contest happened so early in the Paris fortnight. After the match, Nadal was sent off properly by the fans, who chanted his name for several minutes before he took the microphone to address them, and his future plans.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable,\" Nadal said. \"I never dreamed I would be here at almost 38 years old, with all the success I had here, winning so many times - it is something that I never dreamt of.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what will happen in the future. It's a big percentage that I won't be back at Roland-Garros, but I can't say 100 percent. I enjoy playing here, I like traveling with the family, and my body is feeling a little bit better than it did two months ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rallying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design-100.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place.\n\nWhen it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed.\n\nNadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor.

Just like in previous years, the crowd roared ever louder as their hero warmed up, against the backdrop of stadium announcer Marc Maury reading out his incredible list of French Open triumphs.\n\nBut as the match went on against Alexander Zverev, the cheers switched from those of excitement to nervousness, and as it slipped away from Nadal, the crowd tried to will him on.\n\nIf this does prove to be Nadal's final swing at the French Open men's singles title, then he went down fighting against Zverev. Though Nadal has been at pains all week to play down the notion of this fortnight in Paris being a destination on his farewell tour, there was a feeling of finality. His old foe Novak Djokovic was in the crowd. His fans and Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz were there too, not a seat free on this showpiece court at Roland Garros, for a first-round match. They all collectively hoped for one last Nadal hurrah -- just like Serena Williams' fans did at the US Open in 2022.\n\nBut tennis is brutal, and there is little room for sentimentality. For all of Nadal's attempts to claw back into the match, the trumpet fanfares, the red and yellow flags in the crowd, and moments which were inescapably reminiscent of the Nadal of old, there would be no final flourish at Roland Garros. For this year, at least.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself,\" Nadal said. \"I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career, with the dream to come back here. At least I did that. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nEVER SINCE NADAL made his debut here in 2005, winning the men's singles title the same year, this place has become synonymous with him. His record is frankly ridiculous: winning 14 singles titles, a record of 112 wins in 116 matches, translating to a win percentage of 96.5% -- the highest winning percentage of any singles tennis player in a major. He managed to win the 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 tournaments without dropping a set. His defeat to Zverev means Nadal has only ever lost to three men here. Zverev now sits alongside Robin Soderling (fourth round, 2009) and Djokovic (2015 quarterfinals, 2021 semifinals) in having defeated Nadal in Paris.\n\nAll of that has transformed him into this legendary figure, yet the beauty of it is, unlike with many masters, you can still witness his craft: He's still there in front of you, unleashing that famous forehand, complete with the familiar pre-serve setup routine.\n\n\"I consider myself lucky that I'm here, that I can still see him, in the locker room or in the players' restaurant, or seeing him practice with the passion he has -- it's amazing,\" Jannik Sinner said Friday. \"He's for sure the biggest inspiration we have in our sport, no?\" For further evidence of the love that surrounds Nadal, take Alize Cornet's reaction to a good luck message he sent to her ahead of her retirement.\n\nBut whether this is the last time we'll see him in the French Open, only he knows. He has been reluctant to surrender any control over his fortunes here -- even to the extent that he reportedly lobbied to have his first-round match in the afternoon, rather than the showpiece evening slot. Those are his preferred conditions -- less humidity, lighter tennis balls.\n\n\"Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever.\"\n\nFor so long, this seemed likely to be his last hurrah. That was the narrative anyway, ever since he announced in May 2023 that he was pulling out of the French Open (subsequently spending the rest of the year sidelined after hip surgery) and in that same news conference saying 2024 would likely be his \"last year\" on tour.\n\n\"I don't think I deserve to end like this,\" he said at the time, sitting in his tennis academy in Manacor, Spain. He wanted to finish his career on the court one final time, sweaty and exhausted.\n\nThat news conference teed up this season as his farewell tour; it was certainly enough for the organizers of the French Open to plan a goodbye ceremony for Nadal this year. But then came the curveball. On Saturday -- in front of a standing-room-only news conference -- he added his own topspin to the debate over his future. He took control of the narrative: no longer was this a long goodbye, but instead, he opened the door to playing on beyond 2024.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on.\" He added he didn't want to \"close 100% the door,\" saying he was enjoying his tennis, loving having his family with him on tour and still figuring out what his body can handle.\n\nHE CAME TO the French Open in patchy form -- 5-3 on clay this year -- as he recovered from an abdominal injury that cut short his hard-court season at the start of the year. He was forced to sit out Monte Carlo, and his withdrawal sparked concerns he wouldn't be fit in time for Roland Garros. \"My body won't let me [return],\" Nadal said at the time. \"It's getting difficult for me. It's been a difficult year and a half, I'm trying every day.\"\n\nBut he did make it back in time for Barcelona, where he lost in the second round to Alex De Minaur. In Madrid, he faced De Minaur again and won in straight sets, but still, he wasn't sure if his body could manage Paris.\n\n\"It's difficult to understand some things, but for me, Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever,\" Nadal said in Madrid. \"So it is not a thing about losing or winning. It's about going on court there with the feeling that I can fight and I can be competitive and, you know, let's go on court and dream about what can happen.\"\n\nHe'd eventually lose in the round of 16 to Jiri Lehecka, while in Rome he was picked apart by Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in straight sets. All the while, people were saying goodbye to him: At the Madrid Open they unfurled a banner saying \"Gracias Rafa,\" recognizing his five wins there.\n\nBut amid all the nostalgia overload and unpredictable form was a resolute Nadal, focused on adding his 23rd Grand Slam title. A source close to Nadal told ESPN that in the lead-up to the French Open he was training, without pain, three hours a time and was building confidence. He came into the tournament unseeded, ranked 272 in the world, but not one player on the men's draw would have wanted to have drawn him. Alcaraz was asked whether he secretly wanted to draw his hero Nadal in the first round. \"No, honestly,\" he answered, smiling.\n\nThe players are fully aware of the aura around him at Roland Garros. \"You're not playing the statue, you're playing the actual person. But you are playing Rafa Nadal,\" Zverev said before their first-round match. \"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nPlaying Nadal at Roland Garros is as much a mental task as it is skill. \"He has the capability to spin the ball not like other players,\" Daniil Medvedev said. \"Getting these high balls, especially on clay, is not easy. Then we go to where he fights for every point, he brings intensity to every point. You know you're going to be tired, you know it's going to be tough. It's not easy. Rafa will always be Rafa.\"\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas, talking in Monte Carlo in mid-April, summed up what it's like to play Nadal. \"I think he's the ultimate challenge on clay.\"\n\nThat's what it comes back to, that expectation that regardless of what shape he's in or his previous run of form, at Roland Garros, he finds a way to make it work. He came into the 2022 tournament with a 4-2 record on clay that year and ended up winning the whole thing, despite a foot injury.\n\nThe players don't forget moments like that. \"Regardless of the fact that he hasn't played much, he is who he is in Roland Garros,\" Djokovic said.\n\nNADAL WILL FOREVER be a legend at the French Open. It's just a question of whether we'll see him again in this tournament. His old sparring partner certainly hopes so.\n\n\"If he says 'ciao,' he will do it on a court and not on his couch, and I love that because he is very far from being 100%,\" Roger Federer said on the French TV program \"Telematin\" earlier this week. \"I don't know anything, but I would like it to end as he has decided, with his family and his team. I would like him to continue on the circuit a little longer than people believe.\"\n\nThe same goes for Nadal. As he faced a still-packed Court Philippe-Chatrier after his defeat to Zverev, he wasn't ready to say goodbye. He'd just battled for 3 hours 5 minutes against one of the best in-form players in the world right now, and ran him close. Those are the sorts of matches which make it even harder to say goodbye.\n\n\"There's a big percentage I won't be back here, but I can't say 100%,\" Nadal told the crowd. \"The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it's enough, I can't give anything else, but it's something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that's motivation.\"\n\nUp in the audience, his wife, Maria, and son, Rafael, watched on. Nadal is still focusing on the next goal, looking to eke one last bit of magic out of his tiring frame. But regardless of how things end up, whether he calls time after the Olympics, or has one final run at his beloved French Open next year, Nadal looks back with no regrets.\n\n\"I enjoyed everything,\" he said. \"Because of tennis I lived experiences that I never could imagine without practicing, playing this beautiful sport, and I had much more success than what I ever could dream about.\n\n\"So I had injuries, yes. I had tough, low moments, yes. But on the other hand, I enjoyed incredible emotional and positive moments that I am so grateful for, and I feel very lucky for all of that.\"", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType":

His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout.\n\nNadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat.\n\nHis three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\n___\n\nAP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis\n\nHoward Fendrich, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "baytoday.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BayToday.ca"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractable_roof", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retractable roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2024/05/29730b7f-09f3-4b36-9555-36e27c96fc8d.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 746, "textEnd": 752}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It is widely reported that the clay tournament would be the farewell to the 14-time champion Roland Garros and that is certainly what tennis Fans must have thought that as they packed the stands Paris to watch him practice.\n\nIn scenes described as \"crazy\" by fans on social media, around 10,000 fans filled the stands at Court Suzanne Lenglen to watch Nadal take on Denmark's Holger Rune. The Spaniard looked sharp and even though it was just a practice session, the 22-time major winner got the better of Rune after taking the lead 7-5 2-0 in promising signs for his opening match against Alexander Zverev at the French Open.\n\nIt's a brutal draw for Nadal, who will face the in-form world number four, who recently won the Italian Open in preparation for the clay match. Rome was not as fruitful for Nadal, who was blown off the court 6-1 6-3 by world number 9 Hubert Hurkacz in the third round, as he returns to full match fitness after a series of injuries and a surgically repaired injury. hip.\n\nNadal has struggled to get back into shape after his long-awaited return from injury Barcelona, where he lost to Alex de Minaur in the second round. He then took revenge on the Aussie at the Madrid Open before suffering a grueling defeat in the round of 16, before reaching the third round of the Italian Open.\n\nBut the Spaniard admitted his chances of competing in Paris were slim to none and the tennis world expected 2024 to be the last time they would see the king of clay appear at Roland Garros. However, Nadal has been encouraged by his form and fitness in recent weeks and bombastically admitted that this may not be his swan song of the French Open after all, after his practice hit in front of a packed house.\n\n\"In some ways I don't want to close the door on my tennis career 100%,\" he revealed to reporters in Paris. \"Physically I feel better, I'm improving in different ways and I have less limitations than three or four weeks ago. I'm grateful to be able to play at Roland Garros and give myself the opportunity to play here at least one more time - maybe well.\" the latter, perhaps not.\n\n\"I feel competitive in training. I can play against almost anyone. That has given me some hope.\" Nadal is now ranked 276th in the world and has played just 11 matches since January 2023 due to hip and abdominal injuries. And despite expressing doubts after his most recent defeat to Hurkacz in the second round of the Italian Open, Nadal says he has the \"right motivation\" to return to his favorite tournament.\n\nNadal was optimistic in his pre-tournament press conference and despite facing world number 4 Zverev in the first round, he insisted anything was possible. \"If you're not seeded, anything can happen,\" said Nadal, who has won 112 of his 115 matches at Roland Garros. \"That's part of the job if you haven't been placed.

I have to try to be ready.\" The Spaniard's uncle and former former coach Toni Nadal also refused to rule out the astonishing possibility that the 37-year-old - who turns 38 on June 3 - could win a record-breaking 15th title at Roland Garros.\n\nIt will be very difficult because he has not played many games in the last two years, but I think his game will remain very difficult for the opponents,\" he told the BBC. \"If you are not seeded, it is a big problem.

This is the first time that he made an exit in the first round.\n\nSpectators at the Court Philippe-Chatrier witnessed vintage Nadal moments as he played some of his best tennis, especially with his trademark forehand passing shot in a three-hour-and-five-minute match.\n\nZverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under duress proved to be too much to overcome. Talk among tennis fans of this intriguing matchup - a replay of their Paris semifinal from two years back when they played for almost three hours before Zverev was forced to withdraw due to a terrible ankle injury - began as soon as the draw was announced at Roland Garros.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic all sat in the stands to watch the exciting match.\n\nThe match was won in straight sets but every time Nadal appeared to have the upper hand and get the boisterous audience behind him, Zverev came up with a countermove to regain the upper hand.\n\nRain forced the match to be played indoors on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Zverev served heavily and hit a sharp forehand to prevent Nadal from establishing the lead in rallies.\n\nZverev started his highly anticipated first-round Roland Garros blockbuster against Rafael Nadal with aggressive play to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nEarly in the second set, Nadal faced two break points and was well behind at the Court Philippe-Chatrier. However, he managed to escape difficulty and invoked his finest tennis memories to secure a service break. The boisterous crowd erupted in applause for the 37-year-old who was all over the court.\n\nHowever, Zverev maintained his composure and responded when Nadal served to tie the game. The German then took a dominating advantage by playing almost the whole tie-break from the lead.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal dug deeper to come out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break.\n\nIn an attempt to get back into the match, Nadal gave the audience big fist pumps and played some scorching forehand passing shots multiple times during the match. However, the King of Clay suffered his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland Garros.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say. First of all, thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. I don't know what to say. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment, so thank you,\" Zverev said in his on-court interview, as quoted by ATP.\n\nOn the same court, the two faced off in the semi-finals two years ago. Before the second set had ended, and more than three hours into the match, Zverev sustained a terrible ankle injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the 2022 season. It looked like a duel made to be remembered. Afterwards, Nadal won his fourteenth Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nNadal struggled with a couple of injuries over the past couple of years and had a tally of 5-3 record this clay-court season heading into the French Open 2024.\n\nBefore this match, the Spaniard hadn't competed on Court Philippe-Chatrier since winning there in 2022.

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

As he prepares for his 19th tournament at Roland Garros in Paris, he has won the title 14 times in his career.\n\nHowever, no player can go on forever, and it is clear that Nadal is getting near the end. He has not made any official retirement announcement, but there is a very good chance that Nadal's appearance in the 2024 French Open will be his last.\n\nThe 37-year-old Nadal brings a lifetime record of 112-3 at Roland-Garros into this year's tournament. The only players he has lost to in Paris include Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling.\n\nHe says he is enjoying playing tennis once again, but he knows that it will be a major challenge to get back in the winner's circle in Paris.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland-Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on - I hope you understand,\" he said.\n\n\"In some way I don't want to close 100 percent the do. First thing, I am enjoying playing tennis. Second thing, I am traveling with the family. They are enjoying. I am enjoying sharing all this process with them.\"\n\nNadal will have a difficult path in French Open\n\nThis is not the usual path for Nadal at the French Open. He is not a seeded player this year, and that means he has a challenging draw. He will face fourth-seed Alexander Zverev in the opening round, and that means his play in Paris could be very short.\n\nHowever, he has a 5-1 record on clay against Zverev and he has a 7-3 record overall against the German star.\n\nRafael Nadal comes into the French Open after a painful showing in the Italian Open in Rome. He was non-competitive against Hubert Hurkacz earlier this month, dropping a 6-1, 6-3 decision.\n\n\"Of course on paper it is not the best draw,\" Nadal said. \"I play against one of the toughest opponents possible, and at the same time, he came here winning the last event and it's a Masters 1000. That's the draw. Just try to be ready for it.\n\n\"You know, it's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go out and repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic won the French Open last year, and he is also the top-seeded player in this year's event.

I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts.\n\n\"But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\nUnseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros.\n\nBut Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd.\n\nThe Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not \"close the door\" on a return to the Paris showpiece.\n\nIt seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nNadal added: \"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no? I think if that's the last time that I'm gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it's normal.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.\"\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nZverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world.

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what\u00b4s going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but - hey, here's a twist - he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal, adresses the media after losing against Germany's Alexander Zverev during their first round match of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris, Monday, May 27, 2024. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That\u00b4s why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what\u00b4s driving me ... I\u00b4m a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I\u00b4m in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family - particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet - some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don\u00b4t know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see - I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let\u00b4s make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That\u00b4s my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he\u00b4s going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let\u00b4s see if I am able to keep going or I say, \u00b4OK, guys, it\u00b4s more than enough.' Let\u00b4s see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\u00b4s tennis writer since 2002.

But ... because he doesn\u00b4t know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we\u00b4re not going to do it this year. That\u00b4s his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nSpain's Rafael Nadal looks up during a training session at the Roland Garros stadium, Saturday, May 25, 2024 in Paris. The French Open tennis tournament starts Sunday May 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Jean-Francois Badias)\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it\u00b4s appropriate. In this case, it\u00b4s unfortunate how that happened, but I don\u00b4t know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn\u00b4t be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It\u00b4d be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn\u00b4t do,\" Zverev said. \"That\u00b4s, at the end of the day, what\u00b4s going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn\u00b4t finished and there isn\u00b4t a decision, he\u00b4s considered innocent and so that\u00b4s why he\u00b4s allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP\u00b4s tennis writer since 2002.

Now two years later, the result was very different.\n\nNadal fell in straight sets - 6-4, 7-6, 6-3 - in a grueling three-hour match that the 14-time French Open winner said would likely be his final match at Roland Garros. He finishes with a record of 112 wins and four losses\n\nHe was still Rafa, but muted. A little slower than we remember. A little heavier in the feet. The shots that used to fall so artfully on the line were now a few centimeters wide.\n\nIt wasn't until the fifth game of the first set that Nadal started to really look like himself. He finally began hitting the ball with authority, attacking instead of constantly reacting, and using the entire court to challenge Zverev.\n\nBut it just wasn't enough. Nadal has 112 career wins at Roland Garros, but we may have reached the point where that experience is a burden and no longer an advantage. He has 10 years on the 27-year-old Zverev, and a long history of foot, hip and abdominal injuries. He's already dealt with hip and abdominal issues this season, which is one of the reasons Nadal looked tentative on Monday.\n\nFlashes of the real Rafa were there. He could still hit the ball into impossible corners and create shots that no human could hope to return. Those moments were infrequent, but they were there.\n\nAnd those moments built a foundation for Nadal to stand on in the second set. Down 2-1, he caught fire, finally unearthing his cross-court backhand and winning five points in a row for the first time in the match. He won the game to even the set at 2-2, jumping with delight while the capacity crowd at Philippe Chatrier delivered a deafening response. The audience was even louder when he won his second straight game to break Zverev for the first time.\n\nNadal fought back in the third set, thrilling the spectators at Court Philippe-Chatrier. But Zverev's constant pressure wore Nadal down and he finally succumbed.\n\nWith an admiring crowd giving an adoring cheer for Nadal, Zverev was gracious in speaking after the match, ceding the moment to his renowned opponent.\n\n\"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" he said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and was lucky enough to play him when I turned professional. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment.

The anticipation around the clash between Nadal and Zverev has already reached sky-high, specifically with the odds against the Spaniard due to his low ranking and his long absence from major grand slams due to recurring injuries. The video was uploaded from the US Open's official social media handle, where the 37-year-old was seen preparing his racquet after a gym session ahead of his big game.\n\nNadal made his debut at Roland Garros all the way back in 2005 and went on to win the French Open a record 14 times. Ever since the announcement of the matchups, there has been increased tension amongst Nadal's massive fanbase for his intense first-round setup. However, Nadal has always maintained his eagerness to just focus on the game rather than concentrating on the outcome against the German.\n\nFrench Open 2024, Day 2: Order of play\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal told in a press-conference.\n\n\"But in my mind is something different. Play much better and give myself a chance to be competitive... I didn't play this level of opponents, being competitive since a super-long time,\" Nadal added.\n\nNadal suffered a straight defeat to Hubert Hurkacz in a high-class second-round clash at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on May 11, by a staggering 6-1, 6-3 margin. Many have already speculated the defeat to have called time on Nadal's illustrious career at the Rome ATP Masters 1000.\n\nWith increased speculation of this being Nadal's last dance at Roland Garros, the Spaniard marked an end to the floating rumours by explaining how he plans to keep the doors open for a return in 2025.\n\n\"If I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand...I don't want to close 100% the door, because it's a very simple thing. First, I'm enjoying playing tennis,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going'. But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one,\" Nadal added.\n\nThe first-round match between Nadal and Zverev at the French Open will not start before 7 pm on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/rafael-nadal-203246469-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=HtBTUBuO6IZMSMccfLR.GCx0MDmwNG7r", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 254, "textEnd": 260}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1595, "textEnd": 1601}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

I think he beats 90% of the draw today. There's only a few guys that would beat him playing this well.\n\n\"And Zverev was the worst opponent possible in the first round, worse that playing Djokovic, worse than playing Alcaraz. Also the circumstances, it's indoor, cold outside, the ball doesn't travel.\n\n\"So I think all that, and still being so close, it's all positive for Rafa. And with that passion, why not [come back]? He knows how to win big matches on this court.\"\n\nFormer world No 4 Henman lauded Nadal's mental approach to the sport and expressed his hope that the 22-time Grand Slam champion will continue playing.\n\n\"Uncle Toni said to him when he was a six-year-old you try your best on every shot on every point and you run after every ball until it's bounced twice. He obviously took that on board for his professional career,\" he reflected.\n\n\"There have been times when he's been frustrated with a shot or with the umpire but it's never affected him on the next point.\n\n\"That mental strength, mental fortitude is one the strongest attributes in all of sport and to see him out there playing with that passion and belief is so special for everyone to see. I'd love to see him back out there because Rafa Nadal can still do some damage.\"\n\nRead More: Rafael Nadal reacts to Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz watching his French Open defeat\n\nSix-time Major winner Boris Becker, however, feels Nadal has played his last match at the French Open.\n\n\"I believe that Rafa will still play the Olympics at Roland Garros,\" Becker said. \"But I don't think he'll play the French Open again in 2025.\n\n\"Of course he has emotions and probably had a sleepless night because he didn't know whether it would be the last time.

I hope you understand,\" said the Spaniard.\n\nNadal, who will celebrate his 38th birthday on June 3, faces world number four Alexander Zverev in the first round in Paris on Monday.\n\nThe Spanish legend has racked up 112 wins in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning 2005 debut when he was just 19.\n\nHe has 22 Grand Slam titles -- second only to Novak Djokovic's 24 on the all-time men's list -- but his career has been plagued by injuries.\n\nNadal has played just four tournaments since January last year after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear.\n\nAs a result, his ranking has slumped to 276 in the world and he comes into the French Open unseeded.\n\n\"I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, but I feel better now,\" he added.\n\n\"I have fewer limitations than three, four weeks ago, without a doubt.\"\n\nNadal had to sit out the 2023 French Open through injury.\n\nThe year before he won his 14th title but revealed that he could only play with daily pain-killing injections in his feet.\n\n\"So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, okay, it's enough, I can't keep going, but today in some way I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one.\n\n\"I feel competitive in training. Maybe not in an official match, but when I enter the court, I feel like I can beat anyone,\" he said.\n\nNadal holds a 7-3 winning record over Zverev.\n\nFive of those victories came on clay including a semi-final triumph at Roland Garros in 2022 when the German was forced to quit with ankle ligament damage.\n\nIn Paris so far this week, Nadal has practised in front of packed courts.\n\nHe hit with fellow former champion Stan Wawrinka who described Nadal as \"strong as ever\".\n\nFifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev, who trained with him on Thursday, said he was happy not to face him in the first round.\n\n\"This place is magical for me. If in the bottom of my heart, I didn't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I would not be here in front of you guys,\" added Nadal.\n\n\"So I still have the motivation and a small, at least is a small hope to play well.\"\n\nAnd if 2024 turns out to be Nadal's French Open farewell?\n\n\"I just can say thanks to all the love I received from all the players, from the organisers, from the tournaments, from all the community of tennis and sport.\n\n\"I feel very proud that probably I leave a positive legacy there.\"\n\nFrench veteran Gael Monfils, who is also 37 and first played Nadal in 2005, said: \"we should enjoy it as much as we can\".\n\n\"I wonder if we're not going back to traditional tournaments as they were played a long time ago, because the last 20 years are not run-of-the-mill normal years,\" added Monfils of two decades dominated by Nadal, Novak Djokovic and the now-retired Roger Federer.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga\u00ebl_Monfils", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ga\u00ebl Monfils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 570, "textEnd": 576}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Visit image gallery to purchase the image.\n\nRafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after crashing to a straight sets loss, 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3, against fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday (local time).\n\n\"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris when he'll turn 38.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nNever far from physical issues in his glittering career, Nadal missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nNadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio. He had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of Roland Garos.\n\nThe 22-Grand-Slam winner said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nIn other first round matches, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\nIn the women's matches, Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title in Paris, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in the French capital following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType":

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nRafael Nadal has owned the clay court at Roland Garros throughout his career, but in what could be his final appearance in the French Open, he lost in the first round in straight sets.\n\nAlexander Zverev, the No. 4-ranked men's tennis player in the world, took down the Spanish legend that is Nadal, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3, to move on to the second round.\n\nNadal, 37, was unsure if he would be competing in the tournament last month as he's continuously battled injuries while trying to extend his illustrious career, which includes 22 Grand Slam titles. He's won the French Open 14 times, owning an outstanding career record of 112-4 after the loss to Zverev.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nZverev is just the third tennis player ever to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, as Novak Djokovic did it twice - both in the final in 2015 and 2021 - and Robin S\u00f6derling in 2009 in the fourth round.\n\nThe emotions for Nadal were understandably high after the match, as the crowd roared despite his quick exit.\n\nRAFAEL NADAL, 37, DISMISSES NOTION THIS IS HIS LAST FRENCH OPEN: 'DON'T ASSUME THAT'\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk,\" he said after saluting the crowd in French. \"I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. But if it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\n\n\"The crowd has been amazing during the whole week of preparation and today. Yeah, the feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. But, for me, it's so special to feel the love from people in the place I love the most.\"\n\nWhile Zverev dominated the match as a whole, there were vintage \"Rafa\" moments throughout, including an incredible forehand on the run after a Zverev overhand that should've resulted in a point. Instead, Nadal shot it back down the line and the crowd roared with the lefty having a chance to come back as the third set was tied 3-3 at the time.\n\nZverev was a gentleman after the match as well, giving Nadal his flowers as he explained the emotions for him going into the match.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say,\" the 27-year-old Zverev began. \"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became professional.

But Zverev's booming serve, aggressive forehand, and calm under pressure proved too much to overcome after three hours and five minutes.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say,\" Zverev said on court after his win, before handing the mic to the Spanish legend.\n\n\"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a pro, I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment,\" Zverev was quoted as saying by the official Roland Garros website.\n\nThere was so much excitement for the match that Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and WTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek all sat in the stands to take in the action. The encounter was very tightly contested for a straight-sets match, but for every moment in which Nadal seemed to seize the momentum -- rallying the raucous crowd fully behind him -- Zverev found an answer to retake control.\n\nNadal, ranked 275 at the moment, had never played Roland-Garros unseeded, and never faced a top-10 player in the first round. He had also never lost consecutive matches on his beloved clay, but Zverev changed all that with a command performance.\n\nNadal, who fell to 112-4 lifetime at Roland-Garros with the loss, gave his faithful fans plenty to cheer about across the contest, but it was three-time semi-finalist Zverev who held the heavier hand in the key moments as he notched his second clay-court victory over the 22-time Grand Slam champion, and improved to 29-8 lifetime at Porte d'Auteuil.\n\nThunderous chants rang through the bowels of Chatrier with regularity during the pair's 11th meeting, Nadal's feverish fans doing their best to raise the closed roof that covered the court for the entirety of the match. Determined Zverev kept Nadal's faithful from getting too unruly in the early going, however, as he broke Nadal in the first game of the match before wrestling the opening set with a second break of serve at the 50-minute mark, 6-3.\n\nThe second and third sets followed a different path to a similar end.\n\nNadal charged to life in the fourth game of set two, saving a pair of break points for 2-2 and breaking for 3-2 as chants of \"Rafa! Rafa!\" could be heard echoing across the grounds.\n\nUrged on by the faithful, the Spaniard clung to the lead for a spell, but couldn't ward off his determined adversary, who broke at love for 5-5 and eventually claimed a tense tiebreak to take a 2-0 lead.\n\nThere were chances galore for Nadal, which is a testament to just how far he has come since making his return to the tour in April in Barcelona. Though defeated, he left us to wonder what might have been had he had a few more weeks to prepare.\n\nBut Monday's match was Zverev's for the taking, and he braved the magnitude of the contest with aplomb, rising to the occasion and matching the legendary Spaniard whenever the situation called for it.\n\nFaced with another deficit in the third set, Zverev wrestled control from Nadal once again, rallying from 2-0 down, winning six of the final seven games to close out his victory in three hours and five minutes.\n\nIt was a brilliant contest, full of drama, quality, and tension. The only shame, of course, is that such a high-profile contest happened so early in the Paris fortnight. After the match, Nadal was sent off properly by the fans, who chanted his name for several minutes before he took the microphone to address them, and his future plans.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable,\" Nadal said. \"I never dreamed I would be here at almost 38 years old, with all the success I had here, winning so many times - it is something that I never dreamt of.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what will happen in the future. It's a big percentage that I won't be back at Roland-Garros, but I can't say 100 percent. I enjoy playing here, I like traveling with the family, and my body is feeling a little bit better than it did two months ago.\"", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rallying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rallying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Contests", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405273167667.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\n- Zverev's fast start -\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked

It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\"\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, has previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.\n\nThe seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent\n\n- long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's No 1 and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd.\n\nA slow start cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nHis celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, came into the French Open unseeded for the first time and saw his career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament fall to 112-4.\n\nHis three other losses came against Soderling in 2010 and twice against Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nItalian world No 2 Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks 6-3 6-3 6-4.\n\nSinner, the Australian Open champion, withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed Rome with a hip injury, but was back on form at Roland Garros as Eubanks exited at the first hurdle for the second successive

The former World No. 1 Nadal suffered his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland Garros.\n\nParis [France], May 27 (ANI): Paris [France], May 27 (ANI): Rafael Nadal, the 14-time French Open champion, gave his all in what might be his final appearance in the French Open but fell prey to the sharp forehand aggressive play of Alexander Zverev as he lost 3-6, 6-7(4), 3-6 in the blockbuster opening round clash on Monday.\n\nNadal, the former World No. 1, suffered a first-round defeat at Roland Garros. This is the first time that he made an exit in the first round.\n\nAlso Read | On Which Channel ICC T20 World Cup 2024 Will Be Telecast Live in India? How to Watch Free Live Streaming Online of Men's Twenty20 WC?.\n\nSpectators at the Court Philippe-Chatrier witnessed vintage Nadal moments as he played some of his best tennis, especially with his trademark forehand passing shot in a three-hour-and-five-minute match.\n\nZverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under duress proved to be too much to overcome. Talk among tennis fans of this intriguing matchup - a replay of their Paris semifinal from two years back when they played for almost three hours before Zverev was forced to withdraw due to a terrible ankle injury - began as soon as the draw was announced at Roland Garros.\n\nAlso Read | IPL 2024 Award Winners List: Orange Cap, Purple Cap and Recipients of Other Honours After KKR vs SRH Final.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic all sat in the stands to watch the exciting match.\n\nThe match was won in straight sets but every time Nadal appeared to have the upper hand and get the boisterous audience behind him, Zverev came up with a countermove to regain the upper hand.\n\nRain forced the match to be played indoors on Court Philippe-Chatrier, where Zverev served heavily and hit a sharp forehand to prevent Nadal from establishing the lead in rallies.\n\nZverev started his highly anticipated first-round Roland Garros blockbuster against Rafael Nadal with aggressive play to take a 6-3 lead.\n\nEarly in the second set, Nadal faced two break points and was well behind at the Court Philippe-Chatrier. However, he managed to escape difficulty and invoked his finest tennis memories to secure a service break. The boisterous crowd erupted in applause for the 37-year-old who was all over the court.\n\nHowever, Zverev maintained his composure and responded when Nadal served to tie the game. The German then took a dominating advantage by playing almost the whole tie-break from the lead.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal dug deeper to come out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break.\n\nIn an attempt to get back into the match, Nadal gave the audience big fist pumps and played some scorching forehand passing shots multiple times during the match. However, the King of Clay suffered his first-ever first-round defeat at Roland Garros.\n\n\"To be honest I don't know what to say. First of all, thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. I don't know what to say. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment, so thank you,\" Zverev said in his on-court interview, as quoted by ATP.\n\nOn the same court, the two faced off in the semi-finals two years ago. Before the second set had ended, and more than three hours into the match, Zverev sustained a terrible ankle injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the 2022 season. It looked like a duel made to be remembered. Afterwards, Nadal won his fourteenth Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nNadal struggled with a couple of injuries over the past couple of years and had a tally of 5-3 record this clay-court season heading into the French Open 2024.\n\nBefore this match, the Spaniard hadn't competed on Court Philippe-Chatrier since winning there in 2022.

Fans streamed through the gates, packing Roland Garros, lining up for crepes and champagne and Aperol spritzes. Grand slam champions played -- Alcaraz, Osaka, Ostapenko -- and came away with victories, even Osaka, who nearly gave away her match twice, squandering a 4-0 lead in the third set before beating Lucia Bronzetti 6-1, 4-6, 7-5. The defending champion, Novak Djokovic arrived.\n\nAnd yet it all felt like a prelude, a kind overture before the real business of the competition takes place, as though there will be two events happening during, just as there were during what was likely Serena Williams' final U.S. Open in 2022. There was the run of an all-time great, however long it might last, and then the business of a championship, two narratives that didn't figure to coalesce, then or now.\n\nWhen Rafael Nadal is in the draw here, it does not truly start until he takes the court. The lines were 40-deep to get into Court Suzanne Lenglen even on Saturday afternoon, before the tournament began in earnest.\n\nThere were similar queues to get a solo picture with the 10-foot steel statue of Nadal which stands just east of Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nHis name is on nearly everyone's lips, uber tennis fans and Uber drivers alike. If that latter court is his living room, then the grounds at Roland Garros are his estate.\n\nUnfortunately, tomorrow (Monday) brings the very real threat of Nadal getting kicked off his property by sundown, possibly for the last time, by arguably the most in-form clay-courter, and most controversial player, in tennis right now.\n\nThat would be Alexander Zverev, winner of the Italian Open last Sunday, ranked fourth in the world, facing a trial on charges of domestic abuse later this week (he denies them).\n\nZverev is a big and fast prototype of new-age 2020s tennis. How does someone 6ft 6in (198cm) tall, with the build of an NBA shooting guard, move that effortlessly across a tennis court, especially after tearing three ligaments in his ankle, against Nadal of all people, in their semi-final here two years ago?\n\n\"On paper, is not the best draw,\" Nadal said Saturday, with a gallows humour-style smile. \"What can I do? That's the draw. Just try to be ready for it.\"\n\nNadal, who has won this tournament 14 times, was ready two years ago, playing the best tennis of this twilight period of his career that has now likely entered its sunset. He'd won the year's first Grand Slam in Australia and, after some bumps during the clay-court season, he was rounding into his usual Roland Garros form, despite having to get painkilling injections in his foot before each match.\n\nBut Zverev was giving him fits until that violent ankle-roll. They had played for three hours and still hadn't finished the second set, with Nadal leading 7-6, 6-6 on a sweaty, humid afternoon where the roof was closed because of thunderstorms. He was getting so many balls back on a day when the slow, heavy conditions and Zverev's quickness and seemingly endless arms made it difficult for Nadal to pound the ball through the court like he's done since 2005.\n\nEver since then, Zverev has wanted another shot at playing Nadal at Roland Garros -- though not in the first round, more like a semifinal or a final.\n\nThe idea of playing Nadal on this clay sends chills through the spines of so many players. Not Zverev, because that is the way his brain works and because he knows how his weapons have long caused the Spaniard serious problems. He had won three of their past four meetings before that 2022 semi-final.\n\n\"I didn't want my last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court on a wheelchair,\" Zverev said Saturday.\n\nZverev said he had just finished what he described as a terrific practice with Andrey Rublev when his brother, Misha, who is one of his coaches, arrived with news of the draw. He thought Misha was punking him, then quickly realized he wasn't.\n\n\"You never want to play Rafa at Roland Garros. I don't think anyone would like to play Rafa in the first round here,\" world No 9 Stefanos Tsitsipas says. \"He can still find a way to make it work on Philippe-Chatrier.\"\n\nFor nearly two decades, Nadal has made the bulk of his living on a single maneuver -- hunting for any chance he can find to hit that bull-whip forehand across the court into a right-handed player's backhand. The shot -- so heavy, so much topspin -- strikes the ground and takes off to eye level for most players. It nearly drove Roger Federer mad in the late 2000s, so much so that he remodelled his entire backhand.\n\nZverev, though, has a better backhand than forehand, and he is so tall he can still get on top of a ball spitting at him like a snake from Nadal's racket. He can't do it every time, and it's not as though he is able to neutralize Nadal's version of the cruise missile. But he can do it enough to extend rallies longer than a lot of other players can.\n\nFactor in Nadal's injuries - hip surgery, abdominal muscle strains - that have taken some of the punch out of his best shot, and this looks like an ugly afternoon for the soon to be 38-year-old, even if he said he has felt better this week than he has all spring, since this latest comeback began last month in Barcelona.\n\n\"I wanted to have that process months ago and start with the feeling that I have today in Monte Carlo, but you can't manage what you can't manage,\" Nadal said. \"Things went like this, and here we are.\"\n\nYes, here they are, in a place that Nadal has described as \"magical\" for him, where his presence looms so large, where nearly every player who isn't playing or practising when he is will have their eyes fixed on this match, And like most of the 15,000 fans packing the stadium, and the tens of thousands more watching on the big screens across the Roland Garros grounds, they will be pulling for him.\n\n\"I'm going to be rooting for Rafa, sorry,\" said Iga Swiatek, the women's world No 1, a self-described Nadal freak.\n\nAnd this is where maybe the biggest challenges will come for Zverev -- dealing with a hostile crowd, and having to constantly remind himself to play the ball and the version of the man that is standing on the other side of the net, rather than the statue standing outside, so to speak, as impossible as that might seem.\n\n\"You are playing the statue,\" he acknowledges. \"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\n\n\"There's always been discussion. In 2022, I remember he came into Roland Garros not winning Monte Carlo, not winning Madrid, not winning Rome. He came into this tournament, and everybody was like, 'Oh, he's a big question mark, he's this and that'. He came and dominated the entire tournament.\"\n\nYes, and no.\n\nFelix Auger-Aliassime took him to five sets in the round of 16 that year. He and Novak Djokovic had a four-set battle in the quarterfinal that was a few points away from going to a fifth. Nadal is now two years older, significantly more banged up, and as he put it, just starting to feel like he can play without worrying about the consequences each shot will have on his body.\n\nFor his part, Zverev is playing some of the best tennis of his life, and certainly the best since coming back from that ankle injury early last year.\n\nHis serve, always a massive shot but prone to cracking in tight spots, is getting into the territory of Hubert Hurkacz, currently the best server in men's tennis, according to the advanced tennis statistics compiled by TennisViz, which rates shots on speed and placement. His forehand is among the best of the French Open's top 16 seeds by those same metrics. He is moving as though he was never injured.\n\nNadal and his camp know what he is up against, but he's not ready to give up yet.\n\nHe even suggested on Saturday that this French Open might not be his last. He promised earlier in the month he would not have bothered to come to this tournament at all if his body prevented him from dreaming of what might be possible, that his career sunset might somehow end up being one of those giant, bright orange fireballs that gleam as it drops toward the horizon.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

NBC and streaming service Peacock begin their Monday coverage of the French Open at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nEuropean viewers can catch the action on Eurosport, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA tough path to 15\n\nNadal has won Roland Garros 14 times - the most of any player by a comfortable margin - and possesses an incredible 112-3 record at the tournament.\n\n\"You win it five times, that's a lot,\" tennis great Boris Becker recently told CNN Sport. \"You win it 10 times, it's impossible. Nadal's won it 14 times. I don't know any other record in any other sport that equals that.\"\n\nCurrently blocking his path towards an unthinkable 15th title though is former world No. 2 Zverev, widely tipped as one of the favorites to win the tournament in Paris.\n\nThe German is a proficient clay court player and is fresh off winning his sixth Masters 1000 title in Rome earlier this month. He has struggled against Nadal in the past, however, holding a 3-7 record against the legendary Spaniard. The last meeting between the pair came in the French Open semifinals in 2022, where Zverev suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year.\n\nThough speculation remains rampant that this could be the last time Nadal appears at Roland Garros as an active player, the 22-time grand slam singles champion told the media that he was not willing to close the door on competing in 2025.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not because I cannot predict what's going on - I hope you understand,\" he said ahead of the tournament.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_joseph@aol.com", "name": "Sam Joseph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

And why is he unseeded?", "body": "Rafael Nadal will start his French Open campaign against Alexander Zverev. AP\n\nRafael Nadal will not be getting a farewell ceremony at Roland Garros this year. The tournament organisers had planned a farewell ceremony for the record 14-time winner but they have now shunned the idea because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But &mldr; because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 6 PM IST.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Products and Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Nadal-vs-Zverev1-2024-05-d0429e61c4d2c917d75c874772d2dad2-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1325, "textEnd": 1331}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semifinal match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nMeanwhile, Coco Gauff made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=bfb64931-2fe6-55a5-bdd6-35528789a366&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84428&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.03377.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 860, "textEnd": 866}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Tennis legend unsure about future", "body": "Let's get this part out of the way: Rafael Nadal did not announce his retirement after exiting the French Open in the first round.\n\nNothing else, though, is entirely clear about what comes next for the owner of 22 Grand Slam titles. He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that.

CHIEF Minister Datuk Seri Panglima Hajiji Noor's 2021 Hala Tuju Sabah Maju Jaya Plan and the Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA) have laid out a road map to an exciting future for all Sabahans, with a target of increasing Sabah's income levels and GDP per capita from about RM 23,000 to about RM 40,000 by 2030. Read more \"If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNadal, an Olympic singles gold medallist in Beijing in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: \"That's my main goal now.\n\n\"I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\"\n\nHe won't make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury.\n\nIn his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010.\n\n\"It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\n- 'Thank you Rafa' -\n\nZverev said it had been \"a great honour\" to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment,\" said the German star.\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nHowever, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal's 34.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.\n\nStay up-to-date by following Daily Express's Telegram channel.\n\nDaily Express Malaysia\n\n* Follow us on Instagram and join our Telegram and/or WhatsApp channel(s) for the latest news you don't want to miss.\n\n* Do you have access to the Daily Express e-paper and online exclusive news?

You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland-Garros.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nNadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.\n\nHe had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what was probably his final French Open.\n\n\"Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I had my chances... I mean, I wasn't that far. That's my feeling. That's probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that.\n\n\"Of course, disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I'm happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\"\n\nNadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grass court season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now, I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feeling is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nFans were left wondering if the 14-times champion would return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades.\n\nThe 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour.\n\nHaving returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier, but he ultimately went down fighting.\n\n\"I'm not 100% sure if it's the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd were amazing during the whole week of preparation and today,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland-Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semifinals.\n\n\"I don't know what to say ... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it's such a great honour,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.\"\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier.\n\nFaced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland-Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nWatched by his great rival Novak Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level

And why is he unseeded? | Sports-Games", "body": "The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.Tournament director Amlie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didnt want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.As you can imagine, we had something planned for him.\n\nThe French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,'' she continued. ''And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\" Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev: Why are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?Despite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded? This is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\" What difference do seedings make?Players who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?Players tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\" Who is Alexander Zverev? He is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,'' Zverev said. ''That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\" Why is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?Mauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1692, "textEnd": 1698}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

This is the main event. A total of 128 players compete for the men's championship. A total of 256 singles players participate in both the men's and women's tournaments combined. No first-round match packs as much drama, intrigue, or star power as this clash between Nadal, a 14-time French Open champion, and Zverev, who has played in a major final and reached multiple major semifinals. It is remarkable to get a matchup this good and this interesting in the first round.\n\nThe enormity of the match is magnified by the fact that Nadal is considering retirement as soon as this year. He hasn't made any official announcement about exactly when he will call it a career, but the end does seem closer and not far away. Nadal's body has been unforgiving in recent years, especially over the past several months. Nadal has barely played. He just lacks the explosiveness and force any athlete needs in order to be supremely competitive. Nadal has pushed his body very hard, and to be clear, he has squeezed every last ounce of potential from it for roughly 20 years. He has actually lasted longer -- and played better for a longer period of time -- than many critics and analysts thought he would. He didn't burn out at age 30 or 31 the way many other tennis players have done in the past. He was still a vital, formidable and relevant presence in men's tennis at age 36. He greatly exceeded expectations in that regard. Now, though, it seems the tank is running on empty.\n\nCan Nadal summon up enough energy and cleverness to outfox Zverev, a younger and stronger player in his physical prime? We will all get to find out. Zverev does have a deserved reputation as a player who can and will get nervous. Nadal will need Zverev to play a shaky and wobbly match in order to win.\n\nHere are the Alexander Zverev-Rafael Nadal French Open odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nFrench Open Odds: Alexander Zverev-Rafael Nadal Odds\n\nTime: 8:30 a.m. ET / 5:30 a.m. PT (depending on length of previous match on court; 25 minutes after previous match)\n\n*Watch Alexander Zverev vs Rafael Nadal LIVE on fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\n\nWhy Alexander Zverev Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe spread of 5.5 games for this match means that if Zverev wins three sets by two or more games, he will cover. If Zverev wins 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, he covers. If he wins 7-5, 7-5, 6-4, he covers. Basically, if Zverev wins in straight sets and doesn't need a tiebreaker to win any of the three sets, he covers. That's realistic.\n\nWhy Rafael Nadal Could Cover The Spread\n\nIf Nadal can force at least one tiebreaker, and if he can keep the other two sets within two games, he will cover the spread. If Nadal loses 7-6, 6-4, 7-5, he covers. If he loses 6-4, 6-4, 7-6, he covers. That's realistic, given that Zverev might be nervous and could keep Nadal in this match.\n\nFinal Alexander Zverev-Rafael Nadal Prediction & Pick\n\nThe best bet here is total games for Zverev. Unless he dominates, Zverev will probably lose at least one set. If this match goes four sets, Zverev is likely to wear down Nadal and ultimately win. In a four-set scenario, Zverev is almost certain to win more than 20.5 games. If you think the match will end in straight sets, don't bet on this, but if you're convinced Nadal will win at least one set, Zverev total games and the over is the right play.\n\nFinal Alexander Zverev-Rafael Nadal Prediction & Pick: Zverev over 20.5 games", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Alexander-Zverev-vs.-Rafael-Nadal-French-Open-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

and 14 titles - at Roland Garros.\n\nBut while Nadal's mind may still be willing, the body currently isn't, and it was always going to be tough for him to make an impact this year.\n\nAfter a round-one loss to Alexander Zverev, we look at the four rare occasions Nadal has been defeated at this event.\n\nThe first of Nadal's French Open losses was arguably the most shocking of them all.\n\nNadal was a perfect four from four at Roland Garros heading into the 2009 event, and after reaching the fourth round few expected 23rd seed Soderling to trouble him.\n\nBut the Swede - who would ultimately reach back-to-back finals at the tournament in 2009 and 2010 - pulled off one of the greatest upsets in tennis history.\n\nAfter winning the opening set emphatically, it looked like the Swede's chances were over after the world No 1 and top seed rallied to level at one-set-all.\n\nSoderling was unfazed, however, and reeled off the next two sets to claim a stunning 6-2, 6-7(2), 6-4, 7-6(2) triumph and end Nadal's 31-match streak.\n\nAfter his 2009 loss, the 14-time winner rebounded to win five consecutive titles from 2010-14.\n\nBut he was struggling with form and fitness heading into the 2015 edition and was ultimately beaten by great rival Djokovic.\n\nThe Serbian was 0-6 against Nadal at the French Open prior to this match, and it looked as if nerves were getting to him after he wasted an early lead.\n\nBut the world No 1 righted the ship and after eventually claiming the opener, he stormed to a 7-5, 6-3, 6-1 quarter-final win.\n\nDjokovic is the only man in history to beat Nadal at the tournament twice after a stunning win in the last four in 2021.\n\nNadal came into this event having won four straight titles in Paris - and having beaten Djokovic comprehensively in the 2020 final.\n\nBut, after dropping the opening set, the Serbian responded with a sublime second set, and edged an extraordinary third set to move close to victory.\n\nWith Nadal struggling physically and fading, Djokovic claimed a 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-2 triumph on his way to winning a second title.\n\nThe draw Gods were not kind to Nadal in what could be his final Roland Garros, with Zverev - the Italian Open winner - seeded fourth in Paris.\n\nNadal had the vast majority of Court Philippe Chatrier behind him and fought tooth and nail to try and claim victory, but the German was always the favourite.\n\nAnd the world No 4 claimed a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory to reach the second round, handing Nadal loss No four at the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F23210052%2FRafael-Nadal-during-a-practice-session-ahead-of-the-2024-French-Open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

This marked Nadal's first-ever first-round defeat at the French Open.\n\nDespite the loss, Nadal expressed his motivation to continue his illustrious career, particularly eyeing a match in the upcoming Paris Olympics. After his defeat to Zverev, the fans at Court Philippe-Chatrier gave Nadal a warm send-off, chanting his name for several minutes before he addressed them and discussed his future plans. The audience witnessed vintage Nadal moments, with the champion delivering his best tennis, especially his trademark forehand passing shot, during the three-hour and five-minute match.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable. I never dreamed I would be here at almost 38 years old, with all the success I had here, winning so many times - it is something that I never dreamt of,\" Nadal said as quoted by Roland Garros.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what will happen in the future. It's a big percentage that I won't be back at Roland-Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. I enjoy playing here, I like traveling with the family, and my body is feeling a little bit better than it did two months ago,\" he added.\n\nNadal voiced his appreciation for the fans' unwavering support throughout the game, indicating that while his return to Roland Garros is uncertain, his current focus is on continuing to test himself against the world's best players. He expressed his hope to be back on the court for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, stating, \"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me.\"\n\nIn the fiercely contested match, Zverev's powerful serve, forceful forehand, and composure under pressure ultimately proved too much for Nadal. The matchup was highly anticipated, reminiscent of their Paris semifinal two years prior, which ended prematurely due to Zverev's severe ankle injury.\n\nWTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz, and 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic were among the notable attendees, highlighting the match's significance.

Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nIn the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot;

But it ended in disappointment for the Spanish clay-court specialist who is now virtually in the final stages of his career following multiple injury breaks.\n\nAfter just over 45 minutes Zverev broke for a second time in the match to wrap up the first set against Nadal 6-3. The German broke Nadal's service in the first game and set the early tone for the match. Some big serving enabled Zverev to keep his nose in front thereafter as Nadal battled hard to stay in the set but lost a long ninth game to drop serve for a second time.\n\nThe same trend continued, and Zverev took a stranglehold on the match by edging the second set tiebreak 7-5. Rafa had his chances in that set -- he served for it at 5-4 only to be broken to love and he had two break points with the German serving at 5-5. There wasn't much to separate the two players in the shootout either when they swapped ends at 3-3. The fourth seed produced a winning drop volley to go up a mini break at 4-3 and came through a 19-shot exchange to extend that lead to 5-3.\n\nA packed house was treated to a bit of Nadal magic with a rocket of a forehand pass to bring the scores back to 5-4 but a poor drop shot then left Zverev up 6-4 and with two set points. The right-hander converted the second of those to go up two sets to love and leave the left-handed 14-time Roland Garros champion staring at an early exit.\n\nThis was Nadal's first match on Court Philippe-Chatrier since triumphing in 2022. He is 112-3 at Roland Garros and has not lost to someone other than Novak Djokovic at the tournament since 2009 (Robin Soderling).\n\nBut the Spanish star has struggled with injuries over the past couple of years and tallied a 5-3 record this clay-court season entering Roland Garros, well below his lofty standards.\n\nThe German fourth seed Zverev broke Nadal in the seventh game of the third set. Nadal kept things very tight, but Zverev, the three-time Roland Garros semifinalist from Hamburg, rode the momentum to win the set 6-3 and clinch the match.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Just like years previous, the crowd roared ever louder as their hero warmed up, against the backdrop of stadium announcer Marc Maury reading out his incredible list of French Open triumphs.\n\nBut as the match went on against Alexander Zverev, the cheers switched from those of excitement to nervousness, and as it slipped away from him, the crowd tried to will him on.\n\nIf this does prove to be Nadal's final swing at the French Open men's singles title, then he went down fighting against Zverev. Though Nadal has been at pains all week to play down the notion of this fortnight in Paris being a destination on his farewell tour, there was a feeling of finality. His old foe Novak Djokovic was in the crowd. His fans and Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz were there too, not a seat free on this showpiece court at Roland Garros, for a first-round match. They all collectively hoped for one last Nadal hurrah -- just like Serena Williams' fans did at the US Open in 2022.\n\nBut tennis is brutal, and there is little room for sentimentality. For all of Nadal's attempts to claw himself back into the match, the trumpet fanfares, the red and yellow flags in the crowd and moments which were inescapably reminiscent of the Nadal of old, there would be no final flourish at Roland Garros. For this year, at least.\n\nEVER SINCE NADAL made his debut here in 2005, winning the men's singles title the same year, this place has become synonymous with him. His record is frankly ridiculous: winning 14 singles titles, a record of 112 wins in 116 matches, translating to a win percentage of 96.5% -- the highest winning percentage of any singles tennis player in a major. He managed to win the 2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 tournaments without dropping a set. His defeat to Zverev means Nadal has only ever lost to three men here. Zverev now sits alongside Robin Soderling (fourth round, 2009) and Djokovic (2015 quarterfinals, 2021 semifinals) in having defeated Nadal in Paris.\n\nAll of that has transformed him into this legendary figure, yet the beauty of it is, unlike with many masters, you can still witness his craft: He's still there in front of you, unleashing that famous forehand, complete with the familiar pre-serve setup routine.\n\n\"I consider myself lucky that I'm here, that I can still see him, in the locker room or in the players' restaurant, or seeing him practice with the passion he has -- it's amazing,\" Jannik Sinner said Friday. \"He's for sure the biggest inspiration we have in our sport, no?\" For further evidence of the love that surrounds Nadal, take Alize Cornet's reaction to a good luck message he sent to her ahead of her retirement.\n\nBut whether this is the last time we'll see him in the French Open, only he knows. He has been reluctant to surrender any control over his fortunes here -- even to the extent that he reportedly lobbied to have his first-round match in the afternoon, rather than the showpiece evening slot. Those are his preferred conditions -- less humidity, lighter tennis balls.\n\n\"Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever.\"\n\nFor so long, this seemed likely to be his last hurrah. That was the narrative anyway, ever since he announced in May 2023 that he was pulling out of the French Open (subsequently spending the rest of the year sidelined after hip surgery) and in that same news conference saying 2024 would likely be his \"last year\" on tour.\n\n\"I don't think I deserve to end like this,\" he said at the time, sitting in his tennis academy in Manacor, Spain. He wanted to finish his career on the court one final time, sweaty and exhausted.\n\nThat news conference teed up this season as his farewell tour; it was certainly enough for the organizers of the French Open to plan a goodbye ceremony for Nadal this year. But then came the curveball. On Saturday -- in front of a standing-room-only news conference -- he added his own topspin to the debate over his future. He took control of the narrative: no longer was this a long goodbye, but instead, he opened the door to playing on beyond 2024.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on.\" He added he didn't want to \"close 100% the door,\" saying he was enjoying his tennis, loving having his family with him on tour and still figuring out what his body can handle.\n\nHE CAME TO the French Open in patchy form -- 5-3 on clay this year -- as he recovered from an abdominal injury that cut short his hard-court season at the start of the year. He was forced to sit out Monte Carlo, and his withdrawal sparked concerns he wouldn't be fit in time for Roland Garros. \"My body won't let me [return],\" Nadal said at the time. \"It's getting difficult for me. It's been a difficult year and a half, I'm trying every day.\"\n\nBut he did make it back in time for Barcelona, where he lost in the second round to Alex De Minaur. In Madrid, he faced De Minaur again and won in straight sets, but still, he wasn't sure if his body could manage Paris.\n\n\"It's difficult to understand some things, but for me, Roland Garros is the most important tournament of my tennis career, and all the things that I lived there, enjoyed there, stays in my heart forever,\" Nadal said in Madrid. \"So it is not a thing about losing or winning. It's about going on court there with the feeling that I can fight and I can be competitive and, you know, let's go on court and dream about what can happen.\"\n\nHe'd eventually lose in the round of 16 to Jiri Lehecka, while in Rome he was picked apart by Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in straight sets. All the while, people were saying goodbye to him: At the Madrid Open they unfurled a banner saying \"Gracias Rafa,\" recognizing his five wins there.\n\nBut amid all the nostalgia overload and unpredictable form was a resolute Nadal, focused on adding his 23rd Grand Slam title. A source close to Nadal told ESPN that in the lead-up to the French Open he was training, without pain, three hours a time and was building confidence. He came into the tournament unseeded, ranked 272 in the world, but not one player on the men's draw would have wanted to have drawn him. Carlos Alcaraz was asked whether he secretly wanted to draw his hero Nadal in the first round. \"No, honestly,\" he answered, smiling.\n\nThe players are fully aware of the aura around him at Roland Garros. \"You're not playing the statue, you're playing the actual person. But you are playing Rafa Nadal,\" Zverev said before their first-round match. \"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nPlaying Nadal at Roland Garros is as much a mental task as it is skill. \"He has the capability to spin the ball not like other players,\" Daniil Medvedev said. \"Getting these high balls, especially on clay, is not easy. Then we go to where he fights for every point, he brings intensity to every point. You know you're going to be tired, you know it's going to be tough. It's not easy. Rafa will always be Rafa.\"\n\nStefanos Tsitsipas, talking in Monte Carlo in mid-April, summed up what it's like to play Nadal. \"I think he's the ultimate challenge on clay.\"\n\nThat's what it comes back to, that expectation that regardless of what shape he's in or his previous run of form, at Roland Garros, he finds a way to make it work. He came into the 2022 tournament with a 4-2 record on clay that year and ended up winning the whole thing, despite a foot injury.\n\nThe players don't forget moments like that. \"Regardless of the fact that he hasn't played much, he is who he is in Roland Garros,\" Djokovic said.\n\nNADAL WILL FOREVER be a legend at the French Open. It's just a question of whether we'll see him again in this tournament. His old sparring partner certainly hopes so.\n\n\"If he says 'ciao,' he will do it on a court and not on his couch, and I love that because he is very far from being 100%,\" Roger Federer said on the French TV program \"Telematin\" earlier this week. \"I don't know anything, but I would like it to end as he has decided, with his family and his team. I would like him to continue on the circuit a little longer than people believe.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts.\n\n\"But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nUnseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros.\n\nBut Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd.\n\nThe Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not \"close the door\" on a return to the Paris showpiece.\n\nIt seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nNadal added: \"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no? I think if that's the last time that I'm gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it's normal.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.\"\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nZverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world.

The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semifinal.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarterfinalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current U.S. Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThe 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over U.S. wildcard Sachia Vickery.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Japan Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev",

Ra-fa!\" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at Roland-Garros and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\"\n\nWhen the 14-time champion at Roland-Garros approached the net for the pre-match coin toss. When he took his swings during the warm-up. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nWatch Roland-Garros 2024 live and exclusively free on Nine and 9Now. Plus four courts in 4K UHD on Stan Sport, the home of grand slam tennis.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts -- he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 -- and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at Roland-Garros.\n\n\"The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said over the weekend he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose son, Rafael Jr, sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland-Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nTuesday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time grand slam champion unable to play his customary way after one and a half years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No.275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No.6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No.4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semi-finals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Tuesday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realised could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts.\n\nHis numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 198cm Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nNadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.", "source": {"uri": "wwos.nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "wwos.nine.com.au"}, "authors": [],

Despite the defeat, Nadal expressed hopes to return for the 2024 Paris Olympics. The emotional event saw Nadal's usual rituals as he battled through the match, receiving immense support from fans.\n\nRafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday.\n\n\"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. Sixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6 6-4 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer. Medvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from a early break down in the third set where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set. Koepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3 only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType":

Two years later, the result was very different.\n\nNadal fell in straight sets -- 6-4, 7-6(7-5), 6-3 -- in a grueling three-hour match that the 14-time French Open winner said would likely be his final match at Roland Garros. He finishes with a record of 112 wins and four losses.\n\nHe was still Rafa, but muted. A little slower than we remember. A little heavier in the feet. The shots that used to fall so artfully on the line were now a few centimeters wide.\n\nIt wasn't until the fifth game of the first set that Nadal started to really look like himself. He finally began hitting the ball with authority, attacking instead of constantly reacting, and using the entire court to challenge Zverev.\n\nBut it just wasn't enough. We may have reached the point where Nadal's vast experience is a burden and no longer an advantage. He has 10 years on the 27-year-old Zverev, and a long history of foot, hip and abdominal injuries. He's already dealt with hip and abdominal issues this season, which is one of the reasons Nadal looked tentative on Monday.\n\nFlashes of the real Rafa were there. He could still hit the ball into impossible corners and create shots that no human could hope to return. Those moments were infrequent, but they were there.\n\nAnd those moments built a foundation for Nadal to stand on in the second set. Down 2-1, he caught fire, finally unearthing his cross-court backhand and winning five points in a row for the first time in the match. He won the game to even the set at 2-2, jumping with delight while the capacity crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier delivered a deafening response. The audience was even louder when he won his second straight game to break Zverev for the first time.\n\nNadal fought back in a tremendous third set, thrilling the spectators at as he crossed the court to catch Zverev's returns. But Zverev held and the constant pressure finally wore an exhausted Nadal down.\n\nWith an admiring crowd giving an adoring cheer for Nadal, Zverev was gracious in speaking after the match, ceding the moment to his renowned opponent.\n\n\"First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" he said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and was lucky enough to play him when I turned professional. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment. Thank you.\"\n\nNadal then took the microphone to thank the fans, acknowledging that it could be his final visit to Roland Garros, though he hopes to return for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"Bonjour a tous. I'd like to thank you all, it's an incredible opportunity,\" said Nadal, who missed last year's tournament with a hip injury. \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time in front of all of you. Honestly, I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court throughout my career, with all the success I had winning here, I could never have dreamed of it,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kMvXd2XsXFIrDbIIdMVkKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/17ef5b80-1c3d-11ef-85ef-5dd3b794414b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

I hope you understand,\" said the Spaniard.\n\nNadal, who will celebrate his 38th birthday on June 3, faces world number four Alexander Zverev in the first round in Paris on Monday.\n\nThe Spanish legend has racked up 112 wins in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning 2005 debut when he was just 19.\n\nHe has 22 Grand Slam titles -- second only to Novak Djokovic's 24 on the all-time men's list -- but his career has been plagued by injuries.

Advertisement\n\n\"I have been going through a long process of recovery with a very difficult injury, almost two years of suffering, but I feel better now,\" he added.\n\n\"I have fewer limitations than three, four weeks ago, without a doubt.\"\n\nNadal had to sit out the 2023 French Open through injury.\n\nThe year before he won his 14th title but revealed that he could only play with daily pain-killing injections in his feet. Advertisement\n\n- 'Positive legacy' -\"In some ways I don't want to close the door 100%. I am enjoying playing tennis. I am travelling with the family. They are enjoying,\" added Nadal on his reluctance to call time on his career.\n\n\"So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, okay, it's enough, I can't keep going, but today in some way I cannot guarantee that that's going to be the last one. But of course it's a big chance.\"\n\nNadal arrives in Paris having yet to make a clay-court quarter-final this season. In Rome, he was defeated in the second round.\n\n\"I feel competitive in training. Maybe not in an official match, but when I enter the court, I feel like I can beat anyone,\" he said. Advertisement\n\nNadal holds a 7-3 winning record over Zverev.\n\nFive of those victories came on clay including a semi-final triumph at Roland Garros in 2022 when the German was forced to quit with ankle ligament damage.\n\nIn Paris so far this week, Nadal has practised in front of packed courts.\n\nHe hit with fellow former champion Stan Wawrinka who described Nadal as \"strong as ever\". Advertisement\n\nFifth-ranked Daniil Medvedev, who trained with him on Thursday, said he was happy not to face him in the first round.\n\n\"This place is magical for me. If in the bottom of my heart, I didn't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I would not be here in front of you guys,\" added Nadal.\n\n\"So I still have the motivation and a small, at least is a small hope to play well.\"\n\nAnd if 2024 turns out to be Nadal's French Open farewell? Advertisement\n\n\"I just can say thanks to all the love I received from all the players, from the organisers, from the tournaments, from all the community of tennis and sport.\n\n\"I feel very proud that probably I leave a positive legacy there.\"\n\nFrench veteran Gael Monfils, who is also 37 and first played Nadal in 2005, said: \"we should enjoy it as much as we can\".\n\n\"I wonder if we're not going back to traditional tournaments as they were played a long time ago, because the last 20 years are not run-of-the-mill normal years,\" added Monfils of two decades dominated by Nadal, Novak Djokovic and the now-retired Roger Federer.

The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\n\"I don't know what to say... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it's such a great honour,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.\"\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier.\n\nFaced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nWatched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.\n\nThe boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.\n\nMeanwhile, three-times French Open champion Iga Swiatek began her title defence by crushing qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-1 6-2.\n\nThe 22-year-old world number one arrived in Paris on the back of a 12-match winning streak on clay, having rolled through the tournaments in Madrid and Rome.\n\n\"Matches like that give me a lot of satisfaction,\" said Swiatek, who next faces former world number one Naomi Osaka in the second round. \"Overall, I am happy with my performance.\"\n\nUS Open champion Coco Gauff kicked off her campaign by overwhelming Russian qualifier Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1.

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics. \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\nThat left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday. The 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Mar\u00adton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1. The 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com",

In a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent. Chants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.

Pic/AFP\n\nRafael Nadal's record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 3-6, 6-7 (5-7), 3-6 to World No. 4 Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut.\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport. \"I don't know if this is the last time I'll be here, I'm not 100% sure. but if it is then I wanted to enjoy it. The feelings today are difficult to describe in words,\" said Nadal. Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. He saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he hit a loose forehand into the net.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso Read: India's Yuki Bhambri attains career-best ATP doubles ranking of 52\n\nNadal then broke for the first time to lead 3-2 in the second set, but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5-3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep, broke and held for 2-0 in the third set. However, the hardworking Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before going on to win.\n\nIga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 win over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. World No. 1 Swiatek said: \"It feels like home here. I'm really happy to be back.

I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts.\n\n\"But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\nAlexander Zverev, right, beat Rafael Nadal in straight sets (Jean-Francois Badias/AP)\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nUnseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros.\n\nBut Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd.\n\nThe Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not \"close the door\" on a return to the Paris showpiece.\n\nIt seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nNadal added: \"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no? I think if that's the last time that I'm gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it's normal.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.\"\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nZverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world.

I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha.\n\n\"For me it's tough to say what's going on in the future. There's a big percentage I won't be back here, but I can't say 100 per cent. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it's enough, I can't give anything else, but it's something I don't feel yet.\n\n\"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that's motivation. The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable - I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it's been a beautiful process.\n\n\"Every year has been different and what it makes it seem so special are the people behind the scenes who have helped me. It's been unforgettable. The feelings you have made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nIf there was a sour note to this absorbing match, it was that the French Open's greatest hero should have fallen to one of the most divisive figures in the sport. In Berlin in Friday, a court will consider Zverev's defence against claims of domestic abuse levelled by his former girlfriend Brenda Patea, although Zverev has not been required to attend.\n\nAs Zverev gave a respectful verbal tribute to Nadal at the finish of the match, a voice from the stands could be heard shouting \"The trial, the trial!\"\n\nNadal was highly competitive, despite going down in straight sets. His 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 defeat occupied fully three hours and five minutes, and one suspects he would have pushed Zverev even closer but for the showery weather that forced the closure of the Court Philippe Chatrier roof.\n\nIn the still air, Zverev's blunderbuss of a serve - which is arguably the best shot in the world right now - was able to shape the direction of the match. He landed 77 per cent of his first serves, earning a series of cheap points, while Nadal had to sweat and toil for every inch of territory.\n\nFor a man who turns 38 next week, the effort was simply too great. But Nadal still showed plenty of the strokes that made him the King of Clay: the booming forehand, the delicate drop shots, and the decisive touches of the net, all complemented by the trademark \"start the lawnmower\" celebrations.\n\nThe end result was his fourth defeat in 18 French Opens. Assuming that Nadal doesn't return next year, he will finish with a 112-4 record that must stand among the most extraordinary achievements in the whole of sport.\n\nAt the same time, though, the quality of his play would suggest that he has more left to give. Another interesting detail from his pre-tournament press conference was his admission that last week was the first \"since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations\".\n\nHad he come up with a more favourable draw, he could have potentially played himself into form and even gone deep into the tournament.\n\nfrom one of the sport's all-time greats. No definitive retirement announcement so we will have to wait and see, but Rafael Nadal won't be adding the 2024 French Open to his astonishing roll of honour here. Alex Zverev might well do, though: he looks in fine form and he came through the mental test of this impressively. He's available at about 9/2 in an open betting field: Alcaraz the fav at 2/1, Sinner 3/1, Novak fours. Please join us throughout the tournament for further live blogs. Cheers.\n\nZverev landed a highly impressive 78% of his first serve, the bedrock of his victory and comparing favourably with Nadal's 69%. Of that 78%, he won 71% of them and that smells like victory to me. Nadal's second serve: he only won 50% of points on that, probably going some way to explaining why AZ got 18 break point opportunities. Converted six of them, failed on 12, which you could attribute to Nadal's x-factor/will/legend. But in all honesty, Zverev looked the most likely winner from game one.\n\nThe moment was at 5-4 to Nadal in the second with Nadal serving for the set but Zverev found another level and broke him to love.\n\n\"It is incredible, I want to say thank you. It is difficult for me to talk. I am not 100% sure if this is going to be the last time I am in front of you. The feelings I have today are hard to describe. To feel the love in the place I love the most. I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match. I know 2022 (???) has been a super tough moment for you and so I wish you the best.\"\n\n\"I have been going through a tough moment, so many injuries but I went through it to get back here. I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. There is a big chance I won't be back but I can't say 100%. My body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it is enough but I don't feel it yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. I have amazing feelings on this court, I never dreamed as a kid I would be here at 28. Sorry, 38. I would love to be 28! All the memories have been different, so special. Support has been unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nBut I think it is fair to say that the focus is on his opponent.\n\nZverev post match interview: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour. I have watched him all my childhood I have been lucky enough to play him, and twice on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment it is Rafa's moment and I am not going to speak much.\"\n\nNadal, who has won 91 points to his opponents 109, serves at 0-30 in what might likely be his last ever game on the court he has made his own. Some brilliant and dogged defence from Nadal but Zverev is all over him and eventually crunches a crosscourt winner past him.\n\nNadal, the 14 time champion, serves at 15-40. He puts a groundstroke long and that is game, set and match Zverev as one of the great sporting dynasties ends, or possibly ends. Hard to think of a player in any sport who has so dominated a venue.\n\nAZ shores up the break and it's do or die now for Rafa Nadal.\n\nIs that the fatal blow? You never write off Nadal, but this break from Zverev may prove a bridge too far. A double fault doesn't help the cause.\n\nZverev with the hold for 3-3.\n\nIt's a third deuce. Both men seem to sense that this game might be the end of it if Zverev can break. He's the one turning the screw, it feels like the great Spaniard is clinging on. Facing break point, Rafa produces an ace and the crowd roar.\n\n11 minutes in, and Rafa finally holds it. What a battler.\n\nNobody else is gonna do it for ya. Both well worth a read. Back to the match then, where Rafa is serving at 2-2 in what feels like a crucial game...\n\nAnother famous face behind the court: Iga Swiatek, although I think she might have nipped out again now. I'm sure someone wrote a piece about how Nadal is the most respected and admired figure in the modern game, at least among his peers.\n\nOh and possibly another piece on why Swiatek is the player most likely to continue his legacy.\n\nWell, you've got to bang your own drum every now and then, haven't you?\n\nZverev, serving at 40-40, fighting hard. An error from Rafa, hitting a groundstroke into the net. Now Rafa Nadal returns long, Zverev holds and it is 2-2.\n\nAh shame. He's broken right back by Zverev who, to be fair to him, is playing an extremely professional match in difficult circs.\n\nBig chances for Rafa as he races into a 0-40 lead here. But fair play to Zverev for two beefy serves - but Rafa will not be denied and he has scored an early break.\n\nMagnificent from Nadal at 15-40. The accuracy, the variety, the intelligence. A long rally but sealed with an artist's touch. Wins the next one as well and it's deuce. Holds serve with real heart.\n\nIt was 7-5 in the end. Close, but Zverev always had his nose just in front.\n\nZverev, serving first, wins the point after a long, punishing and high quality rally that ends with Nadal floating a slice out. 1-0\n\nNadal to the net, and the Spanish man seals a dominant point. 1-1\n\nNadal, maybe over-aggressive, puts a forehand wide from the centre of the baseline. 2-1\n\nBut Zverev, on top in the next point, tightens and fires wide when he should have done better. 2-2\n\nZverev wins the next point, always on top in that one. Needs a second smash to finalise it. 3-2\n\nNadal takes the next point and gives himself a rub down with a towel. 3-3\n\nNadal serve. Real quality from Zverev here after Nadal somehow runs down an overhead, but AZ shows excellent composure to seal the point with a low volley. 4-3 with a mini-break.\n\nBut A punishing serve from Zverev is unreturnable, and that is the second set 7-5 on the breaker.\n\nNadal holds with real authority to set up a tie break.\n\nSimon Briggs: \"Zverev overcame his own wobbles impressively there, living off that massive and relentless serve. Even if Rafa can still take this set on a tie-break, it's so much work for a guy not well conditioned to matchplay right now. Shout out for the brass band and their 'Eye of the Tiger'.\"\n\nServing at 15-30, Zverev picks an inopportune moment for a double fault. But an ace helps him back to 40-40 and he wins he game to compel Nadal to serve.\n\nBrutal. Zverev breaks the Nadal serve to love and the crowd are rocked.\n\nZverev holds his serve and Nadal will now serve to win the set. Think most people were predicting Zverev to put the great man away in straight sets and if this does get to 1-1, with the vibe Nadal is generating on court, well I'd say all bets are off.....\n\nNadal serving. 15-30. Zverev with a wonderful hit on the run, surely thinks he has passed his man but Nadal produces a lovely pick up low shot to win the point. Gossamer touch at the net now from Rafa, his short game has been flawless today, winning nine points out of nine at the net. At 40-30, Zverev has the court and point at his command but flaps the ball into the net.\n\nThat is the hold Zverev needed. Commanding, energy surpressing.\n\nRafa is starting to happen, he's trying things that are working, the crowd are cheering his every move. Battle now for AZ is not so much the technical but the emotional side of the contest. Nadal holds.\n\nZverev needs a few steely serves, quieten the energy.\n\nHint of a sniff of a chance as Zverev serves at 30-30. RN takes the initiative, he knows that he has to swing for the fences here, Zverev on the back foot and he makes an error into the net. 30-40. Nadal gets the serve back and it creeps in.... Zverev unsettled, loses his timing, a poor shot, and Nadal wins the point with a drop shot! Nadal with a break of serve!\n\nThat's what I was saying about Rafa getting into Zverev's head. The huge celebration after saving break points brought the crowd to life. And then the Zverev forehand - always his shakier side - began to show a few cracks, leading to Nadal's first break of serve. Fans having a ball now. Although I should say they have been pretty sporting. Big applause for a Zverev forehand winner in the last game. I've been at Djokovic-Federer matches in New York where Djokovic hits a winner and there's tumbleweed\n\nNadal serve under real pressure here but he just about holds on. Crowd roaring him on now as he produces an ace at 30-40. Gets out of jail.\n\nA brace of aces in this Zverev hold.\n\nSome sporting royalty spotted in the crowd. Not just Manchester City's Rodri but two of the favourites for this title: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. They clearly think it might be Nadal's French Open finale, even if he isn't sure.\n\nNadal with a determined hold in the second game, however. His cause helped by Zverev bungling a regulation overhead shot. Excellent point from Nadal at 40-0! Dogged defence into insisting ground strokes, then he picks a drop shot early, gets there, and puts it away for a winner. Fist pump and a roar!\n\nZverev will be looking to go up a gear here and break the back of the match early in the second set. A dominant service hold sends him onwards.\n\nIn his pre-tournament press conference, Nadal said \"If, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.\"\n\nI'm not sure this match has been \"beautiful\" thus far but it's warmed up into a decent spectacle. And, crucially, not one that embarrasses Nadal (although he has just walked off court for an early bathroom break). Certainly better than his most recent outing in Rome, a 6-1, 6-3 humbling at the hands of Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nThe critical stat so far is surely Zverev's 78 per cent first serves in.\n\nIt's deuce. Reaching for a crosscourt, Nadal finds the net. It's set point to the German. RN takes charge of the rally with hard, flat, aggressive groundstrokes and forces an error. A second deuce. But eventually Zverev wins the game and Zverev wins the first set.\n\nZverev wins first set 6-3, breaking Nadal in the first game and the ninth game of the opener. Nadal only got 58% of his first serves in.\n\nAnother hold from Zverev takes him to within a game of the first set.\n\nNadal holds. He looks like he is enjoying himself. He's moving Zverev around the court a bit more and he's getting into it. No doubt as to where the crowd's affections lie, and correctly so: Nadal, a legend, a gent. Zverev, well the less said the better.\n\nZverev's turn to hold his serve to love. Here's more from Briggsy:\n\n\"Zverev really settling to his work now, and hitting at an average of 83mph off both wings. Nadal way behind on 72 for his forehand and 74 for his backhand. That's a little misleading in a way, because his forehand has a spin-laden heaviness to it which makes the ball harder to deal with, even if it's not as quick through the air. But still a decisive difference.\"\n\nAfter a nervy three, three-and-a-half games, some signs that the players are settling in. Quite the occasion this. Up in the press box, there was an unseemly scramble for seats.\n\nNadal, hearteningly, holds his serve to love. It's raining in Paris by the way, although obviously we are under the roof on this court.\n\nZverev holds his serve.\n\nVital hold for Nadal, who is on the board. And perhaps encouraged by the fact that Zverev has made a couple of backhand errors in this game.\n\nBit of a delay because a couple of punters in the posh seats are moving around and causing distraction.\n\nThat's age for ya. Little drop shot from Zverev, not perfect and it sits up a bit. In his prime, Rafa would have hared over there, slid, and hit a winner. But today, he just gives it up when six or eight yards away, knowing that it would be a waste of energy.\n\nNadal wins the first two points of that game. When he can stand and deliver he still looks mighty but the court coverage is going to be the issue. If Sascha can play the man not the legend here, he should win with plenty in hand.\n\nNadal is up against is straight away. Zverev aggressive, direct, moving the Spanish veteran around and he's been very dominant there. Before you know it, it's 0-40 and, not that the great man needed telling, but he knows he's in a huge fight. Zverev takes the first of the three break points at his disposal.\n\nshirt with white shorts, his opponent in a shirt with a yellow front and white back. It's Nadal to serve first.\n\nA few boos ring out among the cheers as Alexander Zverev enters the stadium. The closed roof clearly favours Zverev, both because Nadal is the world's best windy-weather player (his heavy spin cuts through the breeze) and because Zverev has arguably the best serve in the game right now, which will only be enhanced by the lack of any wind to disrupt his ball-toss. He is landing a mind-boggling 74 per cent of his first serves this season, and unless Nadal gets in his head, I'd expect that figure to climb above 80 today.\n\nTo a rapturous reception, as you might imagine, and this could be a fantastic occasion. By the way, it's Alan Tyers here to talk you through the action.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage from the French Open in what could be Rafael Nadal's final match at Roland Garros.\n\nThe 14-time champion begins his campaign against Alexander Zverev, which is the standout match in the first round.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories.\n\nZverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nAny plans to pay tribute to Nadal if he loses have been scuppered because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nAs soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nIn the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing

Reuters\n\nThough he did not confirm his decision to retire at the end of what has turned out to be a disappointing 2024 season so far, Rafael Nadal potentially bowed out of the French Open one last time with a first-round defeat against world No 4 Alexander Zverev.\n\nNadal had won the clay-court Grand Slam a total of 14 times and had suffered only three defeats heading into Monday's opening-round fixture against Zverev. The Spaniard, however, could hardly keep up with his German opponent on Monday, suffering a 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 defeat that resulted in a first-ever opening-round exit at Roland Garros.\n\nCourt Philippe-Chatrier was packed to the rafters to witness Nadal commence what was widely believed to be his final campaign at his favourite hunting ground, and the crowd was heavily cheering him on against Zverev, hoping their support would carry him into the second round even if the veteran, who turns 38 on 3 June, was nowhere close to his best and also appeared to be struggling with his fitness.\n\nDespite the disappointing defeat however, Nadal gave his fans present at the venue as well as those watching around the world a ray of hope that this perhaps wasn't his final appearance at the clay-court Grand Slam after all.\n\n\"It is difficult for me to talk, I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you,\" Nadal said during the post-match interview after his defeat against Zverev.\n\n\"Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough.

Across two decades, he had orchestrated one of the greatest eras of dominance in sporting history, pushing the art of clay court tennis to unimaginable heights. For so long, his success in Paris seemed so inevitable.\n\nNow it may be over. As Nadal returned this year unseeded, days away from his 38th birthday and desperately searching for form of old, his brutal first round draw against Alexander Zverev pitted his muscle memory of greatness against a top contender with ideal form and preparation.\n\nIn one of the most highly anticipated men's first-round matches in the sport's history, there were no miracles to be found under Court Philippe-Chatrier's roof as Zverev withstood a tense, rousing second-set fightback from Nadal before winning 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3.\n\nNadal's defeat marks the first time that he has lost in the first two rounds at Roland Garros. He had only just returned to the tour last month after being largely absent for 15 months after hip surgery in 2023, yet Nadal now must reckon with the possibility that this may be his last showing at the tournament that has defined his career.\n\n\"It's incredible, the amount of energy, It's difficult for me to talk,\" Nadal said. \" I don't know if it's gonna be the last time if I'm going to be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I'm not 100% sure, but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words but for me it's so special to feel the love from the people, in the way that I felt in the place that I won the most.\"\n\nThe significance of this moment was reflected in the other top players present, as Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz took in the occasion from the overflowing stands. As Nadal entered Court Philippe-Chatrier, he was predictably serenaded with an immense outpouring of appreciation from 15,000 people. As usual, every single one of his 14 titles was counted down by Marc Maury, the French Open announcer, during his warm-up.\n\nBut a grim opening service game from the Spaniard offered an immediate reminder of his current limitations. After dropping his opening service game to love, Nadal spent the rest of the set chasing shadows as Zverev fired down serves while averaging 78% first serves in, dominating the baseline exchanges and attacking his forehand.\n\nJust as the match seemed to be moving away from Nadal at 1-2, 15-40 on his serve, Nadal came alive. After recovering to hold serve, he used his momentum brilliantly, forcing himself inside the baseline, unleashing his down-the-line forehand and eventually establishing a 5-3 lead. But Zverev played a spectacular return game to retrieve the break, and in the tie-break, under significant pressure, the player with ample matches under his belt logically won the most important points.\n\nAs Zverev closed out the encounter in three tough sets, Nadal made the German's life difficult throughout, offering many glimpses of the quality that has garnered him so much success. He fought until the bitter end. But with so little preparation behind him, it was simply not enough against a top player.\n\nAlthough he received no ceremony at his request, Nadal remained on-court to address his audience at the most important tournament of his career. Again, he said his future is uncertain: \"For me, it's difficult to say what's happening in the future,\" he said.\n\n\"Probably it's a big percentage that I'll not be back playing here in Roland Garros but I can't say 100%. I enjoyed a lot being here, I am travelling with the family and I am having fun. The body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say: 'It's enough, I can't give anything else.' But it's something I don't feel yet. I have some goals in mind. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, it's something that motivates me. That will be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared. The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during all of my tennis career is just unbelievable.\"\n\nOnly time will tell if this is Nadal's last appearance at Roland Garros. But after training and competing for a month without any major physical issues and being competitive against one of the best players in the world with minimal preparation, it is clear that he would love to continue competing and to explore his limits late in his career. It remains to be seen if his body will allow him to do so.\n\nFor Zverev, the second round awaits. On Friday, during third-round action in Paris, his public trial begins in Berlin for allegedly physically abusing his ex-partner, Brenda Patea.

So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it.

Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?Players who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?Players tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?Mauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 292, "textEnd": 298}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1793, "textEnd": 1799}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

fighting.\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavorable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.\n\nFaced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nWatched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.\n\nThe boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri":

Or perhaps he is. Rafael Nadal was all coy about future visits to the French Open after losing in the first round for the first time.\n\nRafael Nadal - he who has won the tournament 14 times and has the shoes to prove it - gave the distinct impression last year that this year would be his final traipse around the ATP circuit. But now, maybe not. \"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal said after his first round loss to Alexander Zverev. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because my wife and child are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see. I need to give myself a little bit longer to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\" Exactly who do you think you are? One of the greatest players of all time?\n\nDefinitely gone\n\nRafael Nadal lost in the first round for the first time since he started coming to the French Open in 2005. Even he said it's unusual for him not to be the favourite to win his first round match. But that's what happens when you slip down to number 276 in the world and you face the fourth seed at a tournament soon after he has claimed the Italian Open. Nadal was valiant in defeat and munificent. \"Well played,\" he told Zverev during the on-court interviews. \"Congratulations on your win in Rome and all the best for the rest of this tournament.\"\n\nDuty calls\n\nAlexander Zverev did his duty. As fourth seed you are supposed to beat the world number 276. And give or take a flew butterflies, he fulfilled the brief. \"I think that generally the whole tennis world since the draw came out was only talking about that one match,\" Zverev reflected an hour or so after his straight sets victory over Nadal. \"So it is definitely very, very different. But I know that I have to keep focusing. I know that I will play great players ahead still, and I have to focus on that.\"\n\nCan I see him?\n\nIt was no surprise to spot Iga Swiatek in the crowd during the match between Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev. The women's world number one is a rolling-eyes of a Nadal fan girl. Nadal's fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz was also watching so too a certain Novak Djokovic, who had until Alexander Zverev's victory, been one of the only two men to have beaten Nadal at the French Open. Nadal said he was flattered. \"These young players that are here like Carlos ... they probably have been watching me on TV most of their lives,\" said Nadal. \"It's normal that in some way they are interested to see how this going to be, and especially in this particular place with all the history that I had. I am happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career, no?\" A definite yes Rafa.\n\nEmotions\n\nSince there's no need to be overwhelmed overly early in the tournament, organisers generously placed the showman incarnate Gael Monfils in the second night session. The local hero - who is a few months younger than Rafael Nadal - was up against Thiago Seyboth Wild from Brazil. Monfils was his usual flamboyant self and took the first set in 29 minutes 6-2 to the utter delight of the partisans. Monfils being Monfils went for a mental walk as he ran around in the second set. He steadied the ship and won the next two sets to move into the second round. Imagine that, Monfils doing better than Nadal at the French Open.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_myers@rfi.fr", "name": "Paul Myers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiago_Seyboth_Wild", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiago Seyboth Wild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ga\u00ebl_Monfils", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ga\u00ebl Monfils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/7664315c-1c6c-11ef-9244-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/shoes-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

I was competitive but Sascha (Zverev) has been brilliant. There is a big percentage that I will not be back but I cannot be 100 per cent sure. I'm travelling well. The body is feeling better.

However, he was beaten in the second round in Barcelona by Alex de Minaur.\n\nThe Spaniard took revenge on the Australian in Madrid before being knocked out by Jiri Lehecka in the last 16. He was then beaten comfortably by Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of the Rome Open.\n\nHis French Open exit was the first time he had been knocked out in the opening round of the Grand Slam.

Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\nDaniil Medvedev had lost in the first round on five of his previous seven Roland Garros appearances, but made no mistake this time, seeing off Dominik Koepfer in four sets.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nBut sixth-seeded Greek Maria Sakkari bowed out in the first round for the second straight year with a three-set loss to Varvara Gracheva.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka

So what can I do? That's the draw. Just try to be ready for it.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 in a week's time, has shown flashes of his best form in the clay-court swing, but was thrashed 6-1, 6-3 by Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of his last outing in Rome.\n\nHe boasts a 7-3 winning record over Zverev ahead of their first meeting since the 2022 French Open semi-finals, when the German left the court in a wheelchair near the end of the second set after injuring his ankle.\n\n\"I am not anxious. No, I am focused on trying to play well. That's it,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that.\n\n\"But in my mind, is do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitive.\"\n\nMore from this section Warm, humid conditions this afternoon; cloudy early Friday before becoming sunny Long Island beaches open for the summer In Real Life: Outperforming AI - 'Didn't want' to play Nadal -\n\nZverev did not play again in 2022 after that ankle injury but has climbed the rankings again in recent months.\n\nThe 27-year-old has long been touted as a future Grand Slam champion but remains without one of tennis' four biggest titles.\n\nClay is his strongest surface, though, and he has reached the semi-finals in each of the last three years at Roland Garros.\n\nThe men's draw looks far more open than usual, with doubts surrounding Nadal's fitness and Novak Djokovic having endured a turbulent start to the year.\n\n\"I can guarantee you Novak didn't want to play Rafa in the first round and (Carlos) Alcaraz didn't want to play, Jannik (Sinner) didn't want to play him,\" admitted Zverev.\n\n\"I don't want to play him in the first round, but it is how it is. He has been out injured. He hasn't played a lot of tennis. His ranking is where it is. Of course it's not ideal, but at the same time, you know, there is nothing you can do.\n\n\"Everybody now is excited for a tough battle and tough first round. I think he's excited and I'm excited for it.\"\n\nFrench Open organisers were prepared to stage a tribute ceremony to Nadal to honour his career but the Spaniard was reluctant to endorse such a celebration.\n\n\"We were ready to press the button on it,\" admitted tournament director Amelie Mauresmo.\n\n\"But it's Rafa who manages his timing, we follow what he wants. We wouldn't want to put him in an uncomfortable position.\"\n\njc/dj", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/reformer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/84/784b7aad-aa7a-5314-8847-e279eb1b93ad/66533615bc245.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\nThat left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev's fast start\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nSwiatek makes strong start\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThe 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.",

The German will have another chance to play Nadal at Roland Garros on Monday, as the two stars meet in the first round of the 2024 French Open. Zverev is one of the favorites to win the tournament, while Nadal is a 14-time champion who could be playing in the event for the final time. The Spaniard has won five of the six head-to-head meetings on clay, but Zverev is coming off an Italian Open title.\n\nMonday's Zverev vs. Nadal match is set to start at 9 a.m. ET. The latest 2024 French Open odds list Zverev as a -380 favorite (risk $380 to win $100), with Nadal priced as a +300 underdog (risk $100 to win $300). Other Nadal vs. Zverev bets include an over/under on total games played at 36.5 and Zverev -5.5 games (-128) on the handicap, plus many more. Before you make any Nadal vs. Zverev picks or 2024 French Open predictions, you need to see what tennis expert Blake Von Hagen has to say.\n\nVon Hagen has followed tennis closely for years, keeping an eye on young players before they turn into stars. His dedication to the sport allows him to find value on the Challenger Tour and the ATP Tour alike.\n\nVon Hagen routinely attends ATP events, including at the Challenger level. He keeps up with injuries, recent form, and line movement to identify the best bets of the day. His research allowed him to nail Carlos Alcaraz as a 22-1 longshot to win the 2022 US Open, jumping on board before the market adjusted. He went 20-9 (+11.4u) in the 2024 Rome Masters 1000 earlier this month, nailing three first-round upsets and returning more than $1,100 for $100 bettors in that tournament.\n\nFor Monday, Von Hagen has scrutinized the latest French Open 2024 odds and released his coveted best bets for the Nadal vs. Zverev match. He's sharing his picks and expert analysis only at SportsLine. See what they are at SportsLine.\n\nWhy you should back Nadal\n\nWhile Nadal has played sparingly over the last two years due to various injuries, he is still the best clay-court tennis player of all-time. He has won 14 French Open titles and could be playing in the tournament for the last time in his career, so the fan support will be almost entirely on his side. Nadal has only lost to Zverev once on this surface, and he has never lost a match in the first round at Roland Garros.\n\nHis performances so far this season have not been up to his standards, but he still has a winning record on clay at 5-3. Zverev has never won a Grand Slam and has struggled in some of the biggest matches of his career, which does not bode well heading into an emotional venue like this one. Nadal's mentality has carried him to many titles, so that is a stark contrast between these players. See who to back at SportsLine.\n\nWhy you should back Zverev\n\nNadal's numbers at this event are stunning, but he is no longer in top form at this stage of his career. He failed to make the quarterfinals in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome, winning just four total games in his 2-0 loss to Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian Open. Meanwhile, Zverev has been one of the best clay-court players for years, and he is coming off an impressive title in Rome.\n\nZverev won five of his six matches in that event in straight sets, including a dominant serving performance against Nicolas Jarry in the final. He won a whopping 37 of 39 points behind his first serve and only dropped five total points across 11 service games. The big-serving German can take matters into his own hands on Monday, which will keep Nadal from establishing a rhythm. See who to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 French Open picks\n\nVon Hagen has locked in his best bets for the Nadal vs. Zverev match. He is leaning Over 36.5 total games (-110), but he has two even stronger picks, one on the game handicap and another on a prop bet. You need to see his pick and analysis before considering any 2024 French Open bets.\n\nSo who wins Zverev vs. Nadal, and what are the picks that could lead to big returns?

And why is he unseeded?", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn't the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha.\n\n\"For me it's tough to say what's going on in the future. There's a big percentage I won't be back here, but I can't say 100 per cent. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it's enough, I can't give anything else, but it's something I don't feel yet.\n\n\"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that's motivation. The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable - I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it's been a beautiful process.\n\n\"Every year has been different and what it makes it seem so special are the people behind the scenes who have helped me. It's been unforgettable. The feelings you have made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nfrom one of the sport's all-time greats. No definitive retirement announcement so we will have to wait and see, but Rafael Nadal won't be adding the 2024 French Open to his astonishing roll of honour here. Alex Zverev might well do, though: he looks in fine form and he came through the mental test of this impressively. He's available at about 9/2 in an open betting field: Alcaraz the fav at 2/1, Sinner 3/1, Novak fours. Please join us throughout the tournament for further live blogs. Cheers.\n\nZverev landed a highly impressive 78% of his first serve, the bedrock of his victory and comparing favourably with Nadal's 69%. Of that 78%, he won 71% of them and that smells like victory to me. Nadal's second serve: he only won 50% of points on that, probably going some way to explaining why AZ got 18 break point opportunities. Converted six of them, failed on 12, which you could attribute to Nadal's x-factor/will/legend. But in all honesty, Zverev looked the most likely winner from game one.\n\nThe moment was at 5-4 to Nadal in the second with Nadal serving for the set but Zverev found another level and broke him to love.\n\n\"It is incredible, I want to say thank you. It is difficult for me to talk. I am not 100% sure if this is going to be the last time I am in front of you. The feelings I have today are hard to describe. To feel the love in the place I love the most. I have to congratulate Sascha for this great match. I know 2022 (???) has been a super tough moment for you and so I wish you the best.\"\n\n\"I have been going through a tough moment, so many injuries but I went through it to get back here. I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player. There is a big chance I won't be back but I can't say 100%. My body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it is enough but I don't feel it yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. I have amazing feelings on this court, I never dreamed as a kid I would be here at 28. Sorry, 38. I would love to be 28! All the memories have been different, so special. Support has been unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\nBut I think it is fair to say that the focus is on his opponent.\n\nZverev post match interview: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour. I have watched him all my childhood I have been lucky enough to play him, and twice on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment it is Rafa's moment and I am not going to speak much.\"\n\nNadal, who has won 91 points to his opponents 109, serves at 0-30 in what might likely be his last ever game on the court he has made his own. Some brilliant and dogged defence from Nadal but Zverev is all over him and eventually crunches a crosscourt winner past him.\n\nNadal, the 14 time champion, serves at 15-40. He puts a groundstroke long and that is game, set and match Zverev as one of the great sporting dynasties ends, or possibly ends. Hard to think of a player in any sport who has so dominated a venue.\n\nAZ shores up the break and it's do or die now for Rafa Nadal.\n\nIs that the fatal blow? You never write off Nadal, but this break from Zverev may prove a bridge too far. A double fault doesn't help the cause.\n\nZverev with the hold for 3-3.\n\nIt's a third deuce. Both men seem to sense that this game might be the end of it if Zverev can break. He's the one turning the screw, it feels like the great Spaniard is clinging on. Facing break point, Rafa produces an ace and the crowd roar.\n\n11 minutes in, and Rafa finally holds it. What a battler.\n\nNobody else is gonna do it for ya. Both well worth a read. Back to the match then, where Rafa is serving at 2-2 in what feels like a crucial game...\n\nAnother famous face behind the court: Iga Swiatek, although I think she might have nipped out again now. I'm sure someone wrote a piece about how Nadal is the most respected and admired figure in the modern game, at least among his peers.\n\nOh and possibly another piece on why Swiatek is the player most likely to continue his legacy.\n\nWell, you've got to bang your own drum every now and then, haven't you?\n\nZverev, serving at 40-40, fighting hard. An error from Rafa, hitting a groundstroke into the net. Now Rafa Nadal returns long, Zverev holds and it is 2-2.\n\nAh shame. He's broken right back by Zverev who, to be fair to him, is playing an extremely professional match in difficult circs.\n\nBig chances for Rafa as he races into a 0-40 lead here. But fair play to Zverev for two beefy serves - but Rafa will not be denied and he has scored an early break.\n\nMagnificent from Nadal at 15-40. The accuracy, the variety, the intelligence. A long rally but sealed with an artist's touch. Wins the next one as well and it's deuce. Holds serve with real heart.\n\nIt was 7-5 in the end. Close, but Zverev always had his nose just in front.\n\nZverev, serving first, wins the point after a long, punishing and high quality rally that ends with Nadal floating a slice out. 1-0\n\nNadal to the net, and the Spanish man seals a dominant point. 1-1\n\nNadal, maybe over-aggressive, puts a forehand wide from the centre of the baseline. 2-1\n\nBut Zverev, on top in the next point, tightens and fires wide when he should have done better. 2-2\n\nZverev wins the next point, always on top in that one. Needs a second smash to finalise it. 3-2\n\nNadal takes the next point and gives himself a rub down with a towel. 3-3\n\nNadal serve. Real quality from Zverev here after Nadal somehow runs down an overhead, but AZ shows excellent composure to seal the point with a low volley. 4-3 with a mini-break.\n\nBut A punishing serve from Zverev is unreturnable, and that is the second set 7-5 on the breaker.\n\nNadal holds with real authority to set up a tie break.\n\nSimon Briggs: \"Zverev overcame his own wobbles impressively there, living off that massive and relentless serve. Even if Rafa can still take this set on a tie-break, it's so much work for a guy not well conditioned to matchplay right now. Shout out for the brass band and their 'Eye of the Tiger'.\"\n\nServing at 15-30, Zverev picks an inopportune moment for a double fault. But an ace helps him back to 40-40 and he wins he game to compel Nadal to serve.\n\nBrutal. Zverev breaks the Nadal serve to love and the crowd are rocked.\n\nZverev holds his serve and Nadal will now serve to win the set. Think most people were predicting Zverev to put the great man away in straight sets and if this does get to 1-1, with the vibe Nadal is generating on court, well I'd say all bets are off.....\n\nNadal serving. 15-30. Zverev with a wonderful hit on the run, surely thinks he has passed his man but Nadal produces a lovely pick up low shot to win the point. Gossamer touch at the net now from Rafa, his short game has been flawless today, winning nine points out of nine at the net. At 40-30, Zverev has the court and point at his command but flaps the ball into the net.\n\nThat is the hold Zverev needed. Commanding, energy surpressing.\n\nRafa is starting to happen, he's trying things that are working, the crowd are cheering his every move. Battle now for AZ is not so much the technical but the emotional side of the contest. Nadal holds.\n\nZverev needs a few steely serves, quieten the energy.\n\nHint of a sniff of a chance as Zverev serves at 30-30. RN takes the initiative, he knows that he has to swing for the fences here, Zverev on the back foot and he makes an error into the net. 30-40. Nadal gets the serve back and it creeps in.... Zverev unsettled, loses his timing, a poor shot, and Nadal wins the point with a drop shot! Nadal with a break of serve!\n\nThat's what I was saying about Rafa getting into Zverev's head. The huge celebration after saving break points brought the crowd to life. And then the Zverev forehand - always his shakier side - began to show a few cracks, leading to Nadal's first break of serve. Fans having a ball now. Although I should say they have been pretty sporting. Big applause for a Zverev forehand winner in the last game. I've been at Djokovic-Federer matches in New York where Djokovic hits a winner and there's tumbleweed\n\nNadal serve under real pressure here but he just about holds on. Crowd roaring him on now as he produces an ace at 30-40. Gets out of jail.\n\nA brace of aces in this Zverev hold.\n\nSome sporting royalty spotted in the crowd. Not just Manchester City's Rodri but two of the favourites for this title: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz. They clearly think it might be Nadal's French Open finale, even if he isn't sure.\n\nNadal with a determined hold in the second game, however. His cause helped by Zverev bungling a regulation overhead shot. Excellent point from Nadal at 40-0! Dogged defence into insisting ground strokes, then he picks a drop shot early, gets there, and puts it away for a winner. Fist pump and a roar!\n\nZverev will be looking to go up a gear here and break the back of the match early in the second set. A dominant service hold sends him onwards.\n\nIn his pre-tournament press conference, Nadal said \"If, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.\"\n\nI'm not sure this match has been \"beautiful\" thus far but it's warmed up into a decent spectacle. And, crucially, not one that embarrasses Nadal (although he has just walked off court for an early bathroom break). Certainly better than his most recent outing in Rome, a 6-1, 6-3 humbling at the hands of Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nThe critical stat so far is surely Zverev's 78 per cent first serves in.\n\nIt's deuce. Reaching for a crosscourt, Nadal finds the net. It's set point to the German. RN takes charge of the rally with hard, flat, aggressive groundstrokes and forces an error. A second deuce. But eventually Zverev wins the game and Zverev wins the first set.\n\nZverev wins first set 6-3, breaking Nadal in the first game and the ninth game of the opener. Nadal only got 58% of his first serves in.\n\nAnother hold from Zverev takes him to within a game of the first set.\n\nNadal holds. He looks like he is enjoying himself. He's moving Zverev around the court a bit more and he's getting into it. No doubt as to where the crowd's affections lie, and correctly so: Nadal, a legend, a gent. Zverev, well the less said the better.\n\nZverev's turn to hold his serve to love. Here's more from Briggsy:\n\n\"Zverev really settling to his work now, and hitting at an average of 83mph off both wings. Nadal way behind on 72 for his forehand and 74 for his backhand. That's a little misleading in a way, because his forehand has a spin-laden heaviness to it which makes the ball harder to deal with, even if it's not as quick through the air. But still a decisive difference.\"\n\nAfter a nervy three, three-and-a-half games, some signs that the players are settling in. Quite the occasion this. Up in the press box, there was an unseemly scramble for seats.\n\nNadal, hearteningly, holds his serve to love. It's raining in Paris by the way, although obviously we are under the roof on this court.\n\nZverev holds his serve.\n\nVital hold for Nadal, who is on the board. And perhaps encouraged by the fact that Zverev has made a couple of backhand errors in this game.\n\nBit of a delay because a couple of punters in the posh seats are moving around and causing distraction.\n\nThat's age for ya. Little drop shot from Zverev, not perfect and it sits up a bit. In his prime, Rafa would have hared over there, slid, and hit a winner. But today, he just gives it up when six or eight yards away, knowing that it would be a waste of energy.\n\nNadal wins the first two points of that game. When he can stand and deliver he still looks mighty but the court coverage is going to be the issue. If Sascha can play the man not the legend here, he should win with plenty in hand.\n\nNadal is up against is straight away. Zverev aggressive, direct, moving the Spanish veteran around and he's been very dominant there. Before you know it, it's 0-40 and, not that the great man needed telling, but he knows he's in a huge fight. Zverev takes the first of the three break points at his disposal.\n\nshirt with white shorts, his opponent in a shirt with a yellow front and white back. It's Nadal to serve first.\n\nA few boos ring out among the cheers as Alexander Zverev enters the stadium. The closed roof clearly favours Zverev, both because Nadal is the world's best windy-weather player (his heavy spin cuts through the breeze) and because Zverev has arguably the best serve in the game right now, which will only be enhanced by the lack of any wind to disrupt his ball-toss. He is landing a mind-boggling 74 per cent of his first serves this season, and unless Nadal gets in his head, I'd expect that figure to climb above 80 today.\n\nTo a rapturous reception, as you might imagine, and this could be a fantastic occasion. By the way, it's Alan Tyers here to talk you through the action.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage from the French Open in what could be Rafael Nadal's final match at Roland Garros.\n\nThe 14-time champion begins his campaign against Alexander Zverev, which is the standout match in the first round.\n\n\"It's not ideal the first match, because I feel competitive to have this match later in the tournament, but it's how it is,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to be ready since the beginning. Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories.\n\nZverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nAny plans to pay tribute to Nadal if he loses have been scuppered because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!

But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "newsadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsAdvance.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@newsadvance.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seed (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/newsadvance.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/36/6363dde4-9ffb-56d4-9855-062120200564/6653985a4ccc0.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1187, "textEnd": 1193}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

But if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not.

His opponents seem to agree with that sentiment.\n\nWorld No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, speaking to reporters in Paris on Friday, said he played a practice set against Nadal and noted that the Spaniard \"played better than in Madrid and Rome.\"\n\nNadal has won the French Open a record 14 times in his career.

I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organizers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nAs soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev leveled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal vs Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1, 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6 6-4 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from a early break down in the third set where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3 only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"},

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

Still, those plans have been put on hold after the legendary Spaniard said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the French Open. Nadal has won it 14 times. Tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nUnseeded Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, previously said he expects this to be his last season on the pro circuit after battling injuries for the better part of the previous 18 months.

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future.

Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia

Compatriot Alex Corretja reveals chat", "body": "Rafael Nadal aims to return for the Paris Olympics, keeping fans hopeful\n\nFormer World No.2 Alex Corretja reckons that legendary Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal may reconsider his French Open future after his opening round exit on Monday. Corretja revealed insights from his recent conversations with Nadal, indicating a significant shift in the 22-time Grand Slam champion's outlook. The 37-year-old Spaniard, who missed nearly all of 2023 due to injuries, was defeated in straight sets by fourth-seed German Alexander Zverev.\n\nZverev became only the third player to beat Nadal on the Parisian clay. In what could have been his final match at the tournament he dominated for almost two decades, Nadal exhibited flashes of his former brilliance. He has openly expressed his ambition to return to Roland Garros for this year's Paris Olympics. Additionally, Nadal has given his fans a glimmer of hope that he might extend his career a bit longer.\n\n\"I spoke to him a couple of months ago and he was sure he wouldn't be back (at the French Open),\" Corretja told Eurosport. \"But then I spoke to him a week ago, and he said to me it's the first time I've been practising here at Roland Garros that I feel no pain. He said he felt so good on the court and that his tennis is growing and doesn't see any reason why he can't come back at least one more time.\n\nNadal, who holds an astonishing 14 French Open titles, appears to be buoyed by his improved physical condition and promising practice sessions. Yet, he remains cautiously optimistic about his prospects. \"But he also said, it depends how I play. If I play awful against Zverev, maybe I won't come back. But the way he played, I believe he will think why not come back.\"\n\nWilander said the prospect of him playing at the Olympics was exciting. Nadal's level of tennis during his French Open defeat by Alexander Zverev on Monday was high enough to secure victory against the majority of players in the draw, according to former Roland Garros champion Mats Wilander.\n\n\"Obviously the Olympics are huge and for him to have the chance to play here on Philippe Chatrier is amazing and could be an unbelievable end to his career,\" Wilander told Eurosport. \"I think he beats 90% of the draw today. There's only a few guys that would beat him playing this well. And Zverev was the worst opponent possible in the first round, worse than playing (Novak) Djokovic, worse than playing (Carlos) Alcaraz.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c0lex_Corretja", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c0lex Corretja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Wilander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mats Wilander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/rafael-nadal-272830671-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=JQibdu9gktMkgN_caskUS_qre8CmhZ7o", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\nThat left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\n- Zverev's fast start -\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nMore from this section Federal Election Commission: Sen. Menendez paid $2M to Paul Hastings law firm, defense attorneys 'Poor weather conditions' cancels remainder of Bethpage Air Show at Jones Beach Diversity courses are 'obviously discriminatory' against white people and a 'big issue' in the UK - Jeremy Carl\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\n- Swiatek makes strong start -\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThe 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia

And why is he unseeded? - Sports", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

Also, some quickly started pointing out to Zverev coming off a Rome Masters win while Nadal had an inconsistent clay season that was full of question marks.\n\nWhile this is undoubtedly the most challenging situation Nadal has ever faced going into the French Open, some very promising updates dropped late in the week as the record 14-time Grand Slam champion apparently looked great in practice and didn't lose a single set there.\n\nAfter playing Nadal in practice and losing, Tallon Griekspoor said Nadal looked great - he heard the Spaniard beat others in practice as well - and also heard some commenting that this Nadal would win the title. Also, Nadal's coach Carlos Moya said this was the best the 37-year-old looked in practice in the last three months.\n\n\"The only thing I know is that in the corridors, he says to himself that in training he beat everyone, that he is playing very well again. We see members of his team making certain statements saying: 'Rafa, he's never been better, Rafa he's in great shape, Rafa he's like new...\" Tsonga said on Prime Video Sport France.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting to see how it goes give.

But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics but would almost certainly skip Wimbledon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It will be difficult playing on grass considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future,\" he added. \"I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nNadal was unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semifinal.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nZverev's fast start\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\nSwiatek makes strong start\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarterfinalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\nDaniil Medvedev had lost in the first round on five of his previous seven Roland Garros appearances, but made no mistake this time, seeing off Dominik Koepfer in four sets.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nBut sixth-seeded Greek Maria Sakkari bowed out in the first round for the second straight year with a three-set loss to Varvara Gracheva.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.", "source": {"uri":

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nAs for the Paris Olympics, which will hold the tennis competition at Roland Garros starting in two months? He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

I think so. The day of rest between the rounds is exactly what he needs. Then there are the five sets and that is another question that he himself cannot answer,\" the Swiss said on French television.\n\n\"But he had such an advantage in his best period that I still think he is capable of having a great Roland Garros.

What I see is someone who really tries to be on the court,\" Federer explained.\n\n\"If he says 'ciao', he will do it on a court and not on his couch, and I love that because he is very far from being 100%. It is such a personal decision that he has to choose. How he wants to do it, based on his body, as he honestly says.\n\n\"I don't know anything, but I would like it to end as he has decided, with his family and his team. I would like him to continue on the circuit a little longer than people believe.\n\n\"I have heard many things, that the end could be during this Roland Garros or after the Olympic Games or that he will still be here next year, which I really hope.

We had a taste of what it would be like in 2023 when the Spaniard was absent due to injury but a year ago, there was always the sense that he'd be back.\n\nThis year, the feeling that he'll return is nowhere near as strong and so we must begin preparing for Nadal departing Roland Garros for the last time.\n\nIt would, of course, be the fairytale ending if Nadal could win his fifteenth French Open title in a fortnight's time.\n\nAt first glance, such a suggestion seems entirely outlandish given the season he's had.\n\nThe 37-year-old's past year has been decimated by injury - he's played only four tournaments and not reached even a semi-final in any of them.\n\nHe's lost to players that, a few years ago, wouldn't have troubled him in the slightest, particularly on clay.\n\nAnd so logic suggests this French Open campaign will be less of a tilt at the title and more of a farewell to the tournament that has seen Nadal become as close to unbeatable as anyone has ever been in sport.\n\nCourt Philippe-Chatrier, on which Nadal has won all fourteen of his titles, has become the Mallorcan's second home.\n\nPeople talk about certain athletes having an aura in particular arenas and never has that been more true than Nadal at the French Open.\n\nOnly a select few players have ever had the belief they could defeat Nadal at Roland Garros, and even fewer have actually done it.\n\nAnd so this final swansong of Nadal's will truly be the end of an era.\n\nThe French Open as a tournament will go on without Nadal, but it will be years before his name stops being mentioned on a regular basis. In fact, it's likely his name will always be recalled on a regular basis on the grounds of Roland Garros as it's a certainty that his record of 14 French Open titles will never be surpassed.\n\nSuch consistency and long-lasting success in sport is unspeakably hard to achieve and while some claim it's boring to watch one person win title after title, I'd argue such prolonged greatness is infinitely more interesting to watch than the variability that comes with a different winner each year.\n\nMany people can win one title, fewer can win several and only one can win fourteen.\n\nThe odds are that Nadal won't win a fifteenth on his finale at Roland Garros. But the odds also were that no one would win fourteen titles and look what happened.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18117768/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Honestly, I am not 100 per cent sure.\n\n\"If it is the last time, then you, the crowd, have been amazing. Today the feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. For me, it is so special to feel the love in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match and last week, victory in Rome. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 [when Zverev broke his ankle in his semi-final defeat to Nadal at the French Open] was a tough moment for you and you deserve more, so all the best.\n\n\"For me, as I said before, I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros. It is true that the first round wasn't the ideal one. I needed something else! I was competitive, I had chances but it was difficult against a great player as Sasha.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to say about the future. There is a big percentage I won't be back at Roland Garros but I can't say 100 per cent. I am enjoying myself, I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe, in two months, I say it's enough, I can't give anything else. But that is something I don't feel yet. I have goals. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. That's going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court throughout my career, it's just unbelievable. When I was a kid I couldn't imagine being here at almost 38 with all of the success. Winning so many times, I couldn't dream about it.\n\n\"It has been a very beautiful process. All the memories are very special. All the people who are in Roland Garros behind the scenes helping me since I came here, and the support of my people. I can't thank them all enough.\n\n\"Last thing, all the people, the feelings you made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know.

Let's see.\"\n\nThe meeting will bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met, in a French Open semi-final in 2022, when Nadal went on to win yet another title in Paris, the last of his 22 Grand Slam victories.\n\nZverev was forced to retire from that match with an ankle injury. He underwent surgery and ended up missing the rest of the season with another injury, but he returned last year to reach his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith some of the other top players such as Novak Djokovic, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, struggling with injuries of late, this could be Zverev's chance to finally win a Grand Slam.\n\nThe German might not have wanted to meet Nadal so early in the tournament but he was happy to have the chance to take him on again.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here. I did not want to play him in the first round. I wanted to play him in the semi-finals, finals, a later stage of the tournament,\" Zverev said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's not seeded, it is how it is, and I think we're both prepared for a tough battle.\"\n\nWorld number two Sinner makes his return to action after sitting out the Italian Open following a hip injury at the Madrid Open, and takes on American Christopher Eubanks.\n\nIga Swiatek begins her title defence against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean, and the Polish world number one comes to Paris on the back of title wins in Madrid and Rome.\n\nAmerican third seed Coco Gauff plays 21-year-old qualifier Julia Avdeeva, with the Russian making her Grand Slam debut.\n\nReporting by Trevor Stynes; editing by Clare Fallon", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_stynes@reuters.com", "name": "Trevor Stynes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9olia_Jeanjean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9olia Jeanjean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eubanks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Eubanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JPW46ZVSNNNGDMUYLF4KYS5BBU.jpg?auth=e86b1a2b4ce6d8961ad5c69258944573554886c4178d26656e8b8b9e2c9a4d94&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent.\n\n\"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nIt was only Nadal's fifth tournament since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear, arriving in Paris a lowly 275th in the world rankings.\n\nThat left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round.\n\nGerman Zverev, who lifted the Rome Open title last month, proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories.\n\nThe 27-year-old banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final.\n\nHis reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\n- Zverev's fast start -\n\nZverev started the match strongly with a break to love in the opening game, going on to wrap up the first set with relative ease.\n\nNadal was much improved from his most recent outing, when he was well beaten by Hubert Hurkacz in the Rome second round, but failed to serve out the second set when leading 5-4.\n\nZverev then came out on top in a tense tie-break as a Nadal return found the net.\n\nThe Spaniard again broke first in the third set to lead 2-0, much to the delight of the 15,000 spectators in attendance, including Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, Swiatek and Manchester City footballer Rodri.\n\nBut Zverev quickly hit back once more, before breaking for a 4-3 lead with a wonderful passing winner.\n\nHe secured victory on his first match point as Nadal blazed a forehand off target, potentially ending the most dominant career at a single event in Grand Slam history.\n\n- Swiatek makes strong start -\n\nWomen's world number one Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.\n\nThe Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year.\n\nAustralian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner.\n\nFormer finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nWomen's third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1.\n\nThe 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32.\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.\n\njc/dj\n\nMore from this section\n\nCleanup Pro iOS App Launched: AI-Powered to Delete Duplicate Photos and Clean iPhone's Storage\n\nMeet a Scientologist Showcases Top Brass With Virtuoso

If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics in the city in July.\n\n\"I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared,\" he said to loud cheers.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\nHowever, he insisted on the eve of the tournament that he was \"100% keeping the door open\" on his future in a sport which has brought him 22 Grand Slam titles.\n\n'THANK YOU RAFA'\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour,\" said Zverev.\n\n\"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment.\"\n\nIn a repeat of the 2022 semifinal, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances.\n\nHe was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent.\n\nChants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule.\n\nThey subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game.\n\nNadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nIt was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn't back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set.\n\n'BEAUTIFUL PROCESS'\n\nA tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally.\n\nNadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set.\n\nHowever, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention.\n\nThe effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn't think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process,\" said Nadal before he left to a standing ovation.\n\nItalian world number two Jannik Sinner looked fully recovered from his injury problems as he saw off American Christopher Eubanks in the first round.\n\nThe Italian star eased to a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win under the new roof on Court Suzanne Lenglen as rain fell at Roland Garros.\n\nAustralian Open champion Sinner showed no signs of struggling with his fitness despite missing the recent Rome Open with a hip injury.\n\nThe Italian star struck 32 winners and broke Eubanks' serve five times as he set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\nSinner is playing only his third tournament since winning the Miami Masters in March, after losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the Monte Carlo Masters semifinals and then withdrawing from the Madrid Open before his quarterfinal match.\n\nHis victory on Monday took his win-loss record for the season to 29-2.\n\nThe 22-year-old is hoping to improve on his best French Open performance - a run to the quarterfinals on his debut in 2020.\n\nAmerican Eubanks enjoyed a breakthrough Wimbledon last year when he was beaten by Daniil Medvedev in the last eight in five sets, but has now lost seven consecutive matches.\n\nTSITSIPAS CRUISES INTO SECOND ROUND\n\nFormer runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas kicked off his campaign with a no-nonsense 7-6 (9-7) 6-4 6-1 victory over Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\nThe ninth-seeded Greek, who won the Monte Carlos Masters this year, showed his range of qualities on clay to set up a second-round meeting with German Daniel Altmaier.\n\nSporting a black and yellow outfit, Tsitsipas ended his opponent's resistance in a one-sided third set.\n\nThe 25-year-old wrapped up victory when Fucsovics sent a return wide under the roof on Court Suzanne Lenglen.\n\nSHELTON BEATS LOCAL HOPE GASTON\n\nAmerican Ben Shelton won his first match at the French Open as he overcame Frenchman Hugo Gaston 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4, not only surviving two interruptions from the Paris rain but also the wrath of the local fans.\n\nLoud chants of \"Hugo, Hugo\" echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton's fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter.\n\n\"This was a pretty amazing atmosphere, honestly. This is the first time that I've come out to a tennis match and had a band playing in the stands on my court, so I think that was pretty special,\" Shelton told a press conference.\n\n\"I love these moments. I enjoy these atmospheres. I got a lot of heckling when I was in college tennis, but today the crowd was just loud, chanting, supporting their countryman. It's something that you love to see. There was a lot of positives out there,\" he added.\n\nThe 21-year-old Shelton, who burst onto the scene last year when he reached the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park and the semis at the US Open, likened the atmosphere to an American football match and said he used to get booed at his college games.\n\n\"It's a big motivator when you hear the chants and cheers whenever you make an unforced error, but also, there was so much energy for me, which made it awesome,\" he said.\n\n\"Sometimes it's tough when it's completely silent when you hit a good shot, and they're going nuts every time that you miss, but here it was a little bit more even. Obviously, he had the home field advantage, but I felt some love out there,\" he added.\n\nShelton will play Kei Nishikori, who beat Gabriel Diallo 7-5 7-6(3) 3-6 1-6 7-5, in the second round.\n\nMONFILS MARCHES ON, NORRIE STUNNED\n\nHome favourite Gael Monfils needed four sets to edge Brazil's Thiago Seyboth Wild 6-2 3-6 6-3 6-4.\n\nThe 37-year-old Frenchman will next face Italian 30th seed Lorenzo Musetti in the second round.\n\nRussia's Pavel Kotov, meanwhile, bounced back from a 2-1 set deficit to upset Briton 32nd seed Cameron Norrie 4-6 6-3 3-6 7-6(5) 6-2 and set up a clash against former French Open champion Stan Wawrinka in the second round.\n\nMEDVEDEV THROUGH IN FOUR SETS\n\nRussian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev overcame a third-set wobble to beat German Dominik Koepfer 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 in barely more than three hours to close out day 2 in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "supersport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SuperSport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The German dominated the proceedings from the very beginning, looking fitter and fresher than Nadal, who has battled multiple injuries this year.\n\nAs chants of \"Rafa, Rafa\" reverberated at the Philippe Chatrier court, Zverev quickly set the pace, breaking Nadal to love in the first game. The German then stretched his lead to 3-1 by saving two break points.\n\nNadal saved two set points on his own serve at 3-5 but concedes the opening set on the third when his forehand crashed into the net. Zverev was clearly the dominant player in the first set, hitting 15 winners to Nadal's five.\n\nIn the second set too, Nadal's serve was under pressure.

The duo will meet in an opening round blockbuster on Court Philippe-Chatrier on Monday.\n\nZverev secured the Italian Open title earlier this month and the 27-year-old German reached the semi-finals at the French Open in each of the last three years.\n\nThe pair faced off in the last four at Roland Garros in 2022, when Zverev suffered a horrific ankle injury that ended his season.\n\nNadal was leading 7-6 (8), 6-6 in a brutal encounter that had already lasted over three hours, before Zverev's injury caused him to leave the court in a wheelchair.\n\nRead More: Boris Becker's warning for Alexander Zverev ahead of French Open showdown with Rafael Nadal\n\nThe 37-year-old Spaniard played eight matches across Barcelona, Madrid and Rome prior to what could be his last French Open appearance.\n\nIn an interview with atptour.com, Moya explained that Nadal is now ready to commit to giving everything physically on court after his recent injury issues.\n\n\"There will be no holding back now. Rafa will play to the death, at 100 per cent, giving his all. We're in a new situation: five-set matches. He hasn't done that for two years, but we think he's ready,\" the Moya said.\n\n\"There's no more risk than there was in Brisbane or any other tournament. If something happens to him it's not for a lack of practice or matches.\n\n\"It will be because of an exertion that his body hasn't been able to cope with, but we're confident nothing should happen.\"\n\nMoya recognised Nadal had been given one of the worst possible draws, but expressed that the tennis great is feeling positive.\n\n\"Of course, it's one of the worst opponents he could get. He's coming in in great shape, no injuries and confident. And he just won in Rome. It was always something that could happen,\" explained the Spaniard.\n\n\"Considering the fact that Rafa is unseeded, the draws have been kind until now, fair. This time it was the worst that could happen.\n\n\"We were hoping for a draw that would allow him to find his rhythm and confidence gradually. But the circumstances are different. We got Zverev and we have to approach it in the best way possible.\n\n\"He is raring to go, and has a very positive attitude. For our part, we know where we are and who we're with. You hold onto that. It's going to be a very tough, well-fought match. If Rafa can play at the level he has been in practice... why not think positive?\"\n\nThe 1998 French Open champion conceded, though, that it would have been preferable to avoid a player of Zverev's level in the early rounds.\n\n\"As deep as possible [in the draw would have been better]. That would mean Rafa would have won matches and he would have momentum. I don't think it's positive playing Zverev in the first round, honestly.

I hope to be back on this track before the Olympic Games, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will be the third time since his Roland Garros debut in 2005 that Nadal, whose body has been tortured by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a shattered foot after his record-breaking 14th title two years ago, will not be allowed to celebrate his birthday on 3 celebrating June in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive fashionably late on the Philippe Chatrier court after a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, as usual with racket in hand, left the court to a deafening roar stepped up.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during the warm-up and placing his two bottles aimed diagonally at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organizers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a field he knows better than anyone, Nadal struggled early on to find his goal. He hit a routine drop shot and served a double fault, giving Zverev the opening match.\n\nThe German, who was the worst possible draw for Nadal after winning the Rome Masters, kept his foot on the accelerator to take the first set, even though the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a pair of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nHowever, once Zverev eased the pressure, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" the crowd cheered again as world number one Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set, but Zverev leveled and forced a tiebreak, which he won comfortably.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I can still do it' fist pumps after a pair of jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was this times too good.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of Nadal's clash with Zverev as Swiatek, chasing a fourth title here, started her campaign with a 6-1, 6-2 defeat of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris, following back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, beating Germany's Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th win in a Grand Slam match.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year by breaking her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, now representing France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6 6-4 6-3 win.\n\nOn the men's side, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, extended his stay at Roland Garros this time with a 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 victory over the German Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably take the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from an early break in the third set, where Medvedev's attempt to force a tiebreak was thwarted when the German broke a break serve to take the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to grant the Russian a break to open the fourth set, but only got back on serve at 3-3, allowing Medvedev to close out the final match of the day on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three win matches.\n\nIn other men's play, second-seeded Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner defeated American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just as former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

Reuters\n\nThe last six weeks had built up to it. Barcelona, Madrid and then Rome. The last week in Paris had built up to it. The little uncertainty was removed on Thursday. The tension and excitement was palpable. Play at Roland Garros, the second Grand Slam of the year, began on Sunday, was interrupted, and then ended. The sun rose amid cloud cover in the French capital on Monday. Thousands came through the gates, as they do year after year. But this was no ordinary day.\n\nOns Jabeur stepped up first on Court Philippe Chatrier and earned a straight-set victory. As did defending champion Iga Swiatek after taking just an hour to solidify her credentials as a title favourite. Then was the moment of truth, what everyone had been waiting for. What the 15,000 or so had paid good money for. This prized ticket - which was going for nearly a thousand euros on some websites. What people from all over - Europe, Oceania, North America, and South America - had come to see. To watch Rafael Nadal play maybe his last French Open match.\n\nYou could understand the emotion and frenzy of the occasion. Nadal had last played on this court two years ago when he lifted the trophy. This was where he had won 14 of his 22 Grand Slam trophies - no player has won more at one major. Put Novak Djokovic out of the equation and the rest of the singles field hasn't even won that many COMBINED. Tennis fans wanted to be present when Nadal, 112-3 at the French Open, said his goodbye at a tournament that helped define his legacy.\n\nIt wasn't just the fans who wanted to be part of this moment. Djokovic, who is in action on Tuesday, was in attendance. As was Carlos Alcaraz who moved into the second round on Sunday. Not surprisingly, Nadal fan Swiatek also quickly made her way back to the stadium. Occupying the top-tier seats were Alize Cornet and Caroline Garcia. Former players David Ferrer and Marion Bartoli were in their places too. In the player's boxes sat Nadal's uncle Toni, who used to be his coach.\n\nThe situation was hardly of Nadal's liking, though. Still working his way back from two years of hip and abdominal injuries, the World No. 275 had drawn fourth seed Alexander Zverev in a brutal draw. To top it off, persistent rain meant the roof had to be closed which meant disadvantage Rafa. Jannik Sinner, who had won earlier in the day, said in his assessment, \"The situation is a bit different because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colder today. The ball isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bouncing that much. Also they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re playing indoors. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be interesting\u00e2\u20ac| Rafa won so many times here. He knows every single spot on the court.\"\n\nWhen Nadal made his way to the court, the noise was relentless. Thousands belted out \"Rafa! Rafa!\" and roared their support for the Spaniard as he stepped up for the coin toss. As he swung his fierce topspin forehand during the warmup. Or muscled the two-handed backhand. Master of ceremonies Marc Maury did the lengthy rundown of each of Nadal's French Open winning years. As it went on and on for 14 years, the decibel level continued to rise.\n\nThe problem, though, was that there just wasn't enough of the brilliance of the past. There weren't enough vintage forehands and backhands to extend the eventual three-hour contest. There were moments of brilliance like consecutive games in the second set with clutch tennis - first to hold serve with a forehand winner that was celebrated with a leap, punch and scream of \"Vamos!\".\n\nIn the next game, Nadal would hit a pinpoint drop shot to catch Zverev off guard for the first break. There were the usual celebratory uppercuts that have become so familiar with Rafa from the days of sleeveless T-shirts and capri pants to Monday's sky-blue sleeves and white shorts. Every pumped celebration was matched by the capacity crowd with applause, throwing fists of their own, or waving the Spanish flag.\n\nBut there were moments where Nadal would get broken in the 10th game while serving for the set. And then lose a 19-shot rally in a nervous tiebreaker.\n\nEven if Nadal was scintillating at the net with some breathtaking volleys, there just were not enough free points on a weary and slowed serve. The Spaniard won just 58 percent of his first serve points compared to Sascha's 72 percent. Zverev had a chance at 18 break points and converted six of them with aggressive forehands and by painting the line in key moments.\n\nIn the third set, Nadal had to fend off four break points to stay ahead. But the challenge proved far too much on the next service game. Not long after, Nadal sent a tired forehand wide to go down 3-6, 6-7, 3-6 in the first round.\n\nWith the result, Zverev became only the third player to beat Nadal at the French Open. It is the first time Rafa has bowed out at a French Open earlier than the fourth round. It took the Spaniard's win-loss to 112-4. It was only Nadal's third first-round defeat at a Grand Slam in an illustrious career. It is the first time he's lost two straight matches on clay - following the loss to Hubert Hurkacz in Rome.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard , whose young son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know (if) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m 28,\u00e2\u20ac Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!\u00e2\u20ac\n\nIs this the end for Rafa? It remains unclear. Before the tournament began he said it wasn't 100% he was done . During the on-court speech he reiterated that this might just be it but he left the door ajar. It bears resemblance to Serena Williams at 2022 US Open who also drew massive crowds and was feted by tournament organisers.\n\nWhen asked in the press conference if he would play Wimbledon, Nadal suggested the switch from clay to grass and then again to clay for the Paris Olympics, to be played at this very site, would be too much.\n\nBack to the present.\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said on the court: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Merci beaucoup.\u00e2\u20ac\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the last time that I played here,\u00e2\u20ac he went on, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am at peace with myself.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room. A sliver of sunshine crept through the stadium's roof and onto the court and Nadal - as if the two had intertwined over all these years - as he walked off into the sunset amid one final chant of \"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score":

There's his fishing gear, which he brings to the shore to savor \"the calm and tranquility, the beauty of the sea.\" There's his wife Mar\u00eda Francisca, who he met in 2005, the same year he won his first French Open. And there's his one-year-old son Rafael (Jr.), who carries a miniature racket and a patrilineal frown wherever he goes. This life seems far, far away from the life he's had for more than twenty years -- one that has carried the aging Nadal through punishing cycles of elite competitive tennis, and to the extreme reaches of ecstasy and despair.\n\nBut to enjoy the promise of a new life, Nadal has to be reborn, and in order to be reborn, Nadal first has to die.\n\nFor Nadal, the red clay of the French Open, his favored killing ground, is the perfect place to die. After falling to Alex de Minaur in an early round at Barcelona in April, Nadal seemed to recognize that it was nearly time. \"It wasn't today that I had to leave everything and die; in Paris, let it be what God wants,\" he said.\n\nThat time is now here, in the last week of May, during a tournament that he has won 14 times in a sport where most careers don't last 14 years. In the last two decades, the French Open has become akin to a blood ritual where 128 of the world's best tennis players fight for the honor of eventually getting flattened by Nadal's heavy, destructive topspin forehands (or the mere threat of one.) Only two players have ever survived against him there: Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021, and a white-hot Robin S\u00f6derling in 2009. It is because Nadal has won 112 matches at the French Open that those three losses, all of which were avenged, stand out so prominently.\n\nNadal is old, by tennis standards. He has been for at least five years. And he is carrying hip and abdominal injuries that have slowed him down since 2022 and might spell the end of his career in 2024. After a medical recovery period that left him sidelined from most tournaments, Nadal is entering his potentially last French Open as an unseeded player. For the first time in a long while, his victory does not feel inevitable; he might not even make it past the first round.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nFor his opening foray, Nadal drew a meeting with world no. 4 Alexander Zverev, a man 11 years younger than Nadal and whose aggressive, penetrating baseline power was once marred by a tendency to sink his serves into the net. Not anymore -- since recovering from a rolled ankle in 2022 (that he sustained while battling Nadal to the precipice), he has found new form, blasting 90% of his first serves in during a successful championship run at the Rome Masters 1000 tournament last week. It's an ominous sign for Nadal, who hasn't beaten a top-10 player yet this year.\n\nBut Zverev's ranking isn't the only reason why tennis watchers fell to their knees at the supermarket. The German stands accused of domestic abuse against his ex-girlfriend, and his lack of contrition only confirmed some people's views that he had always been arrogant, hypocritical, and violent. When Netflix decided to feature Zverev in their tennis docuseries \"Break Point\" without mentioning the abuse case, critics accused the producers of whitewashing. If Nadal was going to symbolically pass the torch to anyone at the end of his career, many would wish it was \"anyone but Zverev.\"\n\nNadal, on the other hand, is generally beloved not only for his numerical achievements, but also an endearing and authentic personality that has proven more than generous to meme-makers. His exhilarating, nerve-scorching playing style, underrated craft, and indomitable willpower has bound his fate to the hearts of millions, many of whom can signpost their own lives with the victories and defeats they witnessed him endure, and endured with him. The Spaniard has some controversies of his own, but in the last hours before what might be his final hunt on Philippe-Chatrier, all seems forgiven, for now.\n\nThough Nadal sees the end in sight, he can't be sure whether it will happen tomorrow, or maybe another day (or even, remotely, next year.) Maybe he'll perform a miracle and keep going into the second week. Injuries didn't prevent him from storming through the 2022 French Open on one foot. But for now, the only world that matters is the one he'll share with Alexander Zverev and a crowd of spectators who will be firmly in his corner.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topspin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Topspin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprained_ankle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprained ankle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/05/rafael-nadal-2154007068jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The German is serving big and cracking his forehand to keep Nadal from taking the initiative in rallies.\n\nTwo years ago, the pair clashed in the semi-finals on the same court. That match appeared to be a classic in the making -- more than three hours in before the end of the second set -- when Zverev suffered a devastating ankle injury that kept him out for the rest of the 2022 season. Nadal went on to claim his 14th Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\nThis is the Spaniard's first match on Court Philippe-Chatrier since triumphing in 2022. He is 112-3 at Roland Garros and has not lost to someone other than Novak Djokovic at the tournament since 2009 (Robin Soderling).\n\nBut Nadal has struggled with injuries over the past couple of years and tallied a 5-3 record this clay-court season entering Roland Garros, below his lofty standards. The shocker of the draw ceremony came when the lefty was drawn to face the fourth-seeded Zverev in the first round.\n\nThe fans have tried to urge on Nadal, roaring after every point he has won. But the 37-year-old has not yet found an answer for Zverev's aggressive play. The two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion has taken the action to his opponent, hitting 15 winners compared to five for Nadal in the first set.\n\nAnd when the 22-time major champion has been in position to crank up his forehand in neutral rallies, Zverev has not panicked and has done well to neutralise Nadal's typically effective ad-court pattern with his steady two-handed backhand.\n\nZverev is also confident on the back of his title victory at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. Nadal leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 7-3.", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_des_Mousquetaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coupe des Mousquetaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/27/13/48/zverev-nadal-roland-garros-2024-monday-net.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts.\n\n\"But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nUnseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros.\n\nBut Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd.\n\nThe Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not \"close the door\" on a return to the Paris showpiece.\n\nIt seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nNadal added: \"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no?

The then third seed was in the ascendance but twisted his ankle during the second set and was forced to retire. Nadal went on to claim a 14th title.\n\nFast forward two years and following his health issues, Nadal, 37, has plummeted to 276 in the world rankings while Zverev has returned from the injury to recover his stature on the circuit and a fourth-place ranking on the ATP lists. He underlined his clay court credentials last week with victory at the Italian Open.\n\nAnd the fourth seed was gifted Nadal's opening service game of the encounter.\n\nThe Spaniard fluffed a drop shot, served a double fault, watched Zverev unleash his first forehand winner and then plopped a backhand into the net.\n\nZverev held his own service to lead 2-0 and he maintained his advantage before taking Nadal's service for a second time to claim the opener after 51 minutes.\n\nNadal - feeding off the energy of he crowd - hustled his way back into the tie. Some trademark fist pumps after rasping winners fired up his admirers.\n\nBut Zverev played deadpan. He clenched his fist briefly after Nadal failed to serve out the second set.\n\nAnd then stayed calm to stave off two points to give Nadal a 6-5 lead.\n\nIn the tiebreak, a bravura forehand winner on the run brought Nadal to within a point of Zverev at 4-5 but then a poorly executed drop shot gave Zverev two set points.\n\nNadal saved one with another drop shot but Zverev won the next point on the back of a 202km first serve to take control of the match after one our and 48 minutes.\n\nChance\n\nThe arena sensed a classic in the offing when Nadal got the early break in the third set to lead 2-0. But the expectation evaporated when he failed to consolidate and was reined in.\n\nOnce Zverev claimed Nadal's service again, his belief grew as the fans urged a last hurrah from Nadal.\n\nZverev's 14th backhand winner secured the point for a 5-3 lead and another helped him to the first point of Nadal's attempt to stay in the match.\n\nNadal failed.\n\n\"I am not sure if it's the last time that I'll be here,\" Nadal told the on-court interviewer Marc Maury. \"But if it is i enjoyed it.

NBC and streaming service Peacock begin their Monday coverage of the French Open at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nEuropean viewers can catch the action on Eurosport, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nNadal has won Roland Garros 14 times - the most of any player by a comfortable margin - and possesses an incredible 112-3 record at the tournament.\n\n\"You win it five times, that's a lot,\" tennis great Boris Becker recently told CNN Sport. \"You win it 10 times, it's impossible. Nadal's won it 14 times. I don't know any other record in any other sport that equals that.\"\n\nCurrently blocking his path towards an unthinkable 15th title though is former world No. 2 Zverev, widely tipped as one of the favorites to win the tournament in Paris.\n\nThe German is a proficient clay court player and is fresh off winning his sixth Masters 1000 title in Rome earlier this month. He has struggled against Nadal in the past, however, holding a 3-7 record against the legendary Spaniard. The last meeting between the pair came in the French Open semifinals in 2022, where Zverev suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year.\n\nThough speculation remains rampant that this could be the last time Nadal appears at Roland Garros as an active player, the 22-time grand slam singles champion told the media that he was not willing to close the door on competing in 2025.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not because I cannot predict what's going on - I hope you understand,\" he said ahead of the tournament.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

I need to analyse so many facts.\n\n\"But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nUnseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros.\n\nBut Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd.\n\nThe Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not \"close the door\" on a return to the Paris showpiece.\n\nIt seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nNadal added: \"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no? I think if that's the last time that I'm gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it's normal.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.\"\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nZverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mnPcjARtWCFWKOiiIjTBlw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa-sport.com/3e68e74bc47921e66bc652247a2c1699", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Was this his last at Roland Garros?", "body": "In 50 years, in 100 years, for as long as this earth is spinning and they play a tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros, the display listing its men's champions will never cease to be a marvel of human endurance and brilliance.\n\nImagine what our future descendants will think, what questions they will ask, when they look at that name listed 14 times.\n\nHow did Rafael Nadal Perera do it? What kind of physical mastery and mental desire did it take to dominate a Grand Slam from his teenage years until his late 30s? And did it end by his own choice, or did time finally tell the great Spaniard, \"no mas?\"\n\nThe first two questions will always be part history, part mystery. The third was answered Monday - not yet definitively, but symbolically. Even on his favorite surface, at his favorite tournament, one of the game's best players of yesterday was no match for one of the game's best players of today.\n\nIn the first round of the French Open, Alexander Zverev beat Nadal, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3. The legend walked to the net, shook hands with Zverev and sat down on the bench. He was called to the microphone to say what was probably a goodbye. And then he walked off Court Philippe-Chatrier having lost for just the fourth time in 116 matches there, knowing it's a feeling both he and a sport that adores him will probably never experience together again.\n\n\"Is difficult for me to talk,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's the last time I'm going to be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I'm not 100 percent sure, but if it's last time I enjoy it, no?\"\n\nNobody on a tennis court has ever been more relentless than Nadal. But he's also a realist caught between a desire to keep competing and a nearly 38-year old body that has been telling him for a few years it's time to finally stop.\n\nThe simple act of hitting the ball is still there, still pure, still devastating. But tennis, especially at the highest level of the sport, isn't just hitting a ball. It's a game that hinges on the smallest of margins; mere percentage points of movement and ability to change directions and hit the shots that steal fractions of a second from opponents.\n\nMaintaining those things over the course of years as the muscles and joints deteriorate becomes more and more difficult. And then, those small percentage points are just gone. Even the greats eventually get exposed.\n\nNadal has pushed it off, often successfully, for a long time. When he won the French Open two years ago for his 22nd Grand Slam title, he took injections that essentially put one of his feet to sleep so that he didn't feel the chronic pain brought on by a degenerative condition he's suffered with since he was 19.\n\nThen, a few weeks later, he had to withdraw from the semifinals at Wimbledon due to an abdominal injury. And the harsh truth is we haven't seen the old Nadal on a tennis court since.\n\nHis attempts to come back since then have all been undone either by more injuries, rust or poor play caused by a combination of both. It is sad and cruel in some ways, especially for someone who wants to fight through everything, but it's what happens after two decades of pushing a body to its limits.\n\nNadal actually played very well against Zverev, probably as well as he physically could. He made it difficult and created a few opportunities to grab momentum that could have maybe led to something special. He asked a lot of questions that Zverev found answers for.\n\nThat's both the good news and bad news for Nadal, as he contemplates how much more to give. He can still play, and on occasion play quite well. But when you're an athlete who is no longer able to dictate what happens in a tennis match against the people you used to beat, what are you?\n\n\"I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha,\" Nadal said. \"For me, it's difficult to say what's going on in the future.\"\n\nBecause his game and his body have felt progressively better over the last couple months, Nadal will most likely continue onto Wimbledon and the Olympics, which will be contested on the Roland Garros grounds.\n\nHe's signed up to play the Laver Cup, the team event in the fall where his rival and friend Roger Federer played his last official match in 2022. He's left open the possibility of coming back to Paris next year, which is why he told tournament officials he didn't want a full ceremony now. Even though so many things are telling Nadal he's had enough, there's still part of him that wants more.\n\n\"Maybe in two months, I say, 'It's enough, no? I can't give anything else,'\" he said. \"But it's something I don't feel yet.\"\n\nWhatever this last chapter looks like and no matter how much of it remains, Monday's match was the hard break between what Nadal was and what is he now. There are no more illusions, no more what-ifs and no more miracles. Even at Roland Garros, the fountain of youth does not exist.\n\nNone of us usually get to write the ideal ending to our lives or careers or goals, and Nadal is no exception. He understands this better than most because he has forever been among the most human superstars in sports: Empathetic to everyone, respectful to the game and fully aware that even if he is one of the great tennis players of all time, he's merely a tennis player. There are more important things in the world than hitting a fuzzy yellow ball.\n\nAt the same time, his job for the last two decades was also important. Without the kind of hope, joy and inspiration that a great athlete like Nadal can provide, this planet is a tiny bit lesser of a place.\n\nA century from now, it may be hard to fully grasp what that meant. But those 14 titles will still stand as a sporting achievement to be admired forever.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_racing_(motorsport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endurance racing (motorsport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u1kcf.XKMBihSt0lBPPSHw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/d515465b1d66c02916767d665d0cbf2e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

So what can I do? That's the draw.

He has been out injured. He hasn't played a lot of tennis. His ranking is where it is. Of course it's not ideal, but at the same time, you know, there is nothing you can do.\n\n\"Everybody now is excited for a tough battle and tough first round. I think he's excited and I'm excited for it.\"\n\nFrench Open organisers were prepared to stage a tribute ceremony to Nadal to honour his career but the Spaniard was reluctant to endorse such a celebration.\n\n\"We were ready to press the button on it,\" admitted tournament director Amelie Mauresmo.\n\n\"But it's Rafa who manages his timing, we follow what he wants.

For sure I'm proud of my achievements,\" said Swiatek. \"It's always been my favourite surface. It is where tennis gives me the most pleasure.\"\n\n\"Comparing me to him, I don't think I am on that level yet. I still have many things to prove. I'm just at the beginning.\"\n\nOn May 26, Osaka swept to her first victory at the French Open in three years on May 26, beating Italy's 48th-ranked Lucia Bronzetti on the showpiece Court Philippe Chatrier, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5.\n\nThe 26-year-old fired 31 winners, including six aces, and 45 unforced errors in a match where she gave up a 4-0 lead in the decider before finding herself 5-4 down.\n\nHowever, she rallied strongly to register her first win at a Grand Slam since the 2022 Australian Open.\n\nElsewhere in the women's draw, eighth seed Ons Jabeur began her latest attempt to win an elusive Grand Slam title with a comfortable 6-3, 6-2 victory over American wildcard Sachia Vickery.\n\nMeanwhile, Coco Gauff made a strong start in her bid to win a maiden French Open title as she eased past German world No. 208 Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nIn overnight matches, Andy Murray, runner-up at Roland Garros in 2016 and still the only British man to make the final since 1937, lost 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 to Wawrinka.\n\nWawrinka becomes only the third man over the age of 39 to win a match at the French Open since 1980.\n\n\"My first words are for a great champion,\" Wawrinka said of Murray, after their 23rd career meeting.\n\nMurray, 37, said he's proud of his French Open career even if \"when you compare it to what Rafa or Novak achieved, it obviously is minuscule\".\n\n\"But most players would sign up for the results I've had. I played a final, four semis - I lost to Novak in five, Stan in five, twice to Rafa. No shame in that.\"\n\nIn the women's draw, Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 champion, swept past Jaqueline Cristian while former Australian Open winner and 2020 Roland Garros runner-up Sofia Kenin came back from a set down to defeat Laura Siegemund of Germany.\n\nHowever, 2021 champion Barbora Krejcikova was knocked out 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 by Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland.\n\nKrejcikova has suffered three successive first-round losses in Paris since her title breakthrough.

It was an emotional day for the 14-time champion who was not able to contain his emotion after the match.\n\nThere were speculations that this would be the last grand slam of Nadal, and it was attended by stars like Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek. But it looks like the Spaniard has not been satisfied yet.\n\nAfter the match, he stated that he is not '100 percent sure' whether this will be his last appearance. The 37-year-old last won the Roland Garros back in 2022 and has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries for a while now.\n\nBlockbuster Match\n\nIt was a sensational match where World No.4 Alexander Zverev defeated Nadal in straight sets 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. Nadal showed glimpses of his vintage brilliance at several moments but was not able to keep it going throughout the matches.\n\nZverev has now become only the third player after Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic to defeat the 'King Of Clay' in his backyard. The crowd was firmly behind Nadal and the chants of 'Rafa-Rafa' took over the court.\n\nFrench Open 2024: Emotional Farewell?\n\nNadal was emotional after the match and was visibly in tears. His wife Maria Francisca Perello attended the match alongside his son. Maria was also emotional and could not stop her tears.\n\nNadal stated that he is not sure whether he would like to walk away yet. He loves this place and enjoys playing there. His body is better than before and he is still not feeling the end.\n\nNadal stated \"I'm not 100% sure if it's the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd was amazing during the whole week of preparation and today. The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. I enjoy playing a lot and traveling with the family.

Nadal had not been seeded lower than sixth in his 18 previous Roland Garros appearances.\n\nThe 22-time Grand Slam champion's astonishing record of 14 French Open triumphs is the highest number of titles any player has won at a single Grand Slam event in tennis history.\n\nRead More: Roger Federer assesses Rafael Nadal's French Open chances as he shares retirement wish\n\nMcEnroe, a seven-time Major singles champion, argued Nadal's incredible achievements at Roland Garros warrant him being seeded this year.\n\n\"It makes no sense that someone who has won 14 times is not seeded. It is the way the tournament has always acted. For me it is crazy,\" the American told the media, as quoted by Marca.\n\n\"It is the most interesting first round of a Major that I remember and the most tough [in the] Open Era for someone like Nadal.\"\n\n\"He has to do whatever he wants. He loves to compete and if he loses to Zverev it does not mean that all his records at Roland Garros will be lost. Maybe his time has come to be a father and everyone's time has come.\n\n\"Maybe I'm wrong and he'll be able to do something special here. It's a question mark as to how his body will recover as the rounds go by.\n\n\"On the one hand it will be a surprise, and on the other it won't. People like him, Novak or Roger are Superman.\"\n\nThe 77-time ATP singles titlist also assessed that three-time French Open semi-finalist Zverev is a genuine contender to win the title.\n\n\"[Zverev] has a real chance of winning in Paris if he focuses solely and exclusively on tennis and not on other things off the court.

The two will meet in the first round at Roland Garros on Monday. Michel Euler/Associated Press\n\nA word of advice to those time-conscious viewers who tune into tennis's major tournaments only in the second week, when the fourth round or quarterfinals begin: Adjust your schedules this year. The French Open, which begins Sunday in Paris, will make it worth your while.\n\nThere are treasures buried in these early rounds sure to stir even the casual fan.\n\nTwo of the seven major champions in the men's draw will face each other when Andy Murray, 37, and Stan Wawrinka, 39, each with three majors to their name, meet in a first-round time machine of a match. And reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner will drag his injured hip into Roland Garros to play last year's Wimbledon darling Chris Eubanks in the first round as well.\n\nIn the women's draw, a pair of four-time major champions could meet in the second round should both Iga Swiatek, the overwhelming favorite to win her fourth French Open title, and Naomi Osaka triumph in their opening matches.\n\nAnd still none of that compares to what the draw plopped at Rafael Nadal's feet.\n\nWhat is expected to be the final French Open of the Spaniard's career will begin Monday with a match against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev, the German who is one of a handful of good bets to win a wide-open tournament despite the fact that he will be playing while a domestic abuse hearing begins at the end of this month in Berlin. He is charged with assaulting a former girlfriend during an argument in 2020, denies the charges and continues to play because there is no specific policy in tennis regarding punishment for domestic abuse charges. He said in a pretournament news conference Friday the trial is \"not at all\" on his mind because he believes in the German court system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZverev learned of his match with Nadal after a practice session Thursday when his brother told him.\n\n\"I actually thought he's joking in the beginning,\" Zverev said Friday.\n\nNo joke. Zverev will face the 37-year-old titan with a record 14 titles at Roland Garros and, oh yeah, a statue near the grounds' entrance. Nadal has never lost in the first round there, but he has never faced a top-five seed so early.\n\nThe pair will meet on footing so unequal they might as well be standing on the slope of a mountain.\n\nNadal returns to Roland Garros having missed the tournament last year for the first time since 2005 because of a hip injury. After missing most of 2023 and playing in only four tournaments this year, his ranking has dipped to No. 276 and he is unseeded for the first time. In three clay-court events in April and May, he had two second-round exits and one fourth-round defeat. He has long said the 2024 season will be his last.\n\nZverev, meanwhile, is 28-9 in singles matches this year and won the Italian Open in Rome last week with his deft touch, snappy power and fluid mobility on full display. Despite his success, he is mentally preparing to play Nadal the 22-time Grand Slam champion, not Nadal the limping veteran. The Spaniard still has the strongest willpower in tennis no matter his physical state, and plenty of impending retirees have rattled off improbable runs at major tournaments with less.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" Zverev said.\n\nIf he is, Nadal will be one of the few big names in the men's draw who could say that. He is far from the only top player whose health is in question entering the tournament, and as a result the men's field is truly open for the first time in 20 years. The women? Not so much. Top-seeded Swiatek leads women's tennis's burgeoning big three alongside second-seeded and reigning Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka and fourth-seeded Elena Rybakina - together, the trio have won six of the past eight Grand Slam titles. Third-seeded Coco Gauff, a 2022 French Open finalist and reigning U.S. Open champion, lurks as a threat as well.\n\nSwiatek will be difficult to topple. The defending champion arrives in Paris on a 12-match winning streak and is looking to become the first woman since Serena Williams in 2013 to win titles in Madrid, Rome and Roland Garros.\n\nThe men are in varying states of disarray.\n\nThird-seeded Carlos Alcaraz is dealing with a right forearm issue that forced him to miss clay-court tournaments in Barcelona, Monte Carlo and Rome. Sinner, the No. 2 seed, pulled out of his quarterfinal match in Madrid after injuring his hip and skipped his home tournament, the Italian Open. Casper Ruud, the No. 7 seed and a French Open finalist in 2022 and 2023, has complained of a back issue of late. Top-seeded Novak Djokovic hasn't played his best tennis all year, lost in the third round in Rome and continued his search for answers by playing a lower-level tournament in Geneva before coming to Roland Garros.\n\nAnd Zverev, of course, has the Nadal thing.\n\n\"I really wanted to play him here,\" Zverev said. \"I did not want to play him in the first round.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

He'll take home just more than $79,000 for bowing out in the round of 128 of this year's tournament, but that's pocket change compared to what the Spaniard has earned at the French Open over the past two decades.\n\nIn 19 appearances at the tournament, Nadal has hoisted the Musketeers Cup a record 14 times en route to earning 21.8 million euros, or $23.7 million when converted at the current exchange rate. That accounts for roughly 18% of his career winnings of $134.7 million -- second all-time behind Novak Djokovic's $181.6 million.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nIn fact, the prize money that Nadal has won at Roland Garros alone ranks 21st on the all-time earnings list among men's tennis players across all tournaments.\n\nNadal has not officially announced that 2024 would be his last time playing the French Open, but he has repeatedly suggested in interviews that he is nearing retirement. The 37-year-old has played just 16 matches on the tour in the past 18 months while being plagued with a variety of injuries.\n\nIf this was Nadal's swan song at the place where he's enjoyed his most success, then it was one heck of a run. He is 112-4 at Roland Garros in his career, including 104-1 to all players not named Novak Djokovic prior to this year. His 14 titles are the most by any player at a single event. Nadal has won four tournaments without dropping a set and won seven finals in which he's surrendered 10 or fewer games to his opponent -- both Open Era records for all majors.\n\nAs dominant as Nadal has been on clay, he's still one of the sport's greats regardless of surface. If Nadal had never set foot at Roland Garros, he'd still be top 10 in Open Era grand slam championships and third all-time in tennis prize money.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XxnI3K.rB0qRicU0OvXIxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sportico_165/c21afb5e40b27f8fa9d3eea1f98d68e8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

It was a perfect boost to Zverev's Roland Garros ambitions and he also got revenge, having lost to Nadal in the 2022 semi-final.\n\nSpeaking in his post-match interview at courtside, the Spaniard said, \"The amount of energy.. It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's gonna be the last time here in front of all of you. I'm not sure. But if it's the last time I enjoyed it.

Maybe in 2 months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That's going to be another chance,\" he further added.\n\nThe match proved to be a star attraction, and saw Nadal's arch-rival Novak Djokovic in the crowd. Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were present at the venue.\n\nWorld No. 4 Zverev broke Nadal in the opening game, and the Spaniard surrendered his serve again late on to lose the first set. He started the second set on a positive note, and even went 4-2 ahead. But Zverev was having none of it and fought back in the 10th game, saving two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by clinching a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nIn the third set, Nadal got a 2-0 lead but once again gave it away as Zverev drew level and cemented his domination in the seventh game.

Nadal had earlier hinted that 2024 could be his final year in professional tennis. He was also given a warm send-off in the Madrid Masters, all hinting that the French Open this year could be his last. But upon arrival in Paris, he took to the press conference on Sunday to clarify that he is not yet ready to say goodbye to the most \"magical place\" in his career, thus leaving the door open for an appearance in 2025....Read More\n\nNadal had missed last year's French Open tournament in addition to most of the 2023 season owing to his recovery from a hip injury incurred during the Australian Open in January. And hence, he would be raring to make the most of his return on Roland Garros, as will his fans, but standing in his way is fourth-seeded German Zverev, fresh from his triumph at the Italian Open.\n\nThe meeting today afternoon is likely to bring back contrasting memories for both players of the last time they met on the ATP tour, in the French Open semifinal in 2022. Zverev, who lost a closely-contested opening set 6-7, was forced to retire during the second set tie-break after he had twisted his ankle. While Zverev underwent surgery later and missed the rest of the calendar year, Nadal went on to win the French Open that year. The German, however, did make a strong return in Paris last year when he made his third consecutive French Open semi-final.\n\nWith Novak Djokovic struggling with form and the likes of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz returning from their respective injuries, Zverev might fancy his chances of a maiden career Slam in French Open this year, but will have to outsmart the legendary Nadal in round one, even though the Spaniard has only looked a pale shadow of himself in his recent comeback.\n\nAfter dodging another hip injury incurred earlier this year, he returned to the clay season in Barcelona and played eight matches thereafter across three tournaments. While he incurred a round-two exit in Barcelona and Rome, he made the pre-quarters in Madrid.\n\nOthers in Day 2 action include world No. 2 Sinner, who is slated for a return to court after sitting out the Italian Open following a hip injury at the Madrid Open, and takes on American Christopher Eubanks. Meanwhile, Iga Swiatek begins her title defence against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. The Polish world number one comes to Paris after winning titles in Madrid and Rome. American third seed Coco Gauff plays 21-year-old qualifier Julia Avdeeva, with the Russian making her Grand Slam debut.\n\nFor the Indian fans, Sumit Nagal will be in action against 18th seed Karen Khachanov.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9olia_Jeanjean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9olia Jeanjean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eubanks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Eubanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumit_Nagal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sumit Nagal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Khachanov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Khachanov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/27/550x309/nadal_zverev_blog_1716795641830_1716795648218.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He says he'd like to be back on the Roland Garros clay all over again, in eight weeks, for the Paris Summer Olympics, so all these Rafa soliloquies and encomiums may be premature.\n\nWhatever the case, the 14-time champion, age 37, is out of this year's French Open -- his earliest departure ever, an occasionally tantalizing but ultimately deflating first-round exit to Alexander Zverev, 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6, before an emotional packed house at Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nIt's not the sort of finish anyone wants, for perhaps the greatest warrior tennis has ever seen.\n\nHas there ever been a tenant-landlord relationship in sports quite like Rafael Nadal and the French Open? Sports legends have been tied to stadia -- Bill Russell to Boston Garden; Lionel Messi to Camp Nou; Cal Ripken to Camden Yards, even if The Streak started at Memorial -- but those were permanent homes. Nadal settled in Paris just one fortnight per year.\n\nAnd yet this tournament became home, to the point Nadal's French became robust, because why not, he had to give a victory speech every year.\n\nBefore Monday, he was lifetime 112-3 at Roland Garros. Mull on that for a minute. The losses were as indelible as the championships -- a fourth-round stunner to Robin Soderling in 2009; defeats to Novak Djokovic in the 2015 quarterfinals and the semis in 2021. Otherwise: near perfection.\n\nNadal was seldom pushed to the limit at this tournament. He won them in cascades, dominantly, four times not dropping a single set en route.\n\nHe had a whole other tennis life, of course -- four titles at the U.S. Open; two at Wimbledon; two in Australia; a gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Nadal's twilight title on grass over Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2008 still stands as one of the greatest matches ever; his 2022 hard-court triumph in Melbourne was an old man classic, a comeback from two sets down to Daniil Medvedev.\n\nParis was his kingdom, however. When Nadal debuted there, at age 18, in 2005, with a straight-sets victory over (win yourself a Kronenbourg) Lars Burgmuller, he expressed dismay about his performance.\n\n\"My game was so full of approximations and hesitations,\" he said. He quickly grew confident over those two weeks, beating (win another Kronenbourg) Mariano Puerta in four sets on his way to hoisting Coupe des Mousquetaires No. 1.\n\nSo much for approximations and hesitations.\n\nHe won 13 more. Phew. Nadal winning the French became as predictable as the April rain. He beat Federer four times, Djokovic three times, Dominic Thiem twice, then Soderling, David Ferrer, Stan Wawrinka and Casper Ruud once apiece.\n\nHis finals felt more like coronations than competitions. Our late Journal colleague, Tom Perrotta, loved to tell the story of running into the coach of a French Open finalist the day before the match and asking if his pupil stood a chance against Nadal.\n\nNo, no, no, the coach said dismissively, walking away.\n\nThere's a case that Nadal's status as an all-timer -- and his 22 majors overall, second only to Djokovic's 24 -- shrinks a little because of his trophy-hoarding at Roland Garros. I don't agree. Mostly I disagree because winning 22 majors is completely insane. I also disagree because Nadal was a tough out anywhere, as his other titles attest.\n\nNadal wasn't strictly a clay court specialist, like Guga Kuerten, and besides, clay ceased being such an outlier in recent years, as every surface was groomed to accommodate the back and forth of starry baseliners.\n\nIt is true Nadal grew up on clay, as Spaniards do, and his game was especially suited to the terre battue, those lasso topspin forehands collecting grit and fresh life on the bounce. He started parking himself halfway to Versailles to return serve, neutralizing heavy hitters.\n\nNadal could run all day at Philippe-Chatrier, a spacious den, and his endurance was comical. Many brought their best tennis against him. He'd simply wait you out.\n\nEarly on, Nadal was sold as a style -- a noisy, muscled strongman to compete against Federer's lean Swiss grace. Nike packaged him as a teen swashbuckler in sleeveless shirts and capri pants, but the look sort of missed the point, which was always his heart.\n\nNadal's career was pockmarked by injury -- he missed significant stretches of time, to the point we wondered if he would return, and he always did, triumphantly. He did that in matches, too. From the depths, he found ways to dig himself out. That's heart.\n\nYou could feel his heart against Zverev, when he won breaks in the second and third sets and briefly spun the momentum. Zverev was a brutal draw for the unseeded Nadal, but the crowd, which included Djokovic and Spanish tennis heir Carlos Alcaraz, tried to push the grand champion through. With Zverev facing an upcoming trial on domestic abuse charges (he maintains his innocence), the energy was as one-sided as it could be.\n\nCould it happen for Rafa? Yes. It briefly felt it could.\n\nDid it happen? No. It wasn't really close.\n\nThat's tennis, cruel to the end. The solace is we got more from Nadal than we should have. A player who played tennis like he did should never have played for as long as he did, all that torque and physicality and tumbling around. Instead he delivered a complete second act. He elevated from youthful tornado to wizened warrior.\n\nIn defeat, Nadal congratulated Zverev and accepted a turn at the microphone, repeating what he'd already said, that he isn't 100% sure he's through. He confirmed he wants to return for the Olympics. He said he was feeling better about his tennis, and being on tour with his family, which is the sort of stuff you say if you are having second thoughts about retirement.\n\nThis might not be the end. I don't think anyone can be certain. Not in France or anywhere. Rafael Nadal's heart will tell him.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type":

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRafael Nadal has been the only player on everyone's mind during the French Open 2024. Unfortunately, the Spaniard could not cross the line on Monday in the first round, falling short to Alexander Zverev, 3-6, 6-7 (5-7), 3-6. But, Nadal has made many tennis enthusiasts on social media nostalgic after an old photo of his ID card from the French Open 2005 has gone viral.\n\nA professional sports photographer, Antoine Couvercelle, uploaded a photo of Rafael Nadal's accreditation from the French Open 2005. Naturally, fans of the 22-time Grand Slam champion were left in awe. As soon as the photo was uploaded on Instagram, users showered the post with a lot of love.\n\nThe French Open 2005 is one of the most memorable tournaments in the ATP Tour's history. An 18-year-old Rafael Nadal participated in his first French Open. The teenager would go on to create history, lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires after dropping merely three sets throughout the competition.\n\nThe Raging Bull further dominated the tournament for the next two decades. 14 out of the Mallorca native's 22 Grand Slams came at the French Open. According to many, Nadal could've won the title in 2004 had it not been for injuries.\n\nRafael Nadal was unfortunate enough to sustain gruesome injuries in 2003 and 2004. The pain in his elbow and foot injury, respectively, prevented the youngster from participating in the French Open. However, despite not being a household name on the tour, Nadal correctly envisioned the success he'd witness at Roland Garros in the future.\n\nIn 2004, when Rafa visited the Court Philippe-Chatrier in crutches to catch the French Open, he made a bold claim to his agent at Nike.

It's the second of four grand slam events on the calendar this year, and marks the start of a jam-packed summer of grand slam tennis, with Wimbledon and the US Open also on the horizon.\n\nHowever, this year's French Open is also set to be the final bow at Roland Garros for Rafael Nadal, who is rumoured to be making his last French Open appearance. The Spaniard has 14 titles to his name -- a tournament record -- won between 2005 and 2022, including an unprecedented five on the spin from 2010-2014.\n\nAs he comes towards the end of his career, Nadal has dropped to number 276 in the world and comes into this year's French Open with a protected ranking, as he returns from injury. The draw doesn't sympathise though, and Nadal couldn't have asked for a more difficult start -- he'll face Germany's Alexander Zverev in the first round -- who is seeded fourth and one of the favourites to win the title at Roland-Garros.\n\nAs Nadal navigates what will almost certainly be his final appearance on the clay courts of Roland-Garros, you can follow his progress throughout the tournament alongside The Sporting News, with that stern test against Zverev coming up this weekend.\n\nThe first round of the 2024 French Open pits 14-time champion Nadal against fourth seed Zverev at Roland-Garros, making it arguably the must-see match-up of the opening stages at this year's tournament.\n\nNadal is scheduled to play the world No.4 in his first-round match on Sunday, May 26 at around 12:00 p.m. local time (CET).\n\nIf he can cause an upset and defeat Zverev this Sunday, Nadal will move into the second round, where he'll face either Belgium's David Goffin or French wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, who also face off on the same side of the draw.\n\nThe Sporting News will update this post when official timing details are confirmed, but here's how that expected 12:00 p.m. start translates for some of the world's major regions.\n\nAs the most successful player ever to grace the clay courts of Roland-Garros faces off against a tournament favourite, Nadal and Zverev's first-round match will be one of the most anticipated clashes at this stage of the 2024 French Open, and as such there's plenty of coverage confirmed.\n\nHere's a look at the following TV channels and live streams showing the French Open in the major territories:\n\nIf the 2024 French Open is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs offer a secure and private online connection, allowing you to bypass geographical restrictions to access your favourite streaming services from any device anywhere in the world.\n\nWATCH FROM ANYWHERE: Sign up for NordVPN (30-day moneyback guarantee)\n\nNadal is by far and away the most successful player in French Open history, collecting a record 14 titles over an 18-year period and being absolutely unbeatable for large stretches of that time between 2005 and 2022.\n\nOf his 14 tournament wins, only one -- the most recent in 2022 -- has been a stand-alone victory, with Nadal often preferring to win four or five tournaments in a row! His maiden victory in 2005 began a four-year streak until 2008, and he went one better between 2010 and 2014, winning five in a row at Roland-Garros.\n\nHis most recent multi-year run saw the Spaniard collect another four consecutive titles between 2017 and 2020, and the 37-year-old has never been beaten in a final either: losing in the 2015 quarterfinals and 2020 semis -- both to Novak Djokovic. A storied career on the clay looks set to be coming to an end this year, but it's been one hell of a ride for the enigmatic Nadal.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Mpetshi_Perricard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Goffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/Rafael%20Nadal%202024_4.jpg?itok=Y9X1BDq5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 1648, "textEnd": 1654}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

And why is he unseeded?", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend.

But now, maybe not. \"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal said after his first round loss to Alexander Zverev. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because my wife and child are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see. I need to give myself a little bit longer to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\" Exactly who do you think you are? One of the greatest players of all time?\n\nDefinitely gone\n\nRafael Nadal lost in the first round for the first time since he started coming to the French Open in 2005. Even he said it's unusual for him not to be the favourite to win his first round match. But that's what happens when you slip down to number 276 in the world and you face the fourth seed at a tournament soon after he has claimed the Italian Open. Nadal was valiant in defeat and munificent. \"Well played,\" he told Zverev during the on-court interviews. \"Congratulations on your win in Rome and all the best for the rest of this tournament.\"\n\nRead more on RFI English\n\nRead also:\n\nRoland Garros: Five things we learned on Day 1: Old stagers give it a go\n\nNadal, Djokovic and Murray hail retiring Laver Cup teammate Federer\n\nAlcaraz shrugs off stings and swarm of bees to dispatch Zverev at Indian Wells", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/rfi_english_75/b6f54524374e1c618dd25cc0503b5523", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Nadal had expressed to the event's officials last week his desire to avoid a retirement celebration, insisting he wasn't ready to \"close the door\" on returning to the Parisian grand slam.\n\nHowever, it appeared that his wishes were overlooked. The stands behind the players' area were packed with tennis luminaries such as Carlos Alcaraz tipped to be Nadal's successor his long-standing adversary Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek, the women's world number one and three-time winner.\n\nAmong the audience were also Nadal's spouse Xisca, who seldom attends his matches, their infant son Rafael Jr, and his uncles Toni Nadal's ex-coach and Miguel Angel, the former Spanish footballer. Rodri, the Manchester City midfielder accustomed to winning himself, was another notable figure taking in the match.\n\nThe audience were privileged enough to witness sparks of Nadal's former magnificence during the match his rapid-fire volley exchange in the opening set; a surprising drop shot from significantly behind the baseline in the second; and a blistering forehand winner that sealed a break at the outset of the third. Despite this, a sluggish start meant that Nadal fumbled a break in the initial game, a misstep which he failed to recover from. Furthermore, Zverev had an iron grip in the tie-breaker, upping his game for the decisive final moment.\n\nTherefore, Nadal's astounding Roland Garros tally now stands as 112 victories from 116 matches, with Zverev joining the ranks of Djokovic and Robin Soderling - the only other players to ever defeat Nadal at the venue. It was a consequential triumph for the German player, who is currently weighed down by an impending trial concerning allegations of domestic abuse accusations he has denied scheduled to commence shortly.\n\nTwo years prior on this very same court, Zverev had a painful encounter with Nadal in the semi-finals where a slip incapacitated his leg resulting in nearly a year on the sidelines. His post-match festivities were quite subdued after Nadal missed a crucial forehand, allowing the crowd at Chatrier to rise in appreciation, possibly bidding farewell to their adored hero one final time.\n\nFollowing the match, Nadal was coaxed by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo into addressing the spectators. \"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he expressed.\n\n\"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most. I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros.\"\n\n\"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\"\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics. I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here.

Jean-Francois Badias/Associated Press\n\nPARIS -- Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament.\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout.\n\nNadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat.\n\nHis three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

NBC and streaming service Peacock begin their Monday coverage of the French Open at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nEuropean viewers can catch the action on Eurosport, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nA tough path to 15\n\nNadal has won Roland Garros 14 times - the most of any player by a comfortable margin - and possesses an incredible 112-3 record at the tournament.\n\n\"You win it five times, that's a lot,\" tennis great Boris Becker recently told CNN Sport. \"You win it 10 times, it's impossible. Nadal's won it 14 times. I don't know any other record in any other sport that equals that.\"\n\nCurrently blocking his path towards an unthinkable 15th title though is former world No. 2 Zverev, widely tipped as one of the favorites to win the tournament in Paris.\n\nThe German is a proficient clay court player and is fresh off winning his sixth Masters 1000 title in Rome earlier this month. He has struggled against Nadal in the past, however, holding a 3-7 record against the legendary Spaniard. The last meeting between the pair came in the French Open semifinals in 2022, where Zverev suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him for the rest of the year.\n\nThough speculation remains rampant that this could be the last time Nadal appears at Roland Garros as an active player, the 22-time grand slam singles champion told the media that he was not willing to close the door on competing in 2025.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not because I cannot predict what's going on - I hope you understand,\" he said ahead of the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_joseph@cnn.com", "name": "Samuel Joseph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nOn a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nAs soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6 6-4 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from a early break down in the third set where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3 only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\nReporting by Julien Pretot; Additional reporting by Frank Pingue; Editing by Christian

But... because he doesn't know whether it will be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open to maybe come back as a player next year. So obviously we're not going to force him to do anything, Mauresmo said.\n\nIt's his decision if he wants to have a good ceremony, a good farewell, a good farewell. So we wouldn't do it this year. That is his wish, she continued. And even though we were prepared to push the button if something happens, we will obviously respect what he wants and make sure we are ready when he thinks he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; whenever he wants.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has previously said he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled for third place at the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start around 3:30 PM local time (9:30 AM EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nDespite the fact that such a dominant record at the French OpenNadal was unseeded, so he could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and continued to play against anyone, even the very best opponents. Due to injuries including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscles, Nadal has not fought much over the past two seasons, going just 7-4 in 2024, making him someone who is ranked No. 1 and has spent more than a decade at the top. 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first unseeded Grand Slam tournament since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, taking into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have chosen to bypass the rules and award a seeding to Nadal based on his previous performance in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, partly because offering protection to some players would lead to many other problems, and because other Grand Slams and such have to be okay too.\n\nSeeded players like Zverev are guaranteed to avoid facing another seeded player earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which has a 128-player field and requires seven wins to earn a championship .\n\nPlayers mostly agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain as it is now (Wimbledon used to place players on grass courts based on their results, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). I think the way sowing works is appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you can judge where someone should and shouldn't be placed based on past or previous success, said three-time champion Andy Murray. It would be quite difficult to do that.\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who has won a clay-court title at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and reached second place at the 2020 US Open. He reached the semi-finals at the French Open in each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage, but was forced to retire after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to be confronted legal proceedings starting next week in Berlin related to allegations of physical abuse against an ex-girlfriend. He is not required to appear in court and said he won't. Ultimately, I do believe in the German system. I also believe in the truth. I have to make sure that, you know, I know what I did, I know what I didn't do, Zverev said. That's what will come out in the end, and I have to trust that.\n\nMauresmo was asked on Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: As long as the trial is not completed and there is no decision, he is considered innocent and therefore allowed to participate in the draw.\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the APs tennis writer since 2002.

It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a pro, I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court.\"\n\n\"Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment,\" Zverev added.\n\nNadal, ranked 275 at the moment, had never played Roland-Garros unseeded, and never faced a top-10 player in the first round. He had also never lost consecutive matches on his beloved clay, but Zverev changed all that with a command performance.\n\n\"It's true that the first round has not been an ideal one,\" Nadal said after the match. \"I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha.\"\n\nAs soon as the draw was made, the talk of the red dirt major was this highly-anticipated showdown since the Spaniard legend has indicated on multiple occasions that this year is likely to be his last season competing on the professional tennis circuit.\n\nZverev's aggressive play set the tone in the first set. The two-time ATP Finals champion took the action to his opponent, hitting 15 winners compared to five for Nadal in the opener.\n\nNadal faced two break points early in the second set to fall into a deep deficit despite that chants of \"Rafa! Rafa!\" were heard in and outside the stadium. After digging out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break and lead by 3-2.\n\nBut his rival responded quickly with another break before claiming a tense tiebreak to take a two-set lead.\n\nAfter Nadal missed a final shot on match point, Zverev gave a muted celebration out of respect for the 22-time major champion. They enjoyed a warm greeting at the net.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable,\" Nadal said. \"I never dreamed I would be here at almost 38 years old, with all the success I had here, winning so many times - it is something that I never dreamt of.\n\n\"For me, it's difficult to say what will happen in the future. It's a big percentage that I won't be back at Roland-Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. I enjoy playing here, I like travelling with the family, and my body is feeling a little bit better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nFor now, Nadal will look to continue testing himself against the best players in the world, with plans to be back in Paris for the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWorld No.1 Swiatek opened her title defence with a trademark performance, thriving as the frontrunner to dispatch local underdog Jeanjean in just one hour.\n\nThe Polish arrived at Roland-Garros on a 12-match winning streak off the back of collecting WTA 1000 titles in Madrid and Rome.\n\n\"It feels like home here,\" the three-time champion said. \"For sure, these last tournaments gave me a lot. I managed to play good tennis in any conditions, in any circumstances, I'm really proud of myself, I don't want to take anything for granted. Every tournament is a different story, a different chapter and I'll be just focused on the next match.\"\n\nReigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner also clinched a straight-set victory as the Italian beat American Christopher Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to progress.\n\nHome favourite Varvara Gracheva produced the biggest upset of the first round so far as the world No.88 came from a set down to defeat No.6 seed Maria Sakkari 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nSakkari is the first Top 10 seed to fall through the first two days of the tournament. Reigning Wimbledon champion and No.5 seed Marketa Vondrousova dropped just four games in her opening victory over Rebeka Masarova, winning 6-1, 6-3 to advance.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn",

You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nIt will only be the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nAddressing the crowd after the match, he said: \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know. There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100 percent sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nNadal will be eyeing his third Olympic gold medal after winning in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.\n\nHe had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what was likely his final French Open.\n\n\"Today I felt I was able to move better than in previous tournaments.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe voice of Roland Garros, Marc Maury, is preparing for his big moment for what could be the final time. As the master of ceremonies on Court Philippe-Chatrier, the largest of the show courts at the French Open, part of Maury's duties during the tournament is introducing the players as they make their way out on court. Most of the time, this is a straightforward assignment; many of the names slip by over the chatter of the afternoon crowds.\n\nBut when it comes to Rafael Nadal, Maury's role is transformed into a performance; a goosebumps moment as his announcement builds to a powerful crescendo. As for all former winners, Maury does not just announce the number of French Open titles they have won, but enumerates the years as well. Maury's voice is deep as it begins to rumble: \"Champion de Roland Garros en deux mille cinq, deux mille six, deux mille sept, deux mille huit...\"\n\nAnd on and on, until the voice of Roland Garros reaches Nadal's 14th and last title in Paris, \"deux mille vingt-deux\". Most players are introduced to Philippe-Chatrier within half a minute but by the time Nadal's roll-call is complete, Maury can take more than 90 seconds, all of which add to the Spaniard's legend. His historic resume of titles, and the manner in which they were won, is what made the boy from Mallorca and the French capital such a special combination.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, there may be a particular edge to Maury's voice as it begins to reverberate around Court Philippe-Chatrier, the sound of Nadal's unprecedented dominance at the French Open carrying that extra weight. This was the day that was signalled as the most significant stop on Nadal's farewell tour when he said late last year that this season was probably going to be his last. And yet, it may not be. Nadal has long possessed the ability and strength of character to endure and he revealed: \"I don't want to close, 100 per cent, the door.\"\n\nThough, at the same time, the door could close at any moment, should the pain from a difficult injury layoff return. \"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" Nadal said. He is set to return to Paris later this summer, if he decides to compete at the Olympics. Either way, it was the French Open and Roland Garros that stood as the tournament of Nadal's career, the record 14 titles defining his greatness on clay.\n\nAnd yet, Nadal will require every ounce of his indomitable aura when he faces the fourth seed Alexander Zverev in the opening round. It is a truly unbelievable draw and there were audible gasps during the ceremony when Nadal's name was pulled out of the hat next to Zverev's: it is staggeringly early in a grand slam for such a heavyweight contest, to add to what was an important day for the Spaniard anyway.\n\nZverev is arguably the favourite for the fortnight given the uncertainty around the other top seeds: defending champion Novak Djokovic has not won a title this season and is openly admitting to being \"worried\" about his form, while Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have had their preparations disrupted by injury. Zverev, meanwhile, won the title in Rome and has a good record at Roland Garros with three appearances in semi-finals.\n\nThat perhaps his most significant came against Nadal adds another layer to the blockbuster. Zverev was in a position to become only the third man in French Open history to beat Nadal at the French Open after splitting two gruelling sets in the 2022 semi-final, only to break his ankle in a freak injury that saw the German leave the court on crutches. The 27-year-old has spent much of the two years since rebuilding his form and confidence, as well as facing allegations of domestic abuse from a former girlfriend. Zverev was served a fixed penalty order from a Berlin court last November and his trial is set to begin during the French Open. Zverev denies the allegations and does not have to attend the trial in person.\n\nZverev insists the looming trial date is not on his mind and points to his Italian Open title as evidence of that. \"Of course on paper, it's not the best draw,\" Nadal said, while Zverev talked up the historical challenge he is about to face. \"In my mind, I'm going to play peak Nadal,\" Zverev said. \"That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time on this court.\"\n\nThat hasn't been the case, so far, in Nadal's latest comeback. It has not been easy at times, and after a year on the sidelines in 2023 and with his return delayed in January, age has appeared to have caught up with a great champion. There has been the usual determination and intensity but Nadal is visibly slower and is being hit through from the baseline. There were the one-sided defeats to Alex De Minaur in Barcelona and Hubert Hurkacz in Rome - good players, both, but the sort of top-10 opponents Nadal would have swept aside with barely a glance in years gone by.\n\nIn some ways, it reflects back to Nadal's last triumph in Paris 2022, when he defied his foot injury by putting it to sleep before each match. That title, which featured a classic win over Djokovic in the quarter-finals, was unexpected, even with Nadal's history. The sense that each match could have been his last added to his humility after beating Casper Ruud to win his 22nd grand slam. Two years later, Nadal is bidding to defy time once again. The aura remains, the records too, and when Nadal is introduced onto court, Roland Garros will shake as if it is the last time.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/00/GettyImages-2154582642.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

And why is he unseeded? - WTOP News", "body": "PARIS (AP) -- The French tennis federation put off holding a ceremony to celebrate Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros this year, because he has said this might not necessarily be his final appearance at the tournament he has won a record 14 times.\n\nTournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo said Sunday, Day 1 of the clay-court Grand Slam event, that Nadal let officials know he didn't want to close the door on a return before he told the world that at a pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\"As you can imagine, we had something planned for him. But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it. Later this year; next year; anytime he wants.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday.\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

I think if that's the last time that I'm gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it's normal,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.\n\n\"I mean, these kind of rivals or young players that are here like Carlos that probably watch me on TV the most of his years that they are living (smiling), it's normal that in some way they are interested to see how this is going to be, and especially in this particular place with all the history that I had behind, no?\n\n\"But yeah, I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy for my career, no? And that's it.\"\n\nNadal went on to reveal he is unlikely to play at Wimbledon, as he looks ahead to a potential final summer in tennis that could include an appearance at the Olympic Games.\n\n\"I mean, not bad feelings. I showed myself that I was ready for more than what I did at the end, that is, losing in the first round,\" added Nadal.\n\n\"That's how it is, no? When you are not seeded, you play against a player who is in great shape and is one of the best players of the world.\n\n\"As I said before, it was a positive week for me in practice in all ways. In terms of physical performance, too. Without a doubt I felt much better than before. I didn't feel those limitations. Today in the match the same. I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments.\n\n\"I had a very tough opponent in front. And he played well, I think. Even like this, I had my chances, you know, with serving for the set in the second, then against another 15-40. In the third again a break up and then another 15-40 and 5-3 in the second to 15-30. I mean, I was not that far. That's my feeling. That's probably true.\n\n\"At the end, I was ready to build my game and my confidence day by day. But I didn't have days of competition, because I faced a very tough opponent in front. Probably today I needed him not playing a great match.\n\n\"I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. Of course disappointed for losing, but in terms of body feelings, happy that I finish healthy, you know, and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\n\n\"So that's it. Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.\n\n\"I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I lost, but that's part of the business.\"", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_palmer@tennis365.com", "name": "Kevin Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F27210053%2F2X8W6C9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of skyblue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Rafael Nadal Tennis Racket Sports Tennis Tournaments Sports Tennis Players Grand Slam (tennis) Clay Court

Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters\n\nRafael Nadal likened his struggles with injury in the last 18 months to being in a jungle as the 14-times French Open champion hoped to return to Roland Garros for the Olympic Games after making a premature exit from the Grand Slam on Monday.\n\nNever far from physical issues in his glittering career, the 37-year-old missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major.\n\nNadal crashed to a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev in Paris and although there were positives, he said he could not predict how his battered body would respond to the demands of the Games in July and August.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nIMAGE: Rafael Nadal had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what is likely his final French Open. Photograph: Stephanie Lecocq/Reuters\n\nNadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.\n\nHe had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what is likely his final French Open.\n\n\"Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,\" Nadal added.\n\n\"I had my chances... I mean, I wasn't that far. That's my feeling. That's probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that.\"\n\n\"Of course disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I'm happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\"\n\nNadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\"\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/sports/2024/may/27rafa-quotes.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Like many enthusiasts, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek also made sure to witness Nadal play in his potentially final match at Roland Garros... even if it means that they have to sacrifice crucial rest of their own.\n\nIga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz are two young players in the tennis world who grew up idolizing Rafael Nadal. After finishing off their first-round battles, both these prodigies made it to the stands to showcase their support to the King of Clay.\n\nIt was also pleasantly surprising to witness Novak Djokovic present in the arena. Of course, the Serb shares a mutual respect for his long-time rival. But considering that Djokovic has his first-round clash on Tuesday, it is heartwarming to see him dedicate his resting time to support Nadal.\n\nWhile the stadium erupted \"Vamos Rafa\" chants, Zverev became a party spoiler and handed Rafa his first-ever opening-round loss at Roland Garros.\n\nApart from eliminating Rafael Nadal from what could mostly be his final French Open tournament, Alexander Zverev also snapped the Spaniard's insane streak of winning his past 80 matches in the Grand Slam against all players except Novak Djokovic.\n\nAlexander Zverev won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to avenge his 2022 French Open semi-final loss to Rafael Nadal, which also makes the victory more significant.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander_Technique", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Alexander Technique", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/08/8509b57e-untitled-design-33.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This year's event was expected to be the 14-time champion's farewell to Roland Garros, but he has since insisted he could not confirm \"100 percent\" it would be his last appearance.\n\nNadal has only played four tournaments since January 2023 after suffering a hip injury and then a muscle tear. That left him unseeded for the draw and vulnerable to a difficult opening round at a tournament where he has only lost three of his 115 matches.\n\nWorld number four Zverev arrives in Paris as one of the favourites for the title after winning the Rome Open earlier this month. \"Of course on paper it is not the best draw,\" Nadal said ahead of the match on Court Philippe Chatrier. \"I play against one of the toughest opponents possible, and at the same time, he came here winning the last event and it's a Masters 1000. \"It's not a small one. So what can I do? That's the draw.\n\nJust try to be ready for it.\" Nadal, who turns 38 in a week's time, has shown flashes of his best form in the claycourt swing, but was thrashed 6-1, 6-3 by Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of his last outing in Rome.\n\nHe boasts a 7-3 winning record over Zverev ahead of their first meeting since the 2022 French Open semi-finals, when the German left the court in a wheelchair near the end of the second set after injuring his ankle. \"I am not anxious. No, I am focused on trying to play well. That's it,\" said Nadal. \"Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that. \"But in my mind, is do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitively.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsofbahrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DT News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.newsofbahrain.com/admin/post/upload/A_CQco8Jj7EU_2024-05-27_1716800478resized_pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He'd fall to the stage, exhausted and despondent. The audience would keen with concern.\n\nThat was Ray's cue to hurry over and lay the cape over Brown's shoulders. He'd slowly usher his boss to the wings. Before they could get there, Brown would tear himself away, re-energized.\n\nBut Brown didn't always play it the same way. Sometimes he'd jump to his feet before Ray got to him. Sometimes he'd refuse the cape altogether. It was the not knowing that prevented the cape routine from turning into kitsch.\n\nWhatever Rafael Nadal is doing right now, it would be better with a Danny Ray.\n\nLast year, Nadal was muddily clear that 2024 would be his final season of top-level tennis.\n\n\"[It's] probably going to be my last year on the professional tour,\" he said in a prepared video.\n\nIf it's not, then why release a video?\n\nWhen you're at Nadal's level - a human corporation - these announcements are not tossed off. There are businesses to wind down, and others to wind up. Goodbye, performance footwear; Hello, whatever recent retirees are driving these days.\n\nThe Apollo Theatre of Nadal's farewell tour would be the French Open. No individual athlete has ever owned an event the way Nadal has owned this one - 18 appearances, 14 titles.\n\nAs promised, Nadal took the rest of 2023 off. Then he took the first bit of 2024 off as well. French Open officials decided that if there was going to be a farewell party, they'd better schedule it right at the beginning.\n\nWhen he got to Paris, Nadal told everyone to return the gold watch to the jewellers. He wasn't retiring after all. Well, probably not. Maybe. He was going to see.\n\nIf this was a Netflix film, the scene where Nadal walks into the dressing room, spots a novelty cake, twirls his finger in the air and says, \"We won't be needing this, caballeros,\" would happen about an hour in. That movie can still work, but it's going to need extensive re-writes.\n\nNadal played Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. Zverev, a robotic Russo-German, is an ideal tennis villain. Here's a guy the crowd doesn't feel bad about snubbing.\n\nUnfortunately, Zverev is about a hundred years younger than Nadal. He's also twice as big and, like everyone else in the men's game, no longer afraid of the Spaniard, even on clay.\n\nNadal played as well on Monday as he has in a long time. There was a run in the middle of the second set when the young Nadal reappeared - leaping four feet in the air after saving a series of break points.\n\nBut 2010 Nadal didn't last long. Mostly, it was 2024 Nadal - a step too slow and consistently off the beat.\n\nIt only seemed close because Zverev bled Nadal for three hours. By the end, the crowd was hangdog. Their Cinderella lost in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6, 6-3.\n\nOnly one other person had ever done that to Nadal in Paris - an absolute-peak-of-his-powers Novak Djokovic, nearly a decade ago. Zverev is no Djokovic.\n\nTraditionally, the loser does not address the crowd. French Open director Amelie Mauresmo had to convince Nadal to take the microphone. Once he had it, he attempted the most ambitious James Brown anyone's seen since the Godfather of Soul left us.\n\nSpeaking haltingly, but never overcome with emotion, Nadal teased the crowd with his appreciation.\n\n\"For me it's difficult to say what's going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here in Roland Garros, but I cannot say a hundred per cent.\"\n\nThe cape was on.\n\nA couple of sentences later, he said he hoped to compete in the Paris Olympics, which would mean playing at Roland Garros.\n\nThe cape was off.\n\nLater still - \"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I will be here with almost 28 ... (embarrassed pause) ... 38 years old. I would love 28!\"\n\nThe cape was back on.\n\nNadal bounced all over the place. Confused as to what exactly they were watching - an adieu or an au revoir - the crowd hung expectantly. When it became clear he was wrapping up, they began an ovation.\n\nSome may not have caught his final words: \"I really hope to see you again, but I don't know.\"\n\nShort of falling to his knees, you're not going to see a better James Brown in sport. The thing is - Brown knew the concert eventually had to end.\n\nNone of this is confusing. Encouraged by their sponsors, top athletes are being turned into nostalgia acts long past the point of competitiveness.\n\nBut it's still sad. Nadal proved on Monday that he is no longer up for it against the best. And this was on clay. What's he going to look like on hardcourt or, God help him, grass?\n\nNadal can be a semi-decent player for years to come, but why would he want that? It can't be money. Is it hubris? Or habit?\n\nNobody wants to see to see Rocky Marciano losing a two-to-one decision, no matter how much they love him. The aura of impregnability is the mystique. Once one is gone, so's the other.\n\nNadal lost his mystique on Monday. Last year, he could still kid himself that he was a legend on parade. That's gone.\n\nNow he's Muhammad Ali after he lost to Larry Holmes. He's a guy who used to be great, can't take a hint and because of that is suddenly, deeply vulnerable.\n\nWhat Nadal has left now is the cape routine.

But the Spaniard, who kept reiterating the pain and struggles of his foot injury after each of his wins, defied logic to script a thunderous run to the final. Yet, he still wasn't quite the overwhelming favourite against Daniil Medvedev, who quickly established a two-set-to-love lead, leaving an inevitable loss waiting for Nadal. As he served to stay in the third set, where he was trailing as well, the win predictor showed a four per cent probability of Nadal pulling off a comeback. The script seemed ready even as the enthusiastic Rod Laver Arena, collectively rallied behind Nadal tirelessly throughout, and the legend responded to the Russian saying 'Not today'. Eventually, what Melbourne witnessed on that glorious evening was a sheer miracle.\n\nComebacks of this magnitude have defined Nadal's illustrious career. Not just from a situational point of view, which earned him the tag of 'Relentless Rafa', but also in terms of his gameplay, given that he never was the biggest hitter or most aggressive player on tour. Yet Nadal, with his iconic forehand and a second-to-none defence, found a way to not just dominate against his contemporaries over the last two decades but also win 22 Grand Slams.\n\nOn Monday, Nadal will need to cast another spell of magic on the most cherished venues in his career, when he takes on world No. 4 Alexander Zverev on Court Philippe-Chatrier in round one of the 2024 French Open tournament. Ideally, the 37-year-old would stand favourite against the German, having beaten him seven times in their 10 meetings on tour, including two in Grand Slams, where their last encounter ended in a heartbreaking moment for Zverev as he was forced to retire from the 2022 Roland Garros semis after an ankle twist during the second set tie-break. Considering Nadal's mind-bending 112-3 record on Parisian clay, he should be the outright favourite in the draw. And ideally, Nadal would never have drawn Zverev in the first round of the French Open.\n\nBut his body has seldom been kind towards him. In the last two seasons, he dodged two hip injuries - one saw him miss the entire 2023 calendar year, while the other saw him skipping the 2024 hardcourt swing - thus leaving him as an unseeded player at the Roland Garros this year. Moreover, Nadal has looked only a pale shadow of himself in his eight matches on clay this year. He suffered round-two exits in both Barcelona and Rome, but managed to script an important run to the pre-quarters in Madrid, which remained the only event that showed rare glimpses of his past magic. But the one fact evident from the 5-3 run on clay in 2024 was age, and injuries have slowed him down. And hence, it leads to the glaring question of whether he stands a chance against Zverev on Monday.\n\nZverev heads into the tournament on the back of a title-winning run in the Italian Open, where he put on a service masterclass in the final. He lost just five points behind his serve in the match against Nicolas Jarry, winning 37/39 on first serve and 7/10 behind second.\n\nNot to forget, he double-faulted just once and dished out six aces in 11 service games. But the most stellar aspect of Zverev's performance was his ability to mix serve locations to keep Jarry guessing. In fact, in the last one year, he has been one of the best servers on tour, landing the most first serves than any other top-50 player and he stands third in the list of most serves held.\n\nFor Nadal, who has been known for his immaculate return game, especially on clay, his defence has fallen significantly in the last eight matches. While he owned a stupendous record of 48 per cent return points won and breaking serve 47 per cent of times during his 2018 clay-court run, it has nosedived to 40 and 30, respectively.\n\nIn that loss against Hubert Hurkacz in Rome earlier this month, while Nadal looked more positive than ever with his approach, he struggled not just to break serve but also lacked speed behind both his first and second serve.\n\nFor Nadal to stand a chance, he not only needs to adjust his return position against Zverev, in a bid to travel less on the points, he needs to find a way to counter those big first serves with deep returns. The other factor will be controlling the rally length. In his 14 Major wins in Paris, Nadal's dominance has been dictated through mid-length rallies (5-8), but on Monday, he would need to lessen the shots in play in a bid to reduce more pressure on his body. He needs to begin controlling the point from shot one because if he can't wrestle control of the first four shots, it will be advantage Zverev.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Laver_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rod Laver Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol\u00e1s_Jarry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicol\u00e1s Jarry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/26/1600x900/TENNIS-FRENCHOPEN-PREVIEW-24_1716741400799_1716741432776.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But it tells only part of the tale of a compelling spectacle lasting 3hr 5min hours that featured stunning strokes from both men and swings of momentum fit for a thriller.\n\nIt continued after a final forehand from Nadal sailed long, inside of honing into the court like it did when he was at his peak, with the Spaniard agreeing to address his subjects from the court. He had knocked back a farewell ceremony as he is not certain this is the end.\n\nIt is a message he reiterated again, because his mind remains willing and the body that had broken down badly over the past couple of years is now starting to feel better again.\n\nAs a case in point, against most other rivals competing at Roland Garros, he probably would have prevailed, so high was his standard. As he said when reflecting at a press conference later; \"I was not far away.\"\n\n\"It is difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it is going to be the last time I am here in front of you. I am not 100 percent sure. But if it is the last time, I enjoyed it,\" he said.\n\n\"The feelings that I have had today are difficult to describe in words but it is so special to feel the love that I have received in the place that I have loved.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be back at Roland Garros. I was competitive. I had my changes. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.\"\n\nNadal has immediate goals within reach. He is determined to make it through to the Paris Olympics, with the tennis to be held at Roland Garros. That has long seemed a likely end date, provided his body remained fit enough, but he continues to improve, he remains a threat.\n\nAs a result, it is exceptionally unlikely he will feature at Wimbledon, with the switch between clay and grass and then back to clay likely to prove problematic.\n\n\"It is difficult to say what is going on in the future. I am travelling with the family and I am having fun. And the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say, 'It is enough'. But it is something that I don't feel yet. I have some goals in front of me. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I have had on this amazing court during my tennis career have been unbelievable. I could not imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 - I wish I was 28. It has been a beautiful process.\n\n\"What makes me feel so special is all the people who are at Roland Garros behind the scenes who have been helping me from my first visit here. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again. But I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nThe atmosphere during the three hour match was akin to a Davis Cup final but there was no split in support from the crowd. Everyone was willing the 14-time champion to add another famous memory to a catalogue grander than any to have played at the venue.\n\n\"Rafa. Rafa. Rafa!\"\n\nAt times the chant became a deafening roar that reverberated around Philippe Chatrier Court, the volume enhanced by the roof in place due to torrential rain at times that interrupted play on the outside courts.\n\nIt was the hottest ticket in Paris and a spectacle even the players, who rarely stray from their routine of bouncing between their hotel, the courts and the massage table during tournaments, could not miss.\n\nNovak Djokovic, who has a 30-29 advantage of over his great rival, camped not far behind the Zverev box to take in what proved to be an exceptional second set of tennis.\n\nIga Swiatek, who began her campaign for a third straight Roland Garros title in swift fashion a match earlier, was back courtside to watch her idol in action.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, too, watched with concern on his face as Nadal tried valiantly to level the match deep in the second set. French stars including Alize Cornet also dropped in to watch.\n\nRoger Federer's agent Tony Godsick was on hand as well and entered the Nadal camp prior to the match to offer his well wishes.\n\n\"I am happy that happens because that means I had a positive legacy here and a positive moment in my career,\" Nadal said.\n\nNear the entrance to the grounds fans who had braved the wintry conditions stopped to consider and also photograph the 3m steel sculpture of the Spaniard scorching a forehand.\n\nThe statue is now three years old and an honour to a living legend. So rare has Nadal's reign been, he earned a tribute to his domination while he was still winning major titles.\n\nAre those days behind him? Clearly his domination is. But Nadal showed enough to suggest that if he is fit, there might yet be another marvellous moment to savour, perhaps with a golden tinge back at Roland Garros in a couple of months time.\n\nNadal started slowly, making a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes in the opening game, including a double fault, to concede serve. But from early in the second set he began striking the backhand with more venom while getting a toehold in Zverev's service games.\n\nIf the 22-time major winner was shaky on serve early in the match, he did little to concede when broken back deep in the second. The German, simply, was too good, playing inspired tennis from 3-5, 15-30 to surge back into the set.\n\nBut there were moments where Nadal rolled back the clock. The thunderous forehand he thumped at full sprint that went whizzing by an advancing Zverev in the second set tiebreaker was one.\n\nSo, too, another that enabled him to break serve to start the third set. He was in unfamiliar territory by that stage, trailing by two sets at Roland Garros for just the second time. Later in the set he somehow returned a smash from Zverev with a forehand carrying even more venom that left the German shaking his head.\n\nHis touch at the net, too, was sublime. Every time the legend had a volley in the first two sets, he won the point, with the angles he found time and again simply exquisite.\n\nBut the rustiness was apparent and pitted against a rival he described as \"one of the best in the world\", it was a combination that caused his downfall. A drop shot on the backhand side was one example. But more to the point, he could not hit through his rival enough either.\n\nZverev is younger and stronger. He found greater angles on his serve and was able to hit winners with greater frequency.\n\nNadal was almost unbeatable in Paris, with his record now standing at 128-4. But Father Time is unbeatable. Even those who once seemed immortal eventually surrender.\n\n\"I played I think at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So (I'm) happy for that,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course (I'm) disappointed for losing, but in terms of (my) body feeling, (I'm) happy that I finish healthy ... and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more. So that's it. Accept the moment.

The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz - Nadal's heir apparent - long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nAlso in attendance were Nadal's wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni - his former coach - and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer.\n\nManchester City midfielder Rodri, no stranger to titles himself, was another famous face in the crowd.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nIt was a significant win for the German, who still has the cloud of a trial over domestic abuse allegations - which he denies - hanging over him and which begins this weekend.\n\nThe last time he faced Nadal was on the same court two years ago in the semi-finals, when he slipped and seriously injured his ankle, costing him the best part of a year of his career.\n\nHis celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero.\n\nNadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd.\n\n\"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent - but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said.\n\n\"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here. I really hope to see you again - but I don't know.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Mon 27 May 2024, 6:15 PM Last updated: Mon 27 May 2024, 6:31 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=2278c401-bd06-5771-8bb2-cddbd8af3227&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99558&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He plans to partner reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz in a potentially world-beating doubles team.\n\nAsked whether he intends to compete at Wimbledon, Nadal replied: \"Looks difficult, honestly. I need to talk with [the] team. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body [to] now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay, no?\"\n\nNadal was speaking after only his fourth loss in 19 tilts at the French Open title. His 112-4 record, which will remain the final count if he decides to retire later this summer, will go down as one of the most extraordinary achievements in sport.\n\nHe put on a real show for the fans on Court Philippe Chatrier despite suffering a 6-3, 7-6, 6-3 loss to world No 4 Alexander Zverev.\n\n\"I played, I think, at a good level in all ways, compared to the way that I was playing the weeks before,\" Nadal said. \"So, happy for that. Of course, disappointed for losing, but in terms of body feelings, happy that I finish healthy, you know, and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\n\n\"So that's it. Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself. I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and [for] the last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nIn a competitive display that lasted three hours and five minutes, Nadal showed plenty of the strokes that made him the King of Clay: the booming forehand, the delicate drop shots, and the decisive touches at the net, all complemented by his trademark \"start the lawnmower\" celebrations.\n\nHe would probably have beaten most opponents in this form, but Zverev - the fourth favourite here after winning the most recent tour event in Rome - represented a brutal first-round draw.\n\nZverev's serve has been the best in the game of late, and the showery weather also worked in his favour. With the roof closing, there was not a breath of wind to disrupt his ball toss, and he capitalised by landing a mighty 78pc of first serves.\n\nIf there was a sour note to this absorbing match, it was that Nadal should have fallen to one of the game's most divisive figures. In Berlin on Friday, a court will consider Zverev's defence against claims of domestic abuse levelled by his former girlfriend, Brenda Patea, although Zverev has not been required to attend in person.\n\nAs Zverev gave a respectful verbal tribute to Nadal at the finish of the match, a voice from the stands could be heard shouting: \"The trial, the trial!\"\n\nNadal then took the microphone. His family, especially his sister Maria Isabel, wept openly as he gave his emotional post-match speech, thanking the fans and the people behind the scenes \"from the bottom of my heart\".\n\nThe prospect that he might not return to the French Open brought a starry cast of spectators to the stands: not only Manchester City midfielder Rodri but also title contenders Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek.\n\n\"I didn't see them, but I think in some way it's normal, no?\" said Nadal after the match. \"If I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or Australia and I was there, or young players like Carlos that probably they watch me on TV most of his years, it's normal that they are interested to see.\n\n\"I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy, no?\"\n\nBut is this really Nadal's final Roland Garros? He stopped short of saying so, explaining that he would re-examine his prospects later in the summer. \"My mindset was ready till [the] Olympics, and then I need to check how I feel in different ways. I mean, in terms of personal motivation, body feelings, and then in terms of [the] level of tennis [if] it makes sense to keep playing.\"\n\nAsked if he would be able to manage the Olympic schedule, which involves playing every day without a rest day in between, he replied: \"I cannot tell you because my body has been a jungle for two years. I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger. You know, have been a big fighting with all the things that I went through, no? But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks, no?\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_briggs@independent.ie", "name": "Simon Briggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/t9_2GWhPtOFYwXwBHzy8BeqrLO4=/0x115:2297x1649/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/3d6878f6-d810-49ce-b2b8-82e8de3d4f70/36dbd5ce-ee11-4230-924f-1e7ba6a7431c/3d6878f6-d810-49ce-b2b8-82e8de3d4f70.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I hope you understand,\" he was quoted as saying by Reuters. \"I don't want to close 100% the door... Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going'. But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one.\"\n\nNadal, the 14-time champion who has always played this tournament as a top-five seed, was left to the mercy of the draw as an unseeded player this time around and was dealt a brutal first-round assignment against fourth seed and recent Italian Open champion Alexander Zverev, which takes place on Monday.\n\nUpbeat and playing \"without limitation\" for the first time in a year and a half, Nadal was not quick to complain about his upcoming opponent either. \"I'm enjoying what I'm doing again. Sorry, but I am feeling competitive in practices. Maybe not yet in matches, but in the practices, I am able to play almost against anyone. It's giving me some hope,\" he said.\n\nScraps of hope is what Nadal must live on to be competitive after just 15 professional matches since the start of 2023 and a ranking of World No.275 as he has nursed adnominal and hip injuries.\n\nA month ago, Nadal arrived in Madrid struggling for fitness and rhythm, claiming he will not be able to play the French Open in the form and shape he was in at the time. That week, though, he was able to stitch together a few wins and leave with a positive mindset. Even though he ran into reality in Rome a week later, suffering a dire loss to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round, the rhythm seems to have returned, and an unusually confident persona has emerged.\n\nEven then it will be a tall order for him to take on the in-form Zverev, who may be mounting a title challenge himself -- even while his domestic abuse trial kicks off in Berlin during this tournament.\n\nIn terms of matchups, this is not a favourable one for Nadal either. Zverev's tall frame, power, and solid backhand nullify, to an extent, the Spaniard's greatest strength - his high-bouncing, topspin-laden lefty forehand which he uses to target a right-handed opponent's backhand. Given his recent injuries, Nadal has not been able to find much purchase on his serve either, which will not allow him to squeeze his way out of trouble under pressure.\n\nEffective returner\n\nYet, Nadal's body of work on this ground makes it impossible to see this encounter as a foregone conclusion. If the Spaniard can construct points using his heavy forehand, and unleash it down the line with depth and accuracy, Zverev may find it difficult to cope. Nadal is also an effective returner, and while Zverev has a huge first serve, he has a notoriously poor record on his second serve.\n\nThe German has also, over the years, shown a capacity to collapse - having lost a Major final from two sets and a break up, and as recently as this year's Australian Open, lost a semifinal from the same position. Miniscule chances may open up for Nadal to take control if the pressure of a hugely partisan crowd gets to Zverev and he begins to blink.\n\nThis match - a realistic title contender taking on a 14-time champion in the first round - remains a rarity and is likely to be a blockbuster showdown for its larger significance. Despite all the narrative-rich subtext, Nadal will have to search for the kind of form and fight that he has not found in the last two years. The last time he did, after a fortnight of applying pain-numbing injections to address a chronic foot issue, he limped out of this very arena with the trophy. Expect him to believe, even if that may not be enough.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "namit_kumar@indianexpress.com", "name": "Namit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serve_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serve (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Nadal-Zverev.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

A week on Monday, he will celebrate his 38th birthday.\n\nA former world number one, who is now at 276 in the world, Nadal has only played 15 matches since January last year as a hip injury and then a muscle tear were added to a depressing litany of physical ailments which have forced him to miss 12 Grand Slam tournaments in his career. Unseeded this year, his farewell to arms may be brief after he was drawn to face world number four Alexander Zverev in the first round with the match set for Monday.\n\n\"I'm going to play the tournament thinking that I can give my all, 100 percent,\" explained Nadal after a second-round exit in Rome. \"And if 100 percent is not enough to win a match, I'll accept that. But I don't want to step onto court knowing that I have no chance. If there's a 0.01 percent chance, I want to explore that and give it a go.\"\n\nAs well as 14 titles in Paris, Nadal can boast a record of 112 wins and just three losses, two of which came against career-long rival Novak Djokovic. He is also held in remarkably high esteem.\n\nAt his first training session on Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros on Monday an estimated 6,000 people turned up to watch, many chanting his name. Fellow Grand Slam winners Stan Wawrinka and Daniil Medvedev practised with Nadal this week.\n\nWawrinka said Nadal was as \"strong as ever\" while Medvedev admitted he was \"happy not to be facing\" the Spanish star. Zverev has only beaten Nadal once in six clay-court meetings. When they met in Paris in 2022, the German was forced to retire from their semi-final after sustaining a serious ankle injury. \"In my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. That's what I expect him to be. I expect him to be at his absolute best,\" said Zverev, who arrives in Paris having won the prestigious Rome Open title.\n\nDjokovic under cloud: Nadal isn't the only A-list talent under a Paris cloud ahead of the tournament start on Sunday.\n\nDefending champion and record 24-time Grand Slam title winner Djokovic, whose three titles in Paris put him alongside Gustavo Kuerten, Mats Wilander and Ivan Lendl, is enduring a title dry spell unseen since 2018.\n\nBack then, he also reached May without a trophy before crashing to a shock quarter-final defeat at the French Open to unheralded Marco Cecchinato of Italy.\n\nThis season, Djokovic has lost his Australian Open title and has yet to make a final.\n\nAdding injury to insult, he was hit on the head by a falling water bottle in Rome, a freak accident which he claimed caused nausea and dizziness.\n\nIn an attempt to gather a degree of clay-court confidence, Djokovic, who turned 37 on Wednesday, grabbed a late wild card in the ongoing Geneva tournament.", "source": {"uri": "dailytimes.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sajid_salamat@dailytimes.com.pk", "name": "Sajid Salamat", "type":

The seats behind the players' boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz -- Nadal's heir apparent -- long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women's number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek.\n\nThey were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third.\n\nBut a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight.\n\nSo Nadal's astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here.\n\nIt was a significant win for the German, who still has the cloud of a trial over domestic abuse allegations -- which he denies -- hanging over him and which begins this weekend.\n\nThe last time he faced Nadal was on the same court two years ago in the semi-finals, when he slipped and seriously injured his ankle, costing him the best part of a year of his career.\n\nHis celebrations were low key as Nadal sent a forehand wide on match point, before Chatrier rose, possibly for one last time, to salute their hero.\n\nNadal was persuaded afterwards by tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to say a few words to the crowd.\n\n\"I don't know if it's gonna be my last time here in front of you, not 100 per cent -- but if it is I enjoyed it,\" he said.\n\n\"The feelings that I have are difficult to describe, it's so special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries and I went through a process with the dream of being back at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The first round was not the dream one but I was competitive and had my chances. It's difficult to say what's going on in the future, a big percentage that I won't be back but I can say 100 per cent I am enjoying playing and having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I'll say it's enough, but it's something I don't want yet and I want to be back on this court for the Olympics.\n\n\"I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 with all the success I had here.

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports\n\nVery seldom does one see a packed house at the Philippe Chatrier when a practice match occurs. However, if one of those players is Rafael Nadal, it's a different story. Recently, as the 14-time Roland Garros winner was playing a warm-up game against Danish star Holger Rune, he won a point after quite a rally and that made the crowd go berserk.\n\nAfter driving a record crowd in Rome at the Italian Open 2024, Rafael Nadal is surely the biggest attraction at this year's French Open. Fans realize that the biggest star this tournament has ever seen could be playing his last tournament here. Therefore, to ensure he performs well, Rafael Nadal has been playing practice matches with some big players.\n\nBefore Rune, he has already played with Daniil Medvedev and Stan Wawrinka. The Spaniard won both of those encounters.\n\nAs for the point he scored against Holger Rune, it started with an innocuous serve from the Dane. As Nadal hit it back, a rally formed in no time. After a while, Rune hit a volley, for which Nadal was ready. He perfectly hit it back, but Rune collected it, only to hit another volley. This time, Nadal hit the ball back with a greater pace and Rune missed it.\n\nThe crowd rose in unison with an echo that reverberated throughout the stadium. It was Kids Day at the Philippe Chatrier Court, and nothing made the young French crowd happier than seeing Rafael Nadal win.\n\nNadal won his practice match against Rune. It was especially imperative for him since he has a tough draw at this year's French Open.\n\nRafael Nadal's win against Rune, Medvedev, and Wawrinka will put him in a good headspace before starting his campaign against Alexander Zverev. Zverev, who is the 4th seed in the tournament, is not known for being a pushover. Given that this will be the first Grand Slam Nadal will play as an unseeded player since the 2005 Australian Open, his opponents will be tough right from the beginning.\n\nMedvedev, who lost his practice match against Nadal, believes that the Spaniard is playing better tennis here than in the Italian Open and Madrid Open.\n\nTherefore, he is glad to not face him in his draw. He feels it will be tough for Zverev to get past his first-round hurdle. Despite coming off an injury, Rafael Nadal is never easy to beat at Roland Garros.\n\nThe Zverev vs Nadal match is scheduled to start at 8:30 am Eastern Time and 12:30 pm GMT on Monday. The match will stream live on the Tennis Channel, NBC, and Peacock in the US. In the UK and other parts of Europe, it will stream on the Eurosport app and Discovery+ channel.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanmay_roy@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Tanmay Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discovery+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/08/bb4e06f2-untitled-design-41.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

By ATP Staff\n\nRafael Nadal soaked in the moment after what may have been his final match at Roland Garros, the tournament that has become a second home for the Spaniard. After putting in a strong performance in a tight, three-set defeat to Alexander Zverev, Nadal took the opportunity to address to Court Philippe-Chatrier crowd on Monday.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I am going to be here in front of you, honestly,\" he said. \"I am not 100 per cent sure, but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd has been amazing during the whole week of preparation and today. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words but for me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt, in the place that I love the most.\"\n\nAfter offering his congratulations to Zverev -- two years after their most recent Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting ended in disaster for the German, who suffered a gruesome ankle injury -- Nadal expressed just how much this potential return to Roland Garros fuelled him during his injury struggles.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through all this process with the dream to be back here in Roland Garros,\" he said. \"It's true that the first round hasn't been the ideal one. I needed something else. I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha.\"\n\nIn his post-match press conference, Nadal shed more light on his recovery process and the constant challenges he faced while he was out of action.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years,\" he said. \"You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger (smiling). It has been a big fight with all the things that I went through, But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks.\"\n\nWhile Nadal acknowledged that this was likely his final match at Roland Garros, he reiterated his comments from before the tournament that he would not rule out a return in 2025 -- a sentiment that drew big applause from the French fans.\n\n\"For me it's difficult to say what's going on in the future,\" Nadal explained on court. \"Probably it's a big percentage that I will not be back here playing at Roland Garros, but I can't say 100 per cent. I enjoy a lot playing here, I am traveling with the family and I am having fun. The body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago.\"\n\nWhether or not he returns to Roland Garros, he confirmed his plans to be back on Court Philippe Chatrier for the Paris Olympics, where he will bid for his second gold medal in singles (and possibly a second gold in doubles, as well).\n\n\"I have some goals in front [of me],\" he continued. \"I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That's going to be another chance and I really hope to be well prepared.\n\n\"The amount of feelings that I had on this amazing court during all my tennis career is just unbelievable. I never could imagine when I was a kid that I would be here, almost 38 years old, with all the success that I had here, winning so many times, something that I never could dream about.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/27/17/19/nadal-roland-garros-2024-speech-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

their semifinal match in a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal-Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1, 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from an early break down in the third set, where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3, only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"},

The 14-time champion will compete in Paris with a protected ranking. He has played only six tournaments since the beginning of 2023 and has dealt with injuries. The Roland Garros legend refused to call this year's edition his last in Paris, leaving the door open for a possible return in 2025.\n\nThus, Nadal will likely skip a farewell ceremony at his beloved tournament, planning to return in 12 months to compete or say his final goodbye to the French crowd. Rafa will play against world no. 4 Alexander Zverev in the first round at Roland Garros, facing a stern test and his earliest Parisian exit.\n\nDespite an in-form rival on the other side of the net, the Spaniard will give everything to prevail and score a notable victory on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nNadal trained with Sebastian Korda, Stan Wawrinka, Daniil Medvedev and Holger Rune ahead of the official action, shaping his form and hoping for a good run in his 116th Roland Garros match.\n\nThe veteran injured his left hip at last year's Australian Open, skipping the rest of the season and embracing the most challenging period of his career. Rafa trained well in the second part of the year and returned in Brisbane in the first week of 2024.\n\nNadal beat Dominic Thiem and Jason Kubler before experiencing another blow versus Jordan Thompson in the quarter-final. The Spaniard squandered three match points in a heartbreaking loss after nearly three and a half hours, feeling the pain around his hip again and missing the Australian Open.\n\nLike it was not enough, Nadal experienced abdominal issues in February, skipping Doha and Indian Wells and hoping to return during his favorite clay swing.\n\nThe veteran did not recover in time for Monte Carlo, and his first matches in 100 days came in Barcelona. Rafa fell to Alex de Minuar in the second round before earning three wins at the Madrid Masters. It was Nadal's best run since the 2022 US Open, and he could not repeat it in Rome, taking only four games against Hubert Hurkacz in the second round and wishing for a better result at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal and Zverev will continue their Roland Garros rivalry, battling in the semi-final two years ago for over three hours before the German hurt his ankle and retired in tears. Alexander will be the favorite, but no one should underestimate Rafa's chances, not at his beloved Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\n\"There is a good chance this will be my last Roland Garros. Luckily, I can not confirm that, which is excellent news. I do not have to close the door to what may come in the future and organize a farewell tribute this year.\n\nIf this is my final Roland Garros, I will return for a ceremony next year, but I would love to compete here in 2025,\" Rafael Nadal said.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jovica_ilic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Jovica Ilic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Wawrinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stan Wawrinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kubler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kubler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Thompson_(tennis)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Thompson (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149157.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Facing World No. 1 Novak Djokovic, the Spaniard led by two sets to one. He served for the match at 6-5 in the fourth set but the Serbian broke back and won the tiebreaker.\n\nIn a rollercoaster of a fifth set, Djokovic got the early break but lost his advantage in controversial fashion. In the eighth game, Djokovic hit a smash but before the ball could bounce twice, he slipped and hit the net, thus losing the point.\n\nNadal broke back to make it 4-4. The two players held their serve till 7-7 (there was no 10-point tiebreak at 6-6 in the final set back then) when Nadal broke again and then, served successfully for a place in the final.\n\nHis most recent deciding-set battle at Roland Garros took place in 2022. Playing against Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime, coached by the Spaniard's uncle Toni, Nadal led by two sets to one before Auger-Aliassime fought back to win the fourth set.

Another option is on Sling TV, which has promotional offers for new customers.\n\nNovak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek enter the tournament as the No. 1 seeds in men's and women's singles respectively. Both players won the French Open in 2023.\n\nThe top challengers to Djokovic are No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner, who won the 2024 Australian Open, and No. 3 seed Carlos Alcaraz, who won Wimbledon in 2023.\n\n2024 Australian Open winner Aryna Sabalenka is the No. 2 seed for the women, and Coco Gauff, who won the 2023 US Open, is the No. 3 seed.\n\nHere is what you need to know about the 2024 French Open:\n\nOne of the top stories of this year's French Open is that it might be Rafael Nadal's last appearance in a tournament that he has won 14 times. Here is more background on his potential final French Open from the Associated Press.\n\nIf this is, as expected, Rafael Nadal's final French Open, it will be one that everyone -- the 37-year-old Spaniard included -- surely will remember vividly.\n\nNo matter how healthy the guy everyone calls \"Rafa\" might be. No matter how long his stay in Paris lasts. No matter whether he somehow adds another championship at Roland Garros to the record 14 he owns.\n\nNarrator: Not even Nadal truly believes that is possible. Indeed, it wasn't even certain that he would be in the field until his name was placed in the bracket on Thursday -- and he was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev -- although Nadal has been practicing all week on site.\n\n\"I am not negative,\" he explained. \"I am just realistic.\"\n\nThink back just a couple of years ago to Serena Williams' farewell at the U.S. Open. That's the sort of atmosphere and adoration likely to be on display whenever Nadal swings a racket or simply strolls around the compact-for-a-Grand-Slam-grounds in the southwest section of the French capital where the clay-court tournament begins Sunday.\n\n\"I cannot predict what kind of emotions I am going to have there,\" said Nadal, who has been saying for a while that he thinks 2024 will be his final season before retirement. \"I just want to enjoy every day.\"\n\nThat's been difficult lately because of hip and abdominal muscle injuries that limited him to 20 matches, and a 9-11 record, over the past 20 months.\n\nNadal missed nearly all of 2023 after hurting his hip during a loss at the Australian Open that January. He had surgery almost exactly a year ago and sat out the French Open for the first time since making his debut there in 2005, when, naturally, he claimed the trophy at age 19.\n\nA torn hip muscle this January forced Nadal to miss the Australian Open; an ab problem sidelined him later. He returned in April, but in three places he's won a total of 27 titles -- Barcelona, Madrid, Rome -- Nadal made it no further than the fourth round anywhere and called himself \"unpredictable.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/QAA256XWRZHC3JGVBEYF53YSQQ.jpg?auth=a269f5113222eef679d1c89e0a4c1d170dcb16630486001bd4be46f4006832bb&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-03-26", "dateEnd": "2024-03-28", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 284}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-26", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 137}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 220, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

His eyes glistened with tears, and he waved to the audience, a gesture that felt like a heartfelt goodbye. The scene was a poignant reminder of the end of an era.\n\n\"Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment,\" even the winner Zverev said after the match on Monday.\n\n\"Thank you Rafa, from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a pro, I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court.\"\n\nSince the draw was made this year, the talk of the tournament was this highly-anticipated showdown since the Spaniard legend has indicated on multiple occasions that this year is likely to be his last season competing on the professional tennis circuit.\n\nThere was so much excitement for the match that Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and WTA No. 1 Iga Swiatek all sat in the stands to take in the action. The presence of these top players highlighted the significance of the moment, as they joined the crowd in honoring Nadal's incredible career.\n\nNadal's every move was met with thunderous applause and chants of \"Rafa! Rafa!\" echoing through the stadium. His signature grit and fighting spirit could still be found, but Zverev's relentless assault proved too much to overcome. The physical toll of years of gruelling competition was evident for the 37-year-old veteran, and as the match progressed, it became clear that this might not be the fairy-tale ending the fans had hoped for.\n\nAs the sun set over the storied courts of Roland Garros, a sense of anticipation and nostalgia filled the air.\n\n\"I've given my all on these courts for so many years. Today was difficult, but I am proud of everything I've achieved here,\" Nadal said with his voice tinged with emotion. \"Roland Garros will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nAt Roland Garros, from organizers to spectators, from tennis legends to rising stars, everyone sees Nadal as a symbol of the tournament. Once mention the French Ope, the Spaniard's name is invariably linked to it. The relationship between Nadal and the tournament is just like a wonderful love story - the Spaniard comes here for an annual date with Roland Garros, participates in the tournament, and wins the championship.\n\nThe Mallorca-born legend has left an indelible mark on this event with nearly 20 years of effort - 115 matches, 112 victories, 14 finals, and 14 titles before this year. No player in the history of the sport has ever dominated a single tournament like he has.\n\nEveryone knows how much people here love Nadal, but only by being here can you truly feel the depth of that affection -- No matter who his opponent is, Nadal always receives overwhelming support from the audience. No matter how late the match ends, his press conferences are almost always packed. Whether he wins or loses, he is always the one who captures everyone's emotions.\n\nFor many, Nadal's legacy extends beyond his records and titles. He has inspired countless fans and aspiring athletes with his dedication, sportsmanship, and indomitable spirit. His impact on the game of tennis is immeasurable, and his presence on the court will be profoundly missed.\n\nA slight consolation for the fans is that Nadal has not immediately announced his retirement. He even stated that he would do everything possible to participate in the tennis competition at the upcoming Olympics, which will be held at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The main goal for me now is the Olympics,\" Nadal told the press.", "source": {"uri": "industriesnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "industriesnews.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Nadal faced an early exit from Roland Garros after a defeat to world no. 4 Alexander Zverev in the first round of the competition on Monday, May 27.\n\nThe defeat marked not only his earliest exit from the French Open but also from his first Grand Slam appearance of the year, due to lingering injuries. Nadal last featured at the Wimbledon in 2022. He defeated Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals and withdrew before the semi-finals against Nick Kyrgios due to an abdominal strain. His absence would be a significant blow to Wimbledon, where he has claimed two championship titles.\n\nThis might be French Open champion Nadal's last Roland Garros after a tough loss to Zverev on Monday.

Two years after his glorious 2022 victory, when he was crowned champion for the fourteenth time by tournament by defeating the young Casper Ruud, the 37-year-old Spanish athlete has once again stepped onto the French tennis courts greeted by his fans with a warm ovation. His opponent this afternoon was the German tennis player, Alexander Zverev, currently ranked fourth in the ATP standings after his recent victory at the Rome Masters 1000.\n\nParis has always been a special place for Rafa Nadal, and his fans were hopeful for a remarkable return. However, despite a valiant effort, Nadal was unable to secure the win. Zverev defeated the Mallorcan athlete 6-3, 7-5 (5), 6-3 in a 3-hour and 5-minute match. This made the German player the fourth opponent to defeat Nadal at the French Open, where Nadal's record is now 4 losses out of 116 singles matches, giving him a winning rate of 97.4%.\n\nThis highly anticipated return comes after a 12-month hiatus due to a grade 2 injury to his left iliopsoas muscle, for which he underwent surgery last June at the Teknon Clinic in Barcelona. During that operation, an old injury to the labrum in his left hip was also addressed.\n\nFor this tournament, Nadal had the support of his loved ones. His wife, Mery Perell\u00f3, his sister, Maribel, his mother, Ana Mar\u00eda, his father, Sebasti\u00e1n, his uncles, and his mother-in-law, Mar\u00eda, were all present in the stands to cheer him on. His 16-month-old son Rafael, who had already captured everyone's attention at the Madrid Open, was also present.\n\nRafael Nadal is gradually saying goodbye to professional tennis. However, according to Amelie Mauresmo, the tournament director, it's very likely that he will return to Paris in 2025 because he wants to avoid a farewell tribute this year. \"He wants to keep his options open. We are not going to pressure him to make any decisions. It is his choice when he wants the recognition, which is why we won't be doing it this year,\" she explained.\n\nDuring an emotional speech after the match, Nadal said, \"Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am in peace with myself. I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nRoland Garros is the tournament that made Nadal famous. At just 19 years old, Rafa earned his first French Open trophy, known as the Coupe des Mousquetaires, becoming the eighth Spanish player to win it. He has repeated this accomplishment thirteen more times. Nearly two decades have passed, during which his fans have seen his highs and lows (especially during injury-filled seasons). Today the athlete has grown from a promising teenager into a celebrated tennis legend, family man and successful entrepreneur.", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliopsoas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iliopsoas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_des_Mousquetaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coupe des Mousquetaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.hola.com/us/images/028d-1afda45270e4-552ca7f97715-1000/horizontal-800/2154903863-collage-u35116771563eka.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot\n\nTags Wire Dcc

Apart from Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were also present in the stands to see Nadal play.\n\nThis was Nadal's first match in a Grand slam this year as he was forced out of the Australian Open due to an injury.

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe prolonged closing chapter of greats, particularly in an arena as inconsistent and undependable as professional sport, is a true tribulation of the mind. It's like the blowing of a long-standing bulb: you flick the switch - more than once, as much as thrice - in a subconscious instruction to your brain that it cannot be time to recycle and replace. But sometimes there can be no denying the undeniable, no matter how unpalatable. Power is not possible anymore.\n\nYet over the past two decades, there has frankly been nothing as constant and dependable as Rafael Nadal at Roland-Garros. 18 appearances, 14 titles, one king of clay. Domination unparalleled not just in tennis, but in the history of sport. Yet ultimately, father time fools nobody.\n\nAnd so it came to pass that, after 116 matches, Nadal lost in week one at the French Open for the first time. Handed the toughest first-round draw possible - against the tour's most in-form, injury-free player - Alexander Zverev packed a punch to brutally dismiss any notion of a glorious swansong, triumphing 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3.\n\nTwo years on from rupturing ankle ligaments under the Phillipe-Chatrier roof, as Nadal progressed to what surely will be his final title in Paris, the German earned his stripes in the same setting and put his name in the history-books. For Novak Djokovic (2015, 2021) and Robin Soderling (2009), see Alexander Zverev (2024): men to defeat Rafa on Chatrier.\n\nCome the finale, as modern greats Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek watched on like simple punters, Nadal took centre stage and waved goodbye. Briefly, the sun glinted through the open-plan roof, glistening onto this venue's omnipresent champion. On a gloomy day in western Paris, it was an apt conclusion.\n\nWhat now? We know, fitness permitting, it won't be his final appearance on these courts. Nadal, gold medallist in Beijing 16 years ago, plans to play the Olympic Games this summer and post-match again refused to rule out reurning to his favourite Grand Slam next year. Yet, in all honesty and in a similar vein to Andy Murray's defeat last night, it felt like the fire - and the fumes - have finally been put out. He also later confirmed in his press conference that he doesn't think he will play Wimbledon in a month's time.\n\nNadal, seven days shy of 38, entered his home from home to the most explosive of collective cheers. If we didn't know better, with the beat of the drum, the tune of the horn and the unashamedly partisan Parisian crowd on this Monday afternoon in May, it could have been an old-school Davis Cup tie in Spain.\n\nBut of course, we do know better. This is Court Phillipe-Chatrier: a tennis colosseum of crushed brick surface dominated by one left-handed man from Mallorca for two decades. Nadal had only lost three of his previous 115 matches in this tournament yet the 14-time champion came into this first-round clash ranked 272 places below the fourth-seeded Zverev. In Nadal's theatre, with the public paying to see one of the greats, the 27-year-old was the favourite.\n\nAnd the first point of this three-hour plus match, under the roof where the duo had vied so gallantly two years ago, summed up the first set. A routine rally: Nadal's forehand cross-court to Zverev's backhand cross-court. In years gone by, Nadal's heavy weight of shot would overpower all that came before it but, here, a limp drop-shot into the net almost seemed like an early wave of the white flag. In a flash, Zverev broke Nadal to love.\n\nThe first set ended with a similar surrender. With Zverev serving for the set, another Nadal drop-shot was brilliantly chased down by the younger, fresher player on court. Nadal applauded his opponent - sportsman first, athlete second - before clapping again prior to a pivotal first serve. Was it still on his mind? The Spaniard quickly missed on his forehand wing and the first set was gone.\n\nWhat was clear from the start here, and has been evident since his return in Barcelona last month, is that Nadal's powers of yesteryear are waning. He knows it, we all know it.\n\nShots off both the forehand and backhand side regularly failed to pass the service line, triggering Zverev to gleefully gobble up any fresh meat with some booming winners. It took until 68 minutes for Nadal to hit his first ace; an ace which looked like a turning point, as he held serve early in the second and then broke for the first time, celebrating with that iconic leap and pump into the air.\n\nBut when it mattered most Nadal, serving for the set, was again broken to love. It was crunch time and, for a moment, we were greeted to Nadal's most authoritative of attributes: his extraordinary levels of fight. Sheer grit, scraping and screeching his way across the court, adrenaline pumping as the cacophony of noise reached ear-piercing levels.\n\nTo a tiebreak they went. A tiebreak Nadal - in his first best-of-five set match in 16 months - simply had to claim. And again, it's time to talk about the drop shot.\n\nA tactic regularly, naively, persevered with arguably cost Nadal this breaker. One poorly-executed on the backhand wing gifted Zverev two set points. The frustration was palpable and at 6-5, a backhand return into the net from Nadal gave Zverev a lead he would not relinquish.\n\nOf course, Nadal continued to fight. He won a ridiculous, topsy-turvy fifth game on serve. But he was then broken and despite spirited encouragement from the crowd, the light was fading fast. With that famous forehand inside-out flying long, Zverev was victorious in straight-sets. He moves on, in search of major No 1.\n\nFor Nadal, as per request, there was no heart-wrenching video montage. Instead, just an interview of paradoxes: it felt like the final time, even though he insisted it may not be the final time. Desperate to squeeze every last drop out of a career which has given him, and his fans, the journey of a lifetime, he wants to come back in 2025. Fundamentally, he loves the game, the competition, the battle.\n\nThe lightbulb has not quite gone out, but it's flickering, sporadically, and on the verge of a blackout.", "source": {"uri":

I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you, honestly,\" Nadal said. \"I am not 100 percent sure, but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\n\n\"The crowd has been amazing during the whole week of preparation and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words. But for me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.\"\n\nIn other action today, No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner of Italy defeated Christopher Eubanks in straight sets and ninth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece advanced in straight sets over Hungary's Marton Fucsovics, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nNo. 15 Ben Shelton rallied to beat Hugo Gaston of France after dropping the opening set and No. 21 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada advanced in straight sets with a victory over Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka.\n\nGerman qualifier Henri Square beat

By ATPTour.com/es Staff\n\n\"It wasn't to be, but I was close to having a real chance of doing something big. That's how I feel.\"\n\nOne sentence from Rafael Nadal provides huge insight into what was going through the Spaniard's mind during the days leading up to Roland Garros: the quality of his practice sessions, as well as a lack of physical ailments for the first time in many months led the Mallorcan to believe in his chances of winning another Coupe des Mousquetaires.\n\n\"I was ready to take steps forward by winning several matches,\" explained the 22-time major champion after losing to Alexander Zverev on Monday.\n\n\"It's something I haven't felt at any other tournament, and here I did,\" he added, referring to his recent outings in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome.\n\n\"I played a good match, taking into account how I arrived. At times I played well, really well. In other moments I made mistakes, but you can't build a house in two days. Even though I played in previous tournaments, I had a week here practising without limits. That's the reality, only the week before Roland Garros.\"\n\nNadal was progressing in practice leading up to his 19th appearance at the tournament he has dominated for two decades. But luck drew no favours for the 37-year-old as a result of playing with a protected ranking and being unseeded. Nadal would face fourth seed Zverev in his opener.\n\nAlthough Nadal took it as a challenge, doubling down on his motivation and desire, in reality, he had a mountain to climb. Playing his opener against the German, the recent champion in Rome, was too soon.\n\n\"I managed to play without limitations, I fought and I had real chances of taking the match to a completely different situation against one of the best players in the world,\" said Nadal. \"Two things prevented me from doing it -- he is very good, and I needed more [matches] to play with instinct in all those moments and to get the confidence to understand what I had to do in those key points.\n\nNadal explained that despite the loss, he is pleased with the physical progress he has made this clay-court swing.\n\n\"The last few months have been very intense in every regard. I'm proud of everything I've been through to get here. I've always had the help of everyone, every day: family, my team, friends... It would have been impossible without them,\" he said.\n\n\"There were a lot of lows, genuine lows, and many months with no light at the end of the tunnel. I stayed disciplined, but always hopeful, going every day to train and do things as well as I could to have a chance of making it here. And in the end I did it.\n\n\"I'm going to take a few days and I'll see how I feel. In my head, I'll play the Olympics and then we'll see.\"\n\nNadal maintains the hope that he can play the 2024 Olympic Games at Roland Garros, where he could represent his country for the final time in his illustrious career.\n\n\"I'm confident I'll be well prepared when I get there, but at the Olympic Games I'll be in the same situation I'm in now. I could face anyone in the first round,\" said Nadal. \"It's a completely different situation to what I've had for the rest of my career, regardless of any problems I may have had. If I arrive fit and well -- hopefully a little better than today, and feeling that I've had a month and a half more of practice and confidence -- I'll come here and enjoy the Olympics. Who knows what might happen afterwards.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_des_Mousquetaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coupe des Mousquetaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/28/19/03/nadal-roland-garros-2024-spanish-reaction.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

I hope you understand.\n\n'I don't want to 100 per cent close the door, because of very simple things. First, I am enjoying playing tennis. Second, I am travelling with the family. And third, I was not able to explore yet how I will be able to play being more or less healthy, playing without limitation.\n\nRafael Nadal has heavily suggested that this would be his final season on the ATP Tour\n\nBut when the Spaniard was asked whether this would be his final French Open, he replied: 'Don't assume that'\n\nNadal urged fans to give him some time to make a decision over his future and whether he'll return to Roland Garros\n\n'So give me some time. Maybe in one month and a half I say, OK, it's enough, I can't keep going, but today I cannot guarantee this is going to be the last one.'\n\nHow will the Brits fare?\n\nSunday\n\nJack Draper (world ranking 35) v Jesper De Jong (Ned, WR 177)\n\nDe Jong will be full of confidence after three wins to qualify. Draper, 22, should still expect to get his first ever win at the French Open.\n\nAndy Murray (WR 75) v Stan Wawrinka (Swi, WR 97)\n\nMurray leads head to head 13-9 but Wawrinka has won five of their six meetings on clay. They have just seven tour-level wins between them this year.\n\nMonday\n\nHarriet Dart (WR 91) v Linda Noskova (Cze, No 27 seed)\n\nDart has played a lot of good tennis this year to make the top 100. Noskova, 19, is a serious talent and Dart will struggle to live with her.\n\nCam Norrie (No 32 seed) v Pavel Kotov (Rus, WR57)\n\nKotov, 25, has had a good clay court season and will look to inflict damage with his booming forehand. Norrie should be too consistent for his opponent.\n\nTuesday\n\nDan Evans (WR 60) v Holger Rune (Den, No 13 seed)\n\nEvans, 34, has only three tour-level wins this year and last week split from coach Sebastian Prieto. Rune is not having his best season but will surely have too much.\n\nKatie Boulter (No 26 seed) v Paula Badosa (Sp, WR 140)\n\nThe British No 1 makes her main-draw debut. Former world No2 Badosa is rebuilding after a stress fracture of the back but she will be a tough nut to crack.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNadal cut a very different figure than the one we have seen during a torturous clay swing so far.\n\nHe has a 'super-tough' first-round draw against No 4 seed Alexander Zverev, but reported that his body is at last beginning to co-operate.\n\n'This is the first week since I came back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations.\n\n'That's encouraging. Of course that doesn't mean I'm going to be out there on Monday and play incredible.\n\n'But this place is magical for me -- a lot of times things happened that were difficult to imagine.\n\n'If, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and create a beautiful thing this year, I would not be here.\n\n'I still have the motivation and a small -- at least a small -- hope to play well.'\n\nBefore he spoke to the media, 10,000 fans packed into Court Suzanne Lenglen just to watch the 22-time Grand Slam champion practice.\n\nIf Nadal is not yet ready to say goodbye to tennis, then tennis is also just as reluctant to bid farewell to him.\n\nDespite his positive soundings, all logic suggests Nadal will fall at the first hurdle to Zverev tomorrow.\n\nThat would leave a power vacuum in this year's tournament and it is not easy to predict who will fill it.\n\nThree-time champion Novak Djokovic arrives in Paris having not made a single final this year.\n\nAfter surprisingly losing in the semis to Czech Tomas Machac in Geneva on Friday night, the 37-year-old talked mysteriously of 'horrible feelings on court' and 'other things on (his) mind'.\n\nNormal service may resume once the serious business of adding to his 24 Grand Slam titles begins, but the evidence against that supposition is mounting.\n\nThe two men best placed to take advantage of a below-par Djokovic ought to be Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz and Australian Open winner Jannik Sinner, but they have been dealing with arm and hip issues respectively.\n\nIf he gets past Nadal, Zverev, who won the Italian Open title last weekend, could be the one to take advantage in what, on the men's side, is shaping up to be France's most open Open for 20 years.\n\nZverev (left) and Nadal (right) met at the French Open semi-finals in 2022, with the former retiring with an ankle injury\n\nZverev claimed victory in Rome last week after, but will now face Nadal in the first round in Paris\n\nIf Nadal is not yet ready to say goodbye to tennis, then tennis is also just as reluctant to bid farewell to him\n\nIga Swiatek has lost just twice at Roland Garros during her career and has three French Open titles\n\nThe women's event looks far easier to call. World No 1 Iga Swiatek has lost just twice here in her career, winning three titles, and has an 89 per cent win rate on clay. The biggest threat to the Pole is world No 2, Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nThe tempestuous Belarusian is developing a compelling rivalry with the tranquil Swiatek.\n\nThey have contested the last two big events, with Swiatek winning both. 'I'll get you in Roland Garros,' joked Sabalenka after Rome.\n\nShe was well beaten there but her display in a pulsating Madrid final has earned her a clay-court trilogy fight in Paris. That would be this tournament's dream final.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Reuters.\n\nFourteen-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal said there was still a chance this year's tournament in Paris may not be his last, in comments ahead of his tough opener against fourth seed Alexander Zverev.\n\nThe Spaniard, who turns 38 next month, skipped last year's tournament due to a hip injury that needed surgery and has said he expects to retire at the end of 2024.\n\nBut he wasn't ready to repeat those words on Saturday.\n\n\"If I have to tell you it's 100 per cent my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand,\" Nadal told a packed press conference.\n\n\"I don't want to close 100 per cent the door. First, I'm enjoying playing tennis,\" he said, adding that he was \"more or less healthy .. and playing without limitation\".\n\n\"Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going'. But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one.\"\n\nNadal skipped the Australian Open in January with a muscle problem, and the 22-time grand slam champion had raised doubts about his fitness for the year's second major with lingering issues in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome.\n\nNadal turned his attention to Monday's clash with Zverev, a rematch of the 2022 semi-final when the German retired after an ankle injury.\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal said, referring to a second-round defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian capital this month.\n\nNovak 'not a favourite'\n\nWorld No.1 Novak Djokovic said he does not consider himself a favourite ahead of his title defence here, which begins with a first-round match against local hope Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Sunday.\n\nDjokovic's barren run ahead of Roland Garros continued as the 24-time grand slam winner was beaten 4-6, 6-0, 1-6 by Tomas Machac in the Geneva Open semi-finals on Friday, weeks after losing heavily to Alejandro Tabilo in Rome.\n\n\"Of course I am worried... I haven't been playing good at all this year,\"the 37-year-old said. Asked about his title defence in Paris, Djokovic said: \"(I've had) some (good) matches here and there but it is what it is. You have to accept it. I don't consider myself a favourite there.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\u00e1\u0161_Mach\u00e1\u010d", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mach\u00e1\u010d"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Tabilo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Tabilo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Hugues_Herbert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre-Hugues Herbert"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/May/1716684234_nadal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

After missing the majority of 2023 through injury Nadal has fought back to fitness in recent months, before squaring off against a top-form Zverev, who just clinched the Italian Open.\n\nUltimately, any dreams of a fairytale run in Paris were dashed for Nadal, who appeared overcome by emotion after the defeat. And it backs up McEnroe, who criticized the decision-making around Nadal, arguing that it was absurd for someone of his calibre not to be seeded.\n\nREAD MORE: Emotional Rafael Nadal suffers first-round defeat on likely French Open farewell\n\nREAD MORE: French Open 2024 tennis star is married to notorious ex-Premier League flop\n\n\"It doesn't make sense for someone who has won 14 times not to be seeded,\" McEnroe expressed to Marca. \"It's the way the tournament has always acted. It's crazy to me. It's the most interesting first round of a major that I can remember and the toughest of the Open Era for someone like Nadal.\n\n\"He has to do whatever he wants. He loves to compete and if he loses to Zverev it doesn't mean that all his records at Roland Garros will be lost. Maybe it's time for him to be a father and it's time for everyone. Maybe I'm wrong and he'll be able to do something special here. It's a question mark as to how his body will recover as the rounds go by. If he wins on the one hand it will be a surprise and on the other not.\n\n\"If you asked me ten years ago how many times he was going to take the trophy I would have said four or five. People like him, Novak (Djokovic) or Roger (Federer) are Superman.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nThe Spanish star reflected on his exit from the tournament in an emotional address, as he said: \"It is difficult for me to talk, I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 was a tough moment for you so you deserve it.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here. The first round wasn't ideal. I was competitive and I had chances but it was difficult against a player as good as Sasha.\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared.\"\n\nDue to his fitness struggles, Nadal has dropped to world No. 276 in recent times. Despite McEnroe's objections that the rules should be adjusted for the 37-year-old 'King of Clay', he had to enter the French Open unseeded for the first time in his career.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_beattie@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tom Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jack_mceachen@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jack McEachen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McEnroe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McEnroe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marca_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marca (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32911680.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_nfl-19.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0

He's a monument at this tournament,\" said 41-year-old Manolo who has come to Europe from the United States to watch Nadal and then Real Madrid play in the Champions League final in London this Saturday.\n\nHe has seen Nadal win at Wimbledon and the US Open as well as Paris but admitted Monday's clash with world number four Zverev \"would be very difficult\".\n\n\"I hope he beats Zverev... Rafa is Rafa,\" he said.\n\n\"It's possibly the last time he plays here, so we're very happy to watch him,\" said Alsi, a 40-year-old fan living in Australia.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genoa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Genoa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/c15a0d6e-1c5b-11ef-a408-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b8085ce4de36425df1b069fcc0c1f9c0389c02a4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Ra-fa! \" whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.\n\nThe 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called \"magical for me.\" When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point.\n\nThe problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At least I did,\" Nadal said. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\"\n\nHe had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again.\n\nHe reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place.\n\n\"I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands.\n\nWhile Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site.\n\nMonday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect,\" Nadal said. \"I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances.\n\nThat is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\nDjokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion.\n\nHere and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell \"Vamos!\" and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their redand-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum.\n\nIf Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon's coos were audible from a corner of the stadium.\n\nNadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to corral groundstrokes.\n\nAs he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won't be there.\n\nOn Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest.\n\nIn the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead.\n\nRoars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker.\n\nAt the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, \"Vamos!\"\n\nMore roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately.\n\n\"To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,\" he explained, \"you need to be playing often.\"\n\nAddressing the fans directly, Nadal said: \"The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don't know. Merci beaucoup.\"\n\nAnd with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant.\n\n\"Ra-fa!

And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place.\n\nWhen it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\"\n\nIt is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open.\n\nThe match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed.\n\nToday's Top Headlines SRS walking tours revisit former town of Ellenton 'Thank you for my freedom': Aiken parade marks Memorial Day weekend List of alleged broken promises by Weeping Willows developer continues to grow Late Burnettown mayor Hector Rodriguez recognized at Memorial Day ceremony SRMC welcomes largest class of summer interns Today's events for May 27 Aiken man accused of committing bank fraud regarding wealthy Aiken woman's will Curry and Larlee win member-guest at Palmetto St. Paul to hold final celebration concert featuring pipe organ and voices Grayson Murray dies at age 30 a day after withdrawing from Colonial, PGA Tour says\n\nNadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time.\n\nThat is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years.\n\nNadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021.\n\n\"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment.

it was announced afterwards that he had sustained torn ligaments and required season-ending surgery.\n\nNadal's victory on retirement was his seventh success from 10 previous battles against Zverev, whom he also bested in straight sets in the 2021 Italian Open quarters, prior to which the reigning Rome champion had earned three triumphs on the bounce against his more experienced foe.\n\nBefore Nadal's body began to fail him, the 22-time major winner prevailed in each of his first five battles against Zverev, most notably a five-set Australian Open thriller in 2017 and a three-set Italian Open final in 2018, which remains their solitary meeting with a trophy on the line.\n\nWe say: Zverev to win in three sets\n\nThis was a particularly painful prediction to type out. While Nadal's unparalleled French Open achievements, unprecedented love for clay and unrivalled support from the Roland-Garros crowd all work in his favour, the form book is just too hard to ignore on this occasion.\n\nThe veteran Spaniard is also yet to be tested in a best-of-five battle in the 2024 season, but we cannot envisage him taking an in-form Zverev to the distance, and the German fourth seed should storm to the success that may close Nadal's French Open chapter for good.\n\nID:544553:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7983:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_knapton@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Ben Knapton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Western_&_Southern_Open_\u2013_Men's_singles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 Western & Southern Open \u2013 Men's singles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_des_Mousquetaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coupe des Mousquetaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_de_Minaur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex de Minaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte-Carlo_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monte-Carlo Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goffin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Goffin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/19/rafael-nadal.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 819, "textEnd": 825}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 2871, "textEnd": 2877}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a pro.\"\n\nNadal, ranked 275 at the moment, had never played Roland-Garros unseeded, and never faced a top-10 player in the first round.\n\n\"I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player like Sascha,\" Nadal said after the match.\n\nZverev's aggressive play set the tone in the first set. The two-time ATP Finals champion took the action to his opponent, hitting 15 winners compared to five for Nadal in the opener.\n\nNadal faced two break points early in the second set to fall into a deep deficit despite chants of \"Rafa! Rafa!\" in and outside the stadium. After digging out of trouble, he conjured memories of his very best tennis to claim a service break and lead by 3-2.\n\nBut his rival responded quickly with another break before claiming a tense tiebreak to take a two-set lead.\n\nAfter Nadal missed a final shot on match point, Zverev gave a muted celebration out of respect for the 22-time major champion. They enjoyed a warm greeting at the net.\n\nFor now, Nadal will look to continue testing himself against the best players in the world, with plans to be back in Paris for the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nWorld No.1 Swiatek opened her title defence with a trademark performance, thriving as the frontrunner to dispatch local underdog Jeanjean in just one hour.\n\nThe Pole had arrived at Roland-Garros on a 12-match winning streak off the back of collecting WTA 1000 titles in Madrid and Rome.\n\n\"It feels like home here,\" the three-time champion said.\n\nReigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner also clinched a straight-set victory as the Italian beat American Christopher Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to progress.\n\nHome favourite Varvara Gracheva produced the biggest upset of the first round so far as the world No.88 came from a set down to defeat No.6 seed Maria Sakkari 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.\n\nSakkari is the first Top 10 seed to fall through the first two days of the tournament. Reigning Wimbledon champion and No.5 seed Marketa Vondrousova dropped just four games in her opening victory over Rebeka Masarova, winning 6-1, 6-3 to advance.", "source": {"uri": "khmertimeskh.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khmer Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9olia_Jeanjean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9olia Jeanjean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varvara_Gracheva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varvara Gracheva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Eubanks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Eubanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sakkari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Sakkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeka_Masarova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeka Masarova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/82623.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

But ... because he doesn't know if it's going to be his last Roland Garros or not, he wants to leave the door open maybe to come back next year as a player. So we are not going to push him, obviously, to do anything,\" Mauresmo said.\n\n\"It's his decision when he wants to have a proper ceremony, a proper goodbye, a proper farewell. So we're not going to do it this year. That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it.

Jeff and Harold Grindstaff take Week 2 of Friday night tournament on Lake James NCHSAA releases 2024 baseball and softball playoff brackets\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3 and has said previously he expects this to be his last season, will face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round on Monday. The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national

But his towering opponent was too steep a mountain to climb for the ageing Spaniard, whose career twilight has been blighted by injury.\n\nNadal had played only four tournaments since January 2023 after undergoing hip surgery and then suffering a muscle tear. He arrived in Paris ranked a lowly 276th in the world, on the back of a straight sets humbling in Rome at the hands of Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.\n\nFears of an equally undignified exit at Roland Garros appeared to materialise when Nadal lost his opening serve game to love. But the Spaniard quickly recovered, throwing his heart into a close-fought battle that did justice to his extraordinary career.\n\nEarlier on, there was a deafening roar as the players walked onto court and the master of ceremonies gave a rundown of Nadal's 14 French Open titles, starting with his maiden win in 2005 as a long-haired, sleeveless teenager.\n\nThe hair thinned out over the years, and the outfits got tamer, but Rafa remained the indisputable 'King of Clay' for close to two decades.\n\n'I didn't want to play Rafa'\n\nThe unenviable task of drawing the curtain on Nadal's French Open career fell to Zverev, the German 4th seed who left this same court in a wheelchair after twisting his ankle when they last met in the semi-finals two years ago.\n\n\"I can guarantee you Novak (Djokovic) didn't want to play Rafa in the first round and (Carlos) Alcaraz didn't want to play, Jannik (Sinner) didn't want to play him,\" Zverev said ahead of the match. \"I don't want to play him in the first round, but it is how it is.\"\n\nZverev arrived in Paris as one of the favourites for the title after winning the Rome Open earlier this month. The 27-year-old has long been touted as a future Grand Slam champion but remains without one of tennis' four biggest titles.\n\nWith the likes of Djokovic, Sinner and Alcaraz all recovering from injuries, this may be Zverev's best chance yet, and on his preferred surface too.\n\nThe lanky German was in ruthless form as he stormed to an early lead against Nadal, saving two break points at 3-1 in the opening set. The Spaniard saved two set points on his own serve at 3-5 but gave up the opener on the third when he buried a loose forehand into the net.\n\nTellingly, Zverev had hit 15 winners to Nadal's five.\n\nA tighter contest, the second set saw Nadal save two break points to go to 2-2, celebrating his winning forehand with a leap, punch and scream of \"Vamos\". He then broke for first time to lead 3-2 courtesy of a pinpoint drop shot with Zverev stranded at the back of the court.\n\nNadal was then broken to love in the 10th game as he served for the set. He then saved one set point in a tense tie-break, only for Zverev to claim the set when the Spaniard netted a service return.\n\n'Forever the greatest'\n\nNadal's fans had descended en masse on a chilly and damp Roland Garros, hoping to carry their hero to an unlikely win. Many lined up for a selfie at the \"Rafa monument\", a stainless steel sculpture three metres high and almost five metres wide, located near the entrance to the stadium.\n\n\"I wouldn't have missed this day for the world,\" said 45-year-old Andr\u00e8s, posing for a picture with his friends from Alicante in Spain, each of them sporting a \"Gracias Rafa\" (Thank you Rafa) T-shirt.\n\n\"Rafa is a model to us, an example of modesty, of courage and fighting spirit,\" he added. \"He is forever the greatest, whatever happens today.\"\n\nAndr\u00e8s still harboured hopes of seeing Nadal back in Paris next year. He added: \"A part of Roland Garros will be missing once he is gone.\"\n\nThis was expected to be Nadal's final appearance at the French Open, but the Spaniard has been more cryptic about his future since arriving in Paris, telling reporters he could not confirm \"100 percent\" this would be his farewell to Roland Garros.\n\n\"Maybe the last one, maybe not,\" he told a packed press conference on Saturday. \"I hope to be clear. I don't want to create a big confusion, but I'm enjoying what I am doing.\"\n\nFrench Open organisers were prepared to stage a tribute ceremony to Nadal to honour his career, but the Spaniard was reluctant to endorse such a celebration.\n\n\"We were ready to press the button on it,\" admitted tournament director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo. \"But it's Rafa who manages his timing, we follow what he wants.\"", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_dodman@france24.com", "name": "Benjamin Dodman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am\u00e9lie_Mauresmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicante", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alicante"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.france24.com/media/display/96422944-1c43-11ef-b92c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/image6-4.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

What was turning out to be an absolute thriller ended abruptly with an unfortunate injury for Zverev at that time.\n\nTwo years later, the two players will meet again but in different circumstances. Zverev is close to being back to his level before that ankle injury. He arrived in Paris after winning the Italian Open. On the other hand, the 37-year-old Nadal has mostly been away from professional tennis since sustaining a hip injury at the Australian Open last season.\n\nREAD | Why Rafael Nadal will not have a farewell ceremony at Roland Garros this year\n\nHe made his comeback in Brisbane but another injury forced him to skip the Australian Open and delayed his return till the clay season began. He played in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome and has a 5-3 win-loss record on the surface before coming to the French capital for what will be his 19th campaign at Roland Garros.\n\nNadal is ranked 275th in the world and is unseeded at a Major for the first time since Australian Open in 2005.\n\nIf Zverev beats Nadal, it would just be the fourth defeat in 116 matches for the Spaniard at the French Open but the earliest one. He has never failed to reach at least the fourth round in Paris.\n\nWhen and where to watch?\n\nFrench Open 2024 first-round clash between Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev is set to begin around 6PM IST on Monday, May 27. You can watch the live telecast of the French Open on the Sony Sports Network and stream the matches live on SonyLiv and JioTV.\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nPlayed:10 | Nadal: 7 | Zverev: 3\n\nNadal and Zverev have faced each other 10 times on the ATP Tour. Their first meeting took place in the round of 16 at Indian Wells in 2016 where the Spaniard won 6-7(8), 6-0, 7-5. In their latest meeting, Nadal led 7-6(8), 6-6 during the semifinals at French Open two years ago when Zverev twisted his ankle and was forced to retire.\n\nYEAR TOURNAMENT ROUND WINNER SCORE 2022 FRENCH OPEN SEMIFINAL NADAL 7-6(8), 6-6, retd. 2021 ITALIAN OPEN QUARTERFINAL NADAL 6-3, 6-4 2021 MADRID OPEN QUARTERFINAL ZVEREV 6-4, 6-4 2020 PARIS MASTERS SEMIFINAL ZVEREV 6-4, 7-5 2019 ATP FINALS ROUND ROBIN ZVEREV 6-2, 6-4 2018 ITALIAN OPEN FINAL NADAL 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 2018 DAVIS CUP WORLD GROUP QUARTERFINAL NADAL 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 2017 MONTE-CARLO MASTERS ROUND OF 16 NADAL 6-1, 6-1 2017 AUSTRALIAN OPEN ROUND OF 32 NADAL 4-6, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-2 2016 INDIAN WELLS MASTERS ROUND OF 16 NADAL 6-7(8), 6-0, 7-5Latest on SportstarRafael Nadal vs Alexander Zverev, French Open 2024: Preview, Head-to-head record, live streaming infoTeam SportstarFrench Open 2024: All you need to know about the prestigious Roland Garros Team SportstarFrench Open 2024, May 27 schedule: Nadal vs Zverev marquee clash;

Nadal began the second set on a strong note, and got a 4-2 lead. But the German fought back in the 10th game, saving two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by winning a thrilling tiebreak.\n\nThen in the third set, he took a 2-0 lead, but again gave it away as Zverev sealed a win.\n\nSpeaking after the match, he said, \"The amount of energy.. It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's gonna be the last time here in front of all of you. I'm not sure. But if it's the last time I enjoyed it.

Maybe in 2 months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. That's going to be another chance,\" he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Zverev said, \"Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It is such a great honour.

As author and former New York Times tennis writer Christopher Clarey wrote in his Substack email article, Nadal \"has been resisting the word retirement like it is a break point.\" Earlier this year, the Laver Cup even announced that Nadal would be a member of Team Europe in its September event, perhaps indicating that Nadal would have a farewell in the team event like his greatest rival Roger Federer did in 2022.\n\nIn his post-match comments after his straight-sets first-round loss to No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev, Nadal seemed determined to return to Paris this summer to his favorite clay courts and compete for Spain in the Olympic Games. The International Tennis Federation, which oversees the Olympic tennis competition, confirmed via a social post on X (formerly Twitter) that Nadal's ATP protected ranking of No. 9 could be used to gain entry into the Olympic Games, also played at Roland Garros. He could also be paired in doubles with his Spanish heir apparent Carlos Alcaraz. When asked if would consider another trip to play at Wimbledon in July, Nadal begged off saying that playing on the grass courts at the All England Club would not be wise if he wanted to play again on the clay at the Olympic Games.\n\nSo Nadal's first-round loss to Zverev looks only to be the closing bookend to his career at the French Championships, which he won in his first visit there in 2005 as a 19-year-old. As Clarey wrote, \"Nadal's straight-set defeat to Alexander Zverev at the French Open did not quite feel like a full-circle moment....But full circle would also imply the end, and though the understandable assumption has been that this is Nadal's farewell tour it is beginning to seem much more like a warmup act for the farewell tour.\" And Clarey, perhaps more than anybody outside of Nadal's family and his close inner circle, would know best as he has meticulously written and researched Nadal for his upcoming book \"The Warrior.\"\n\nWe will see him again.\n\nOh, and did we mention lucrative exhibition matches against Roger Federer as early as 2025???", "source": {"uri": "worldtennismagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Tennis Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bj\u00f6rn_Borg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bj\u00f6rn Borg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laver_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laver Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "http://www.worldtennismagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ITFNadalPost.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Wimbledon gets underway on July 1, with the Olympic tennis tournament starting less than a month later on July 27.\n\n\"It looks difficult,\" Nadal, who won singles gold at Beijing 2008, said of his Wimbledon prospects. \"Honestly, I can't confirm what's going on, but for me, now it looks difficult to make the transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay.\n\n\"So I cannot confirm anything, I need to talk with the team, I need to analyze so many facts, but I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today, I feel that's not a good idea. I can't confirm, but my feeling is, even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nNadal is also set to play in the doubles at Paris 2024 with Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThe 37-year-old has struggled with injury since the 2023 Australian Open and was forced to miss the vast majority of last season as he tried to get his body ready for one last year on tour.\n\nAfter previously announcing that 2024 would likely be his last year in professional tennis, Nadal opened the door to a possible return in 2025 after his defeat to Zverev, saying he is \"not 100% sure\" the loss was his final appearance at Roland Garros.\n\nBut given his injury struggles over the last 18 months, Nadal admitted that, even if prioritizes being fit for the Olympics, there is no guarantee he will be.\n\n\"I cannot tell you if I will be or won't be in one month and a half,\" Nadal said. \"My body has been a jungle for two years and you don't know what to expect.

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0

But he wasn't ready to repeat those words on Saturday.\n\n\"If I have to tell you it's 100 percent my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand,\" Mr. Nadal told a packed press conference.\n\n\"I don't want to close 100 percent the door, because it's a very simple thing. First, I'm enjoying playing tennis,\" he said, adding that he was \"more or less healthy .. and playing without limitation.\"\n\n\"Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going.' But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one.\"\n\nMr. Nadal skipped the Australian Open in January with a muscle problem, and the 22-times Grand Slam champion had raised doubts about his fitness for the year's second major with lingering issues in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome. \"I'm feeling better. That's the truth,\" Mr. Nadal added, appearing more cheerful than he has in recent months.\n\nMr. Nadal turned his attention to Monday's clash with Mr. Zverev, a rematch of the 2022 semifinal when the German retired after an ankle injury.\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round,\" he said.\n\nMaybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal said, referring to a second-round defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian capital this month.\n\n\"But in my mind is something different, play much better and give myself a chance to be competitive... I didn't play this level of opponents, being competitive since a super-long time.\n\n\"So all these questions I understand that you're making to me I'm asking to myself too. But the answer is going to be on Monday, no? That's it.\n\n\"The rest of the things are just talking and talking, and in the end don't matter. It's about my feelings and my feelings are better.

However, with no official confirmation on the time as of Saturday, Nadal and his team, according to a report in L'Equipe, put in a request to not play the match in the night session and the organisers agreed, with the 22-time Grand Slam winner scheduled for an afternoon match against Zverev (3:30 PM IST).\n\nIt will be an advantage Nadal with the French Open scheduling the popcorn round-one clash on Monday afternoon. The conditions in the day, with less humidity, will allow the ball to not get heavy, a factor that could work in Nadal's favor. His powerful forehand, a signature move, could inflict much more damage under these conditions.\n\nThis was evident in the Madrid Masters last month, where Nadal played his first three matches in the afternoon and comfortably claimed victories in all, including one against world No. 10 Alex de Minaur. In the only match he played in the night session, Nadal lost to Jiri Lehecka in straight sets. The change of schedule was because Nadal required some rest.\n\nHowever, the outcome of the match is still uncertain, and Zverev's skills cannot be underestimated.\n\nOverall, Nadal enjoys a dominating 7-3 lead in the head-to-head record against Zverev.

Today I feel that's not a good idea.\"\n\nWith Nadal a two-time Wimbledon winner, having tasted victory in London in both 2008 and 2010, this news will no doubt come as a disappointment to fans.\n\nBut they may well be slightly more understanding of the decision after hearing his exciting plans for his Roland Garros return in the summer.\n\nThe Beijing 2008 gold medallist is set to play Olympic doubles for Spain alongside reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nNadal previously discussed the possibility on the Madrid Open's official podcast IGUALES in April, saying: \"I think if we're both fit enough, why not?\n\n\"We could have the chance to form a great team and aspire to great things. It'd be good for both of us. I think it'd also be good for the Spanish team, so we'll see how things progress.\"\n\nAnd Alcaraz, who was in the crowd for his compatriot's defeat to Zverev, confirmed the proposal after his first round French Open victory over J.J Wolf.\n\nHe revealed: \"If everything goes well, we are going to play doubles here.\"\n\nShould the budding partnership produce a positive result, it may well force Nadal to reconsider his earlier suggestion of retirement, having revealed that the decision is not yet set in stone.\n\nThe all-time great admitted: \"I don't know what's going to happen in the next few months. I need to finish all this process.\n\n\"My mindset was ready until Olympics and then I need to check how I feel in different ways in terms of personal motivation, body feelings, and then in terms of level of tennis it makes sense to keep playing.\"", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martha_riley@talksport.com", "name": "Martha Riley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000745603782.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1070, "textEnd": 1076}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

This unexpected defeat has left fans questioning whether the 14-time champion will return to the Grand Slam he has dominated for two decades.\n\nThe 22-time major champion, who first claimed the Musketeers' Cup in 2005 and last lifted the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury disrupted his career, had hinted that this year might be his final one on the tour.\n\nHaving returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting.\n\nVictory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals.\n\nNadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain.\n\nFaced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop.\n\nThe crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak.\n\nWatched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game.\n\nThe boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.\n\n(With inputs from Reuters)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

This coming fortnight could be a truly significant moment, the 14-time champion's final appearance in Paris, and one that could well end with his first-round meeting against Alexander Zverev. In reality, though, not even Nadal has a clue if this is the end.\n\n\"Maybe the last one; maybe not,\" said Nadal, smiling. \"But let's explore. I hope to be clear. I don't want to create a big confusion, but I'm enjoying what I am doing. Sorry, but I am feeling competitive in the practices.\"\n\nNadal had been moved to explain why he could not be 100% certain that this would be his final appearance at the French Open, despite his own comments this year, after a recent awkward moment. After his farewell ceremony at the Madrid Open, Italian Open organisers had planned their own surprise event, but Nadal quickly left the court after his dire loss to Hubert Hurkacz and did not return.\n\nLater, he noted that he wasn't even sure that it would be his last appearance there. The French Tennis Federation may be well served to temper any plans for a grand farewell.\n\nA month ago in Barcelona, Nadal's future seemed grim. The 37-year-old had competed in just one tournament in the prior 15 months and he was still struggling physically in the days before the Madrid Open, unsure if his body would let him perform properly. But since then, he has been able to train and compete for four weeks without any significant physical problems.\n\nWith many hours spent on the court, Nadal has felt himself progressing. He said he is competitive with top players in practice matches and, as of this week, has finally been able to move with freedom. \"In some way I don't want to close 100% the door, because of a very simple thing,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"First thing, I am enjoying playing tennis. Second thing, I am travelling with the family. They are enjoying. I am enjoying sharing all this process with them. And third thing, I was not able to explore yet the proper way how I will be able to play being in more or less healthy conditions again, playing without limitation.\"\n\nIn a perfect world, this is a process that would have happened a few months earlier, allowing Nadal an opportunity to find his feet throughout the clay season before Roland Garros. But time is not on his side and Zverev, the fourth seed, awaits.\n\n\"It's a super tough first round,\" said Nadal. \"Maybe I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that. But in my mind is to do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitively.\"\n\nBeyond Nadal, the men's draw is looking like the most open grand slam tournament in years. While Novak Djokovic, the top seed, is struggling badly with motivation and form, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, seeded second and third, arrived in Paris recovering from injuries. Among the rest of the field, whoever is healthy, bold and ready to produce their best tennis may be rewarded with the tournament of their life.\n\nAfter years of order in men's tennis and unpredictability in women's, their roles have reversed. This year, Iga Swiatek returns to Roland Garros as the overwhelming favourite, seeking her third consecutive French Open title and a fourth in her last five appearances. Swiatek has dominated the clay season, becoming the first player to win the Madrid-Rome double as a four-week format.\n\nIn both finals, Swiatek had to hold off Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 2 and clear second favourite, and their rivalry continues to grow. While the Madrid Open final was an instant classic, decided on a final-set tie-break after Sabalenka missed three match points, Rome was perhaps a better example of how difficult it is to hang with Swiatek in slower clay court conditions.\n\nElena Rybakina, the fourth seed, is clearly another contender after defeating Swiatek in the semi-finals of Stuttgart and narrowly losing a spectacular battle with Sabalenka in Madrid, but she appears to be struggling with her immune system recently as she has been unable to remain healthy. Coco Gauff, seeded third, has found her form in recent weeks but her 1-10 record against Swiatek is a monumental obstacle now she has been drawn in the Pole's half.\n\nBeyond the top four, the Americans Danielle Collins and Madison Keys stand as more peripheral contenders after their brilliant recent performances. Still, while there are numerous players performing at an extremely high level, it remains to be seen if anyone can slow down this era of dominance that Swiatek continues to establish in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tumaini_carayol@theguardian.com", "name": "Tumaini Carayol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danielle Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fd03cd80aa85e7316a0fdf7c7e200fd45f1eafc/0_65_7707_4624/master/7707.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=dd9d94c1f6f39d9bd139bfccbd2b73cf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

That's his wish,\" she continued. \"And even though we were ready to push the button if something happens, we obviously are going to respect what he wants and make sure we are ready whenever he feels he wants to do it.

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0

Despite a premature exit from the French Open, Nadal remains focused on preparing for the Olympic Games. He shares his thoughts on physical setbacks, possible transitions, and his ultimate goal of winning another gold medal.\n\nRafa Nadal likened his struggles with injury in the last 18 months to being in a jungle as the 14-times French Open champion hoped to return to Roland Garros for the Olympic Games after making a premature exit from the Grand Slam on Monday.\n\nNever far from physical issues in his glittering career, the 37-year-old missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major. Nadal crashed to a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev in Paris and although there were positives, he said he could not predict how his battered body would respond to the demands of the Games in July and August.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.\n\nHe had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what is likely his final French Open. \"Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,\" Nadal added.\n\n\"I had my chances... I mean, I wasn't that far. That's my feeling. That's probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. \"Of course disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I'm happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\"\n\nNadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics. \"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay. \"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/15_01_2022_11_18_30_8021152.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\n___\n\nHoward Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.

The drama traces back to the 2022 semi-finals at Roland Garros, where Zverev, then 27, endured a devastating ankle injury three hours into his battle against Nadal.\n\nThis injury sidelined him for the remainder of the year, while Nadal, a decade older, went on to secure his 14th French Open title and a record-breaking 22nd Grand Slam trophy. Zverev stirred controversy when he expressed to Eurosport that it \"could have been the week\" he clinched his first major title, quickly clarifying he didn't mean to come off as arrogant.\n\nThis sparked a cheeky retort from Ivan Ljubicic, ex-world No.3 and Roger Federer's coach for six years, who mocked Zverev's confidence about his prospects in Paris. \"Nobody wants to sound arrogant but everyone is claiming to have almost won Roland Garros last year,\" Ljubicic quipped on social media in 2023, punctuating his comment with a crying-with-laughter emoji and adding, \"Love it! On with trash talk!\"\n\nDespite the setback, Roland Garros remains Zverev's preferred slam, having reached the semi-finals for three consecutive years. His performance at this year's Australian Open, where he made it to the semi-finals, has largely dispelled concerns over any lingering effects from his 2022 injury, reports the Express.\n\nLjubicic didn't hold back in his critique, especially given that Nadal was leading 7-6(8), 6-6 when their match was abruptly stopped. Zverev, who has clinched three wins out of ten against Nadal, has shown commendable resilience after a severe injury, yet he's still chasing his first major title and the world No.1 spot.\n\nOver the past year, Nadal's form has notably dipped, participating in only one Grand Slam in 2023. His early exit in Melbourne was followed by a series of injuries, sparking rumours of an impending retirement. A difficult draw was always on the cards for Nadal - who returned to his stomping ground with a protected ranking - but even Zverev was shocked by the news.\n\n\"I actually thought [my brother] was joking in the beginning,\" Zverev shared with journalists, reflecting on his initial reaction to the draw. \"But then, yeah, it is what it is. I mean, obviously, to be very honest, I wanted to play Rafa again in my career, in his career, because I didn't want my last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court in a wheelchair.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the latter stage of the tournament. It's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes on Monday.\"\n\nZverev is tipped to be the favourite in their upcoming clash, but Nadal will be keen to avoid a first-round exit from the French Open for the first time in his career. The Parisian tournament promises to deliver some thrilling moments in the coming weeks, with this match-up already shaping up to be one of the most exciting openers.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters\n\nFourteen-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal said there was still a chance this year's tournament in Paris may not be his last, in comments ahead of his tough opener against fourth seed Alexander Zverev.\n\nThe Spaniard, who turns 38 next month, skipped last year's tournament due to a hip injury that needed surgery and has said he expects to retire at the end of 2024.\n\nBut he wasn't ready to repeat those words on Saturday.\n\n\"If I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand,\" Nadal told a packed press conference.\n\n\"I don't want to close 100% the door, because it's a very simple thing. First, I'm enjoying playing tennis,\" he said, adding that he was \"more or less healthy .. and playing without limitation\".\n\n\"Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going'. But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one.\"\n\nNadal skipped the Australian Open in January with a muscle problem, and the 22-times Grand Slam champion had raised doubts about his fitness for the year's second major with lingering issues in Barcelona, Madrid and Rome.\n\n\"I'm feeling better. That's the truth. Not because I'm here,\" Nadal added, appearing more cheerful than he has in recent months.\n\n\"Probably because we did things to try to feel better and we have been working without a stop to keep going with the process, to try to arrive here in a proper way.\"\n\nNadal turned his attention to Monday's clash with Zverev, a rematch of the 2022 semi-final when the German retired after an ankle injury.\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal said, referring to a second-round defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian capital this month.\n\n\"But in my mind is something different, play much better and give myself a chance to be competitive... I didn't play this level of opponents, being competitive since a super-long time.\n\n\"So all these questions I understand that you're making to me I'm asking to myself too. But the answer is going to be on Monday, no? That's it.\n\n\"The rest of the things are just talking and talking, and in the end don't matter. It's about my feelings and my feelings are better.

But some solid early results on the surface, allied to his body feeling good, has seen that end date potentially shift.\n\nYesterday's match was the rarity of him being an underdog at a Major where he is a 14-time champion and where he had previously lost just three times in 115 encounters.\n\nEven in defeat, it was clear he was the main draw, the crowd repeatedly chanting his name and Zverev reading the room well enough to answer just one question in his post-court interview before insisting this was Nadal's moment.\n\nRafael Nadal\n\nOf his next steps, Nadal said: \"My feeling is, even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea for right now.

Not because I'm here,\" Nadal added, appearing more cheerful than he has in recent months.\n\n\"Probably because we did things to try to feel better and we have been working without a stop to keep going with the process, to try to arrive here in a proper way.\"\n\nNadal turned his attention to Monday's clash with Zverev, a rematch of the 2022 semi-final when the German retired after an ankle injury.\n\n\"It's a super-tough first round. Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility. I don't want to hide that,\" Nadal said, referring to a second-round defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in the Italian capital this month.\n\n\"But in my mind is something different, play much better and give myself a chance to be competitive... I didn't play this level of opponents, being competitive since a super-long time.\n\n\"So all these questions I understand that you're making to me I'm asking to myself too.

Nadal matched world number four Zverev for long periods on a packed Court Philippe Chatrier, but slipped to a 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 loss as he was beaten for just the fourth time in 116 matches at the tournament. This year's event was expected to be the 14-time champion's farewell to Roland Garros, but he had since insisted he could not confirm \"100 percent\" it would be his last appearance. \"If it is (the last time), then you have been amazing,\" Nadal told an adoring crowd unde place I love the most.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 next week, showed all his trademark fighting qualities in a gripping match, but only managed to convert two of 11 break points against an inspired opponent. \"The first round wasn't ideal,\" he admitted, before saying he \"hoped\" to be back at Roland Garros later this summer for the Paris Olympics. \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\"\n\nGerman Zverev proved too strong despite the fans desperately attempting to raise Nadal to past glories. He banished the memories of the duo's last meeting, when he left Chatrier court on a wheelchair after injuring his ankle during their 2022 French Open semi-final. His reward for becoming just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros -- after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling -- is a match against either David Goffin or home wildcard Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Women's world No 1 Swiatek raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. The Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday. Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks.\n\nThe Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet. Former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1. Women's third seed Coco Gauff raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1. She will face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32. Marketa Vondrousova eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets.

No, I am focused on trying to play well. That's it,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that.\n\n\"But in my mind, is do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitive.\"\n\n- 'Didn't want' to play Nadal -\n\nZverev did not play again in 2022 after that ankle injury but has climbed the rankings again in recent months.\n\nThe 27-year-old has long been touted as a future Grand Slam champion but remains without one of tennis' four biggest titles.\n\nClay is his strongest surface, though, and he has reached the semi-finals in each of the last three years at Roland Garros.\n\nThe men's draw looks far more open than usual, with doubts surrounding Nadal's fitness and Novak Djokovic having endured a turbulent start to the year.\n\n\"I can guarantee you Novak didn't want to play Rafa in the first round and (Carlos) Alcaraz didn't want to play, Jannik (Sinner) didn't want to play him,\" admitted Zverev.\n\n\"I don't want to play him in the first round, but it is how it is.\"\n\n\"I'm really happy to be back. Feel like I'm playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,\" said Swiatek.\n\nThe Italian star struck 33 winners and broke Eubanks' serve five times as he set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet.\n\n\"The hip is good, I'm very happy,\" said Sinner. \"The general shape isn't at 100 percent yet so we're trying to build every day.\"\n\nMarketa Vondrousova, a former Roland Garros runner-up and reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets before rain fell in Paris.\n\nTunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur also booked her place in round two with a 6-3, 6-2 win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9olia_Jeanjean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9olia Jeanjean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachia_Vickery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sachia Vickery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gasquet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Gasquet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeka_Masarova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebeka Masarova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Former champions praise his effort and the possibility of him competing in the Paris Olympics. Nadal's fans were given hope of his return to Roland Garros after he expressed newfound confidence and pain-free play.\n\nRafa Nadal's level of tennis during his French Open defeat by Alexander Zverev on Monday would have earned him victory against the vast majority of players in the draw, according to former Roland Garros champion Mats Wilander. The 37-year-old Spaniard, who missed almost all of 2023 with injuries, went down in straight sets to the fourth-seed German as Zverev became only the third player to beat the 14-time champion on the Parisian clay.\n\nIn what was possibly his last match at the tournament he has dominated for almost two decades, Nadal showed flashes of his former brilliance and has made no secret of targeting a return to Roland Garros for this year's Paris Olympics. He also offered some hope to his legions of fans that he might extend his career a little longer.\n\nWilander said the prospect of him playing at the Olympics was exciting. \"Obviously the Olympics are huge and for him to have the chance to play here on Philippe Chatrier is amazing and could be an unbelievable end to his career,\" Wilander told Eurosport.\n\n\"I think he beats 90% of the draw today. There's only a few guys that would beat him playing this well. And Zverev was the worst opponent possible in the first round, worse than playing (Novak) Djokovic, worse than playing (Carlos) Alcaraz.\" Wilander said the fact the roof on Philippe Chatrier was closed for the match worked against Nadal.\n\n\"The circumstances, it's indoor, cold outside, the ball doesn't travel. So I think all that, and still being so close it's all positive for Rafa and with that passion, why not. He knows how to win big matches on this court,\" the Swede said. Alex Corretja, the former world number two, said he had detected a change in heart from his compatriot Nadal.\n\n\"I spoke to him a couple of months ago and he was sure he wouldn't be back (at the French Open),\" Corretja told Eurosport. \"But then I spoke to him a week ago, and he said to me it's the first time I've been practising here at Roland Garros that I feel no pain. He said he felt so good on the court and that his tennis is growing and doesn't see any reason why he can't come back at least one more time.\n\n\"But he also said, it depends how I play. If I play awful against Zverev, maybe I won't come back. But the way he played, I believe he will think why not come back.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Wilander", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mats Wilander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurosport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurosport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c0lex_Corretja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00c0lex Corretja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/15_01_2022_11_18_30_8021152.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhether or not Rafael Nadal is the GOAT can be debated. However, there is absolutely no doubt that Nadal will always have a special place in the sport for winning a Grand Slam 14 times, a tournament which has never been won by legends like Pete Sampras, Andy Murray, Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg. And as a result of this incredible achievement, the Spaniard collected almost $27 million in prize money.\n\nThese 14 victories at Roland Garros are responsible for the Raging Bull to win nearly 20% of his entire career earnings from just one tournament. The Mallorca native emerged as an elite player on the ATP Tour during the 2005 season.\n\nLifting the French Open 2005 trophy was the most surreal moment for the youngster. With the virtue of defeating Mariano Puerta 6-7, 6-3, 6-1, 7-5, the southpaw took home $1,064,800 (approx.).\n\nNadal made sure that no one could dub his 2005 title win a \"fluke\" by lifting the La Coupe des Mousquetaires for another 3 years in a row. The sum total of the prize money he earned for the 2006, 2007, and 2008 victories was $4,084,400 (approx.).\n\nAfter suffering a shocking loss in 2009, Nadal turned to his winning ways from 2010 onwards. It seemed as if his first loss in Paris in almost five years hurt him deeply, as he would go on to win at the Court Philippe-Chatrier for 5 years on the trot. Winning the Grand Slam from 2010-2014 allowed him to collect $9,434,044 in his kitty.\n\nDue to the several injuries he sustained in 2015 and 2016, Rafa had a dip in his production. However, he managed to silence his naysayers by winning the French Open four times in a row. The 2022 edition was the latest French Open that Nadal won. His earnings in each of those years were - $2,352,414 (2017), $2,592,475 (2018), $2,710,315 (2019), $1,894,332 (2020), and $2,290,354 (2022), as per Perfect Tennis.\n\nRemarkably, Rafael Nadal is the player to have won the most amount of prize money from one tournament. Nadal is easily ahead of Novak Djokovic, who has won the Australian Open 10 times.\n\nThe Spaniard has also earned more than double of what Roger Federer did for winning Wimbledon 8 times. It is astounding more so because the French Open is the lowest-paying out of the 4 Grand Slams in tennis.\n\nRoger Federer won more Wimbledon titles than any other player ever - 8 times. In total, these 8 victories accumulate $11,507,580 in prize money. While the amount is still astronomical, it is worth noting that there is an almost $15 million difference compared to Rafael Nadal's French Open title-winning years' amount.\n\nNovak Djokovic won the Australian Open 10 times - 9 of them being in the 2010s and 2020s - and earned a whopping $22,927,935. Despite the Happy Slam giving the highest prize money out of three events, Djoko's figure is still almost $4 million less than Nadal's above-mentioned amount.\n\nSo even if Rafael Nadal loses his first round match against Alexander Zverev on Monday at the French Open 2024, it is unlikely that Novak Djokovic breaches this all-time Grand Slam money record at the Australian Open. This is because Djokovic will have to win the Grand Slam at least twice Down Under in the coming years.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Sampras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Sampras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Edberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Becker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boris Becker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_(roller_coaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raging Bull (roller coaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe_des_Mousquetaires", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coupe des Mousquetaires"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Puerta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariano Puerta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Contests", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/09/931304e3-untitled-design-65.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-11", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

A tough, expected challenge, which however attracted some criticism towards the tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who would not have protected Rafa from a very tough first round.\n\nTo respond to the criticism, Mauresmo gave an interview to the French newspaper Le Figaro, in which she talked about the men's draw, obviously focusing on the match between Zverev and Nadal and on the other great match in the first round between Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. Amelie explained why Rafael Nadal was not granted top seed status, which would have prevented a challenge against a top player in the first round.\n\n\"We knew that it could happen that we had Nadal against Zverev or Nadal against one of the top players in the world already in the first round. Zverev demonstrated in Rome that he is in excellent form, I imagine that Rafa will not have been happy with the draw, but he is a warrior like no other and knows this court well and the long distance of the five sets there was this semi-final which ended with Zverev's very serious injury,\" she explained.\n\nCriticism has been raised by many for the failure to grant Nadal top seed status. Many fans claimed that an exception could have been made for a 14-time Roland Garros winner.\n\n\"If we could, we would have done it. But protecting him would have solved some problems, but it would have brought many more. Even Wimbledon stopped working like that several years ago. It's sport, everything is possible.

With his current ranking of 275, Nadal faces a future of challenging matches against top-ranked players from the very beginning of tournaments.\n\nThe elite level of competition is among the top 32, making it difficult for anyone ranked lower to progress without significant struggle.\n\nZverev's victory makes him only the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros, following Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic. This was only the second time Nadal lost in his debut match at a major tournament.\n\nThe 15,000 spectators at Philippe Chatrier supported him wholeheartedly. Gone are the days when the crowd was against him, as they were from 2005 to 2008, preferring Roger Federer.\n\nMarc Maury, the tournament's historic announcer, nearly lost his voice recounting all of Nadal's achievements on Parisian soil.\n\nZverev won the first game decisively, exposing Nadal's lack of lateral mobility and struggles with his serve, highlighted by a double fault.\n\nThe heavy ground, a result of rain that forced the match indoors, did not favor Nadal. Despite Zverev's immense talent, his mental fragility remains a concern, despite his 22 titles, including an Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games.\n\nNadal desperately sought to find his rhythm but struggled with his backhand, weakened since his hip surgery.\n\nAfter 13 minutes, he managed to win his first game, which sent the crowd into a frenzy. His supporters, including his father Sebastian, his brothers Miquel Angel, Rafael, and Toni (his mentor), his mother Ana Mar\u00eda, his sister Maribel, and his wife Mery Perello, packed the stands as if it were a final.\n\nNadal's last best-of-five match was in January 2023 against Mackenzie McDonald at the Australian Open, where he ended up injured. Time favored Zverev, who had a chance to close the second set at 2-1 with a break point but failed, allowing Nadal to break his serve and take the lead.\n\nThe second set saw Zverev miss his chance to close, leading to a tiebreak where he eventually prevailed. Only four times in his career had Nadal overcome a two-set deficit, none of which were at nearly 38 years old.\n\nThe last time was at the Australian Open 2022 against Daniil Medvedev, but the miracle did not repeat in Paris.\n\nThe atmosphere resembled a Davis Cup match, with passionate support and tension. A psychological battle ensued as they crossed paths at the net during changeovers, with Nadal insisting on passing last, a ritual his opponent tried to disrupt.\n\nNadal indeed remained competitive and fought valiantly. He saved two break points in the opening game of the third set and briefly led 2-0. However, Zverev's relentless cross-court backhand eventually wore him down.\n\nNadal's last stand saw him fighting for each service game, staying alive until the seventh game of the third set.

A clump of two-dozen that is used to getting choice seats clogged the entryway to the president's box. In the upper reaches of the stadium, they crouched on stairways. In the fancy areas, the luxury suites and club rooms, the bartenders had little to do, their customers too focused on the thing everyone wanted from this day -- the last glimpses of Nadal bull-whipping his forehands, short-hopping volleys off the dirt, and skipping his way into those roof-raising windmill fist-pumps in the court where he had more occasion to do them than anywhere else.\n\nFor more than an hour there wasn't much of any of that, then suddenly there was plenty, a glorious burst of vintage Nadal running around his backhand to blast a forehand and push Zverev deep, perfectly set up for the soft drop shot into the open court. There was an ace down the throat of the court. And here he was, serving at 5-4 to draw even at a set apiece, ready to send the message that he was prepared to \"die on the court,\" as he always put it.\n\nOn Saturday, Nadal had spoken about his biggest concern facing Zverev, the world No. 4 and the the most fit and in-form player at the top of the sport in the first round. He'd been playing well in practice, moving with a freedom he hadn't felt in months, and feeling at moments like he had the level of the best players in the world.\n\nPractice sets, though, are one thing. Making the right decisions and executing the shots under the pressure of a Grand Slam with the eyes of the world watching, knowing the consequences of the slightest misses -- that's something that only comes with the kinds of matches Nadal has not played in nearly two years.\n\nUltimately, that is what doomed him on chilly and dreary afternoon and evening under the roof on Chatrier. In the moments when he'd nearly always found his best tennis and made the right decisions and the most courageous of shots -- when he served to draw even then battled into a do-or-die tiebreaker -- they weren't there.\n\nHe hit serves that became easy chances for Zverev to go on the defensive, and groundstrokes into the middle of the court that Zverev pounded for winners. The big German needed just four points to square up the set at 5-5, then rode his killer serve and jumped on two ill-advised drop shots from Nadal to take a two-set lead and turn the end into a matter of time and details.\n\nWhen Zverev rocketed a backhand service return past a charging Nadal to get the crucial break of serve in the third set, a stadium that had throbbed only minutes before as the Spaniard fought to extend his French Open life just a little longer, fell nearly silent.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_futterman@nytimes.com", "name": "Matthew Futterman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(sports_equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racket (sports equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Chatrier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Chatrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/27122017/Nadal-Chatrier-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

So what can I do? That's the draw. Just try to be ready for it.\"\n\nNadal, who turns 38 in a week's time, has shown flashes of his best form in the clay-court swing, but was thrashed 6-1, 6-3 by Poland's Hubert Hurkacz in the second round of his last outing in Rome.\n\nHe boasts a 7-3 winning record over Zverev ahead of their first meeting since the 2022 French Open semi-finals, when the German left the court in a wheelchair near the end of the second set after injuring his ankle.\n\n\"I am not anxious. No, I am focused on trying to play well. That's it,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"Maybe I go there and I repeat the disaster of Rome. It's a possibility, of course. I don't want to hide that.\n\n\"But in my mind, is do something different and play much better and give myself a chance to play competitive.\"\n\nZverev did not play again in 2022 after that ankle injury but has climbed the rankings again in recent months.\n\nThe 27-year-old has long been touted as a future Grand Slam champion but remains without one of tennis' four biggest titles.\n\nClay is his strongest surface, though, and he has reached the semi-finals in each of the last three years at Roland Garros.\n\nThe men's draw looks far more open than usual, with doubts surrounding Nadal's fitness and Novak Djokovic having endured a turbulent start to the year.\n\n\"I can guarantee you Novak didn't want to play Rafa in the first round and (Carlos) Alcaraz didn't want to play, Jannik (Sinner) didn't want to play him,\" admitted Zverev.\n\n\"I don't want to play him in the first round, but it is how it is. He has been out injured. He hasn't played a lot of tennis. His ranking is where it is. Of course it's not ideal, but at the same time, you know, there is nothing you can do.\n\n\"Everybody now is excited for a tough battle and tough first round. I think he's excited and I'm excited for it.\"\n\nFrench Open organisers were prepared to stage a tribute ceremony to Nadal to honour his career but the Spaniard was reluctant to endorse such a celebration.\n\n\"We were ready to press the button on it,\" admitted tournament director Amelie Mauresmo.\n\n\"But it's Rafa who manages his timing, we follow what he wants. We wouldn't want to put him in an uncomfortable position.\"\n\n(With inputs from AFP)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

Preparing for just his fifth tournament of the year, the 14-time champion has made noticeable physical progress, even since competing in Rome two weeks ago.\n\n\"I am improving in different ways. I have less limitations than three, four weeks ago, without a doubt,\" Nadal said in Saturday's press conference. \"I am having a good week of practices. I probably will say this is the first week since I came back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations. That encourages me.\n\n\"In the practices, without a doubt I improved. Especially in terms of movements. So I don't feel the limitations that I felt in Rome in terms of running to both sides, so that's a lot for me.\"\n\nThis fortnight is likely to be Nadal's final showing at the season's second major, where he boasts an unrivalled 112-3 match record across 18 appearances. But save the emotional farewell for another day: the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings cited three important reasons why he continues to relish each moment on Tour.\n\n\"In some way I don't want to close the door 100 per cent, because of a very simple thing,\" Nadal said. \"First thing, I am enjoying playing tennis. Second thing, I am travelling with [my] family. They are enjoying it. I am enjoying sharing all this process with them. And third thing, I was not able to explore yet the proper way of how I will be able to play being in more or less healthy conditions, playing without limitation.\"\n\nWhile Nadal enters Paris in his best physical shape this clay season, luck drew him no favours to begin the tournament. The 22-time major titlist faces fourth seed and Rome champion Alexander Zverev in a blockbuster first-round match. Nadal learned of his place in the draw while indulging in a Spanish board game.\n\n\"I was playing some Parchis and at some point somebody told me the draw. Something that I expected in some way, no? When you are not seeded, anything can happen,\" Nadal said. \"I play against one of the toughest opponents possible, and at the same time, he came here winning the last event and it's a Masters 1000. It's not a small one.\"\n\nNo matter his place in the field of 128, Nadal is glad to be healthy and able to compete at the tournament he has dominated the past two decades.\n\n\"I am grateful that I am able to be in Roland Garros and give myself a chance to play at least one more time here. Maybe the last one, maybe not,\" he said with a laugh. \"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros, but if I have to tell you it's 100 per cent my last Roland Garros, sorry, but I will not because I cannot predict what's going on.\"", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/25/13/20/nadal-roland-garros-2024-practice.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The match, lasting 3 hours and 5 minutes, marked Nadal's third-ever loss at the French Open.\n\nThe match began with a shaky start for Nadal, as Zverev quickly seized an early lead by breaking Nadal's serve.\n\nDespite Nadal's attempts to stage a comeback, Zverev maintained control and clinched the first set 6-3.\n\nNadal fought fiercely in the second set, rallying to even the score at 2-2 and thrilling the spectators with his resilience. However, Zverev's powerful serving and strategic gameplay ultimately prevailed, as he secured the second set in a tie-breaker.\n\nUndeterred, Nadal made a spirited effort in the third set, taking an early lead and captivating the spectators with his exceptional play. However, Zverev's consistency and composure proved decisive as he broke Nadal's serve and sealed the match with a 6-3 victory in the third set.\n\nZverev's triumph marked a significant upset in the tournament, ending Nadal's campaign in the first round and sending shockwaves through the tennis world. Despite the defeat, Nadal received a warm ovation from both Zverev and the crowd, acknowledging his enduring legacy at Roland Garros.

Wimbledon gets underway on July 1, with the Olympic tennis tournament starting less than a month later on July 27.\n\n\"It looks difficult,\" Nadal, who won singles gold at Beijing 2008, said of his Wimbledon prospects. \"Honestly, I can't confirm what's going on, but for me, now it looks difficult to make the transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay.\n\n\"So I cannot confirm anything, I need to talk with the team, I need to analyze so many facts, but I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today, I feel that's not a good idea. I can't confirm, but my feeling is, even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\"\n\nNadal is also set to play in the doubles at Paris 2024 with Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nThe 37-year-old has struggled with injury since the 2023 Australian Open and was forced to miss the vast majority of last season as he tried to get his body ready for one last year on tour.\n\nAfter previously announcing that 2024 would likely be his last year in professional tennis, Nadal opened the door to a possible return in 2025 after his defeat to Zverev, saying he is \"not 100% sure\" the loss was his final appearance at Roland Garros.\n\nBut given his injury struggles over the last 18 months, Nadal admitted that, even if prioritizes being fit for the Olympics, there is no guarantee he will be.\n\n\"I cannot tell you if I will be or won't be in one month and a half,\" Nadal said. \"My body has been a jungle for two years and you don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me; another day, a tiger.\n\n\"It's been a big fight with all of the things I went through, but the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready.

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0

That has encouraged me,\" said Nadal, who arrived for his pre-championship media interaction in an electric blue tee and a smile to match. \"That does not mean that I'm going to play incredible on Monday, no?\"\n\nThe 22-time major winner, who has a glittering 112-3 win-loss record here, retraced his romance at this spectacularly stylish venue.\n\n\"In some ways this place is magical for me,\" he said. \"So, if, in the bottom of my heart, I don't have any hope to have success here and to create a beautiful thing this year, I will not be here in front of you guys.\"\n\nThat declaration at once lifted the mood in the packed-to-capacity press room. Nobody wants one of the greatest champions this game has seen, one of the fiercest fighters in all sport, limp into the sunset. That would be a travesty.\n\nNadal, who went down to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round in Rome in his last tournament outing, indicated that he's able to push more physically.\n\n\"I don't feel the limitations that I felt in Rome in terms of running,\" he said. \"I'm not thinking in terms of having amazing results here but thinking about giving myself a little bit more room to think about what can happen in the future.\"\n\nThis then, particularly the last three-four months, has got to be Nadal's weightiest fight, chasing as he is a wafer-thin chance on the slippery slope of hope. Battling age and wrestling for time.\n\n\"We did things to try to feel better, and we have been working without a stop to keep progressing, to try to arrive here in a proper way,\" he said.\n\nEach time Nadal threads the needle with his m\u00e9lange of heavily spun groundies on a practice court, he's faced with questions.\n\n\"I didn't play five-set matches since a long time. I haven't played this level of opponents since a long time,\" he said. \"All these questions that you ask me, I'm asking to myself too.\"\n\nZverev, more than a decade younger than his opponent, is up to speed having claimed his biggest title in two years ago in Rome last week\n\nThe German is looking to finish a match he couldn't two years ago when he was wheeled off the court in the middle of their sea-saw semifinal with an ankle injury.\n\n\"I wanted to play Rafa again, because I didn't want the last memory of me playing against Rafa to be me leaving the court on a wheelchair,' the 27-year-old said. \"For me, in my mind, I'm going to play peak Rafa Nadal. I expect him to be at his absolute best. I expect him to play the best tennis he's played in a long time.\"\n\nBring out the popcorn, if only because there's hope yet.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "prajwal_hegde@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Prajwal Hegde", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burlesque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popcorn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-110426173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50382,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\n\n'I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 was a tough moment for you so you deserve it.\n\n'I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here.\n\n'The first round wasn't ideal. I was competitive and I had chances but it was difficult against a player as good as Sasha.\n\n'It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n'Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared.\n\n'The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn't think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process. All the people who are in Roland Garros helping me since I came here and the support of my people.\n\n'I can't thank them all enough. The feelings you made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.

He fights with Grosjean due to the helplessness of the local public, chauvinistic until then: the Parisians had not yet learned to love the Manacor\u00ed. And he passes over Ferrer and over Federer himself before knocking down Mariano Puerta in the final.\n\n19 years later, the chronicler continues jogging through the Bois de Boulogne, but the pace of the race is no longer enough and he does not have long hair either, but rather a shaved skull and a snowy beard.\n\nAnd yet, he acts as if nothing had happened: at noon he looks out at Roland Garros, as excited as he is deluded, and prepares to enjoy this sudden Nadalmania, the wave that has taken over Paris these days.\n\nDreamer?\n\nNadalmania seems to subside three minutes into the match.\n\nThis is the time that Sasha Zverev (27) spends breaking the serve of Rafael Nadal, ten years older than the German.\n\nA drop shot that does not bear fruit, a ball that goes long, a double fault and a bomb from the giant who sports a ponytail mark the painful fate of the long-awaited return, Nadal's return to his promised land: three hours later, Paris bids farewell to his favorite son (6-3, 7-6 (5) and 6-3).\n\n15,000 spectators bundled up in their jackets (including Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz) and Nadal's sculpture, lying a few meters away, mute and undaunted in the Parisian rain, contemplate the decline of the myth, a 37-year-old autumnal icon whose presentation has never been just:\n\n-Two thousand seven... -speaks the presenter in the proleg\u00f3menos, and sigue contando-: two thousand eight (...), two thousand twelve (...), two thousand twenty-two!\n\nNadal has won so many times in Paris: fourteen editions.\n\n(No one will repeat such a feat, it doesn't hurt to remember it).\n\nRoland Garros had never sold out in the first week. Nadal had never left Paris in the first week. And yet, the man, the myth, sticks to his guns: he tunes up the court, distributes the four towels in the four planters, places the bottles diagonally, never steps on a line as he advances towards his position, sweeps the lines with the inside of his right foot, he wipes away the sweat with his right wristband, he fixes the fold of his pants.\n\nWe will miss him, or perhaps not yet, because the man from Manaco is moving forward, he does not close doors to the future, he thinks he could return to Paris in a year, although here and now he does not seem to have any options against Zverev.\n\nLate in the first set, the chronicler observes deficiencies in the serve (Nadal serves at 175 km/h), lack of depth on the forehand and little repris in his legs: when he gets tired, he cuts the point with a drop shot. He often gets it wrong. Nadal is weighed down by the year and a half of pain and worries, abdominal problems and inactivity.\n\nOn top of that, he has faced the worst of adversaries.\n\n(This is the life of a tennis player when he appears in a Grand Slam like the 275th on the circuit).\n\nZverev is the fourth tennis player in the world but he could be the first, and he is on fire, victorious in Rome and eager for revenge.\n\nIt is also drizzling and the organizers have deployed the retractable roof of the Philippe Chatrier and Nadal and Zverev have been engaged in an infinite match for three hours. The second set had not even closed when the German stumbled on the clay and, gigantically, collapsed, shouting and crying.\n\nHe broke his ankle.\n\nClear path for the Manacor\u00ed, who is projected towards the final against Ruud and, from there, towards his 14th crown in Paris.\n\nIn the present, Zverev has forgotten about that painful episode and now serves at 205 km/h and endures and overcomes Nadal's rallies and accelerates when he considers it necessary. He needs fifty minutes to take over the first set.\n\nThen, the future seems yours.\n\nEspecially, two hours into the match, when the tie break of the second round is set, the one that Nadal fights to the fullest: the power of his serve has risen to 185 km/h, his forehand goes further, he has He managed to break Zverev's serve, even serving to win the set, but he got stuck and ended up compromising.\n\nFor a few moments, timid glimpses of Nadalidad have been illuminated, the same ones that reappear in the third set, again Nadal breaks Zverev's serve, again Zverev returns it.\n\nThe German gives no respite, involved in a hitting and knocking exercise that ruins the illusions of a legend.\n\n-See you soon -despide Roland Garros to Nadal.\n\nSee you soon, because no one knows anything anymore, no one knows what the manacor\u00ed will be doing in a year, nor does he himself know.\n\n-The truth is that I don't know what to say. Today is Rafa's moment -says Zverev.\n\n-It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if this is the last time I play here. Yes I know I enjoyed it. The chances of him returning are low, but they exist. I hope to be here at the Olympic Games - says Nadal.\n\n(He leaves as quickly as he had done in Barcelona and Rome: the farewell tribute is denied, how can we see goodbye here?).", "source": {"uri":

However, he struggled to find a way beyond his opponent - who secured a 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 success - despite a battling display.\n\nZverev will now play David Goffin or Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard for a spot in the third round. Meanwhile, Nadal was left to bid an emotional farewell to Roland-Garros but refused to confirm whether it was his last appearance at the French Open.\n\nSpeaking after his defeat, the 37-year-old said: \"It is difficult for me to talk, I don't know if it's the last time I'll be here in front of all of you. Honestly, I am not sure. If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have to congratulate Sasha for this great match. I really wish you all the best in this tournament. 2022 was a tough moment for you so you deserve it.\n\n\"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went all through these processes with the dream to be back here. The first round wasn't ideal. I was competitive and I had chances but it was difficult against a player as good as Sasha.\n\n\"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet. I hope to be back here for the Olympics, that motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared.\n\nWhat is your Rafael Nadal highlight? Share your suggestions in the comments below\n\n\"The amount of feelings I had on this court throughout my career, I didn't think I would be here almost 38 with all of the success. It has been a very beautiful process. All the people who are in Roland Garros helping me since I came here and the support of my people.\n\n\"I can't thank them all enough. The feelings you made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I hope to see you again, but I don't know.\"\n\nDespite his win, Zverev also made sure to pay credit to his legendary opponent, who looks set to bow out this year after amassing an eye-watering 14 victories at Roland Garros. He said: \"I don't know what to say. Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world.\n\n\"It is such a great honour. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa's moment.

I am improving in different ways. I have less limitations that three, four weeks ago, without a doubt.

At 37, the Spaniard has an illustrious career in tennis to look back at, as he moves closer to retirement which seems imminent, considering his injuries.\n\nEven as Alexander Zverev claimed a straight sets victory over the Spaniard, hearts went out to Nadal who, might as well, played his last match of the Grand Slam ever.\n\n\"It's going to be the last time I'm here in front of all of you. I'm not 100% sure, but if it was the last time, then I must say I enjoyed it. The feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words. For me, it was special to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most,\" said Nadal while addressing the spectators in the stadium.\n\n\"I have gone through very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through that recovery process only to be back at Roland Garros. To leave after the first round was not an ideal return. But I have to accept it. I was competitive and I had my chances. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha (Alexander Zverev),\" he averred.\n\nHe did give the spectators something to cheer for while mentioning a possible return to Court Philippe-Chatrier for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"What you all have made me feel here, it's unforgettable.

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national

Wimbledon gets underway on July 1, with the Olympic tennis tournament starting less than a month later on July 27.\n\n\"It looks difficult,\" Nadal, who won singles gold at Beijing 2008, said of his Wimbledon prospects. \"Honestly, I can't confirm what's going on, but for me, now it looks difficult to make the transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay.\n\n\"So I cannot confirm anything, I need to talk with the team, I need to analyze so many facts, but I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay.\n\n\"Today, I feel that's not a good idea.

I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me; another day, a tiger.\n\n\"It's been a big fight with all of the things I went through, but the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I will be ready to play again if I had to - but I will not have to,\" he laughed. \"I need to clear my ideas now and see what the new calendar is for me to be ready for the Olympics.\n\n\"I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics that are going to be here, so I need to prepare myself the proper way: to try to arrive here healthy and well prepared - and then let's see.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nNadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio.\n\nHe had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what is likely his final French Open.\n\n\"Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,\" Nadal added.\n\n\"I had my chances... I mean, I wasn't that far. That's my feeling. That's probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that.\n\n\"Of course disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I'm happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.\"\n\nNadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\n\n\"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm.

Tumaini Carayol", "body": "Despite his physical ailments, the Spaniard, 38 in June, feels he is making progress and is pushing for an Olympic appearance in Paris\n\nShortly after his first ever opening-round defeat on Court-Philippe Chatrier, Rafael Nadal arrived at the press conference room for his postmortem in a jovial mood. After a career of dominance at Roland Garros, where he has so often been untouchable even against some of the greatest ever players, he would have been forgiven for feeling a sense of injustice and frustration with a straight-sets loss in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Instead, he felt progress: \"I was not that far,\" he said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nNadal's demeanour further underlined what has been increasingly clear over the last few weeks. If this really is the end and retirement is imminent, it will be because his body made the decision, not his mind. It seems clear that the player who turns 38 next week would love to further elongate his career and he is determined to do everything possible to try.\n\nA month ago, Nadal returned to competition in Barcelona and Madrid still unsure about whether he would even make it to Roland Garros. He had good reason to doubt. After the countless physical issues he has suffered, from hip surgery to complications and many unrelated injuries, his ambitions were low. He simply wanted to be sure that his body could physically withstand the load of competing at the highest level across the best of five sets.\n\nBy those parameters, Nadal's presence at Roland Garros was actually a step forward. He made it back to the most important court of his career performing at a decent level, he made life uncomfortable for one of the tournament favourites and he departed still feeling in good physical shape. Nadal felt he could have beaten many other players in this year's field, and a better draw would have allowed him the opportunity to build his form round by round. Roland Garros came too late in his recovery and he was handed a nightmare draw, but it was far easier to accept than being out of the game without a hope of making progress.\n\n\"I cannot tell you if I will be or not will be [ready] in one month and a half, because my body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal said, smiling. \"[It] has been a big fight with all the things that I went through, no? But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I will be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\"\n\nOn the court, being able to train consistently for five weeks has allowed Nadal to gradually improve, and to eventually reach the point where he was able to train without limitations this week for the first time in 15 months. He has also been travelling with his entire family, including his parents, wife and, for the first time, his son. After such a difficult period, he has been able to return to the familiar lifestyle of a tennis player, a sensation that has been energising.\n\nThis has been a fascinating period for farewells and the varying motivations of players late in their careers. Last week, Dominic Thiem, who faced Nadal in consecutive French Open finals in 2018 and 2019, affirmatively contested his final French Open at 30 years old, losing in the qualifying draw. After injuries and burnout, it was unusual and interesting to hear Thiem describe his decision to retire in logical and rational terms. He argued that continuing into his late-30s, like Nadal and his rivals, is still abnormal. \"I had a very intense career,\" said Thiem. \"I don't really feel like I'm 30 or 31, I feel tennis-wise a bit older, to be honest, so that was very intense.\"\n\nDespite his long list of injuries and ailments, Nadal does not appear to have reached that point. He is still determined to commit himself to the work ahead, to push himself to see how far he can go. The looming question over the coming months will be whether his body ultimately scuppers those ambitions. Limiting the risk of injury will also likely mean no Wimbledon. After his recent struggles, the prospect of switching from clay to grass and then back to clay in time for the Olympics in late July is too risky for him to compete on grass.\n\n\"I need to give myself a little bit longer chances to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision,\" said Nadal. \"But give me two months till Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say: 'Okay, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tumaini_carayol@theguardian.com", "name": "Tumaini Carayol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Thiem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Thiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31cec038b2d7e3ffe9f90dd6939b20adcbad18a9/216_316_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=3713b1615b6ea5240276989f526ae08e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

He joked. He sounded upbeat. He's been playing well and feeling better in practice. He is eager to get going at Roland Garros after dealing for so long with hip and abdominal problems.\n\nOh, and then there's this little tidbit he dropped during a pre-tournament news conference Saturday: This French Open might not turn out to be the 14-time champion's last appearance at his favourite event, after all.\n\nAlso Read | What Happens if KKR vs SRH IPL 2024 Final Match Is Washed Out Due to Rain in Chennai? Is There Any Reserve Day?.\n\nBecause of his age -- he turns 38 on June 3 -- and his injuries and his past statements about figuring 2024 would be his last year on tour, everyone from other players to fans to the media has been assuming it will be his farewell appearance at the French Open.\n\nAsked whether that was accurate, Nadal smiled and replied: \"Don't assume that.\"\n\nAlso Read | KKR vs SRH Head-to-Head Record: Ahead of IPL 2024 Final Clash, Here Are Match Results of Last 3 Kolkata Knight Riders vs Sunrisers Hyderabad Encounters!.\n\n\"It's a big, big chance that it's going to be my last Roland Garros,\" Nadal said. \"But, if I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros? Sorry, but I will not. Because I cannot predict what's going on.\"\n\nThe Spaniard, who turns 38 on June 3, missed much of the last two seasons because of health problems, including hip surgery that forced him to sit out the French Open a year ago, his first absence there since he made his debut as a teenager. He is just 7-4 in 2024, and there had been some doubt after a lopsided loss at the Italian Open two weeks ago whether he would even enter the clay-court tournament in Paris at all.\n\nBut, he did show up and has been training in front of loud crowds this week. Because his ranking is so low after such little activity -- once No. 1, he was No. 276 this week -- Nadal did not get the benefit of a seeding and was drawn to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in a showdown that will be the focus on Monday, Day 2 of the tournament.\n\n\"Ideally, I would have liked to play him in the later stage of the tournament, but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year. I am seeded,\" Zverev said. \"You know, it's a tough draw, but it's a tough draw for both of us. We'll see how it goes.\"\n\nNadal said he has been practising well and feels as if he can play with anyone now, a sensation that has been fleeting for a while.\n\n\"I probably will say is the first week since I come back playing tennis that I am able to run the proper way without having a lot of limitations,\" he said. \"That encourages me.\" (AP)\n\n(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunrisers Hyderabad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Knight_Riders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata Knight Riders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/default-img-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 607, "textEnd": 613, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

But whether that is the last match he will ever play at the French Open, he is not sure. He plans to be back at the Roland Garros stadium in a couple of months for the Olympics but competing again for the Coupe des Mousquetaires? Probably not. But then again...\n\nAs the draw was announced last Thursday, no one could quite believe that the 14-time champion had been pitted against the world No.4. Of course, Nadal was unseeded - two years spent trying to recover from a serious hip injury has seen his ranking plummet to No.275 - but he could have drawn someone infinitely more beatable. But no. The fates would not have it.\n\nDown in the press room's Brit Alley, the gentleman from the Daily Mail asked: \"can we say there were audible gasps?\" We all nodded. Yes, audible gasps were definitely heard when the draw was published. It made for a headline and a decent intro. But as the news sank in, there was a general feeling of doom. If this was to be Nadal's last match, no one wanted to see him take an absolute pasting from a younger, fitter man. He deserved better than that.\n\nBut then Rafa skipped into the interview room to discuss his situation and his chances. And he was very upbeat: his practice week in Paris had been the best he had felt in two years. He was practising well with everyone and holding his own. He felt he was moving better than he had just the week before. He was having fun travelling with his wife and young son. Life was looking up.\n\nWe listened. We were still doom laden. We thought he was whistling in the dark. And then we saw him play Zverev.\n\nTo get to the nuts and bolts of the match: Nadal started tentatively - he was broken in the opening game - but then he started to play. As the match moved into the second set, there were times when he looked like the real Rafa - the forehand down the line, the baseline belter of a backhand, the serve out wide to set up the deft volley (his volleying is an often-overlooked weapon in his armoury), the stunning winner and the cry of \"Vamos!\" and there were even a couple of aces.\n\nHe served for the second set but was broken to love; he saved break points at the start of the third set and then broke for a 2-0 lead. He was broken back. Broken again to go 4-3 down, he had two chances to break another time but he could not take them; Zverev was not going to let him. And that was that.\n\nThen again, Zverev came to Paris as the champion of Rome and with 13 competitive, clay court matches behind him. Nadal came here with just 11 competitive matches on any surface since the start of the year (only two were on clay). To be fair to Zverev, he played well: he did not let the occasion and the crowd get to him - everyone apart from his team was supporting Nadal - and he stuck to his game plan from start to finish.\n\nZverev was also very gracious at the end. When asked about his win, he looked closer to tears than Nadal and thanked the great champion \"from all of the tennis world\". It was, he said, a great honour to play him but \"this is not my moment; it's Rafa's moment. Let him speak.\" On the second day of the French Open, Zverev did exceedingly well on the court and off it.\n\nAs for Nadal, he was both encouraged by what he had done and, at the same time, disappointed...\n\n\"I went on court with the strange feeling that I'm going to be playing first round in Roland-Garros and I will not be favourite, and that's the true,\" he said.\n\n\"But I went on court with the idea to fight for the match, to put the level, the energy there, and just hope that the opponent don't play at his best, because always first round is tough. I played for moments at, I think, a very good level but in other moments I missed.\n\n\"But that's something that is 100 per cent normal when you are not playing tournaments in a row, when you are not playing these kind of matches since almost two years. It's normal that your level is not [consistently high] because in the end you need to practice this, and the only way to practice this is competing.\"\n\nHis final thoughts were that \"I was not that far; that's my feeling\" and that was better than he could have hoped for a couple of weeks ago. He is making no promises about the future but \"the dynamic is positive the last few weeks\".\n\nThe plan is to let the dust settle on his French Open, clear his head and then see where he is. The only part of his future plans coming into immediate focus is Wimbledon - and that is highly unlikely to be on his agenda. With the progress he has made on clay, the idea of switching to grass and then back to clay for the Olympics does not sound wise. \"I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm,\" he said.\n\nBut coming back here next year?

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!

It is difficult for me to talk. Honestly I don't know if it will be the last time before you all,\" the 14-time champion said.\n\n\"It is a big percentage I will not be back, but the body is feeling a bit better and I having fun.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I will say enough (and retire), but I hope to be back on this court in two months for the Olympics. That motivates me.\"\n\nHaving only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going -- and to target more gold.\n\nNadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016.\n\nThat this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him.\n\nHowever, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed.\n\nHe has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years -- in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal.\n\n\"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, (but) I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\"\n\nNadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nLonger term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun.\n\nAnd even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself,\" Nadal said.", "source": {"uri": "7news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "7NEWS.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-14816427/86f6e5f822ef1db8f258267a2c3c708e97221e05-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

On the women's side, Iga Swiatek has been looking unstoppable, but can she close the deal? We asked our experts to weigh in.\n\nWho will win the men's singles title?\n\nPam Shriver: Rafa Nadal. I am picking the 14-time champion because for one more time I can pick the greatest clay-court player in history, and because there are too many question marks surrounding the real favorites on the men's side. Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Djokovic all have too many questions to feel comfortable picking any of them.\n\nDo I really think Nadal can win his 15th Roland Garros title? No, but Nadal for 20 years has done countless things I thought not possible. Even with an impossibly hard first-round match versus Alexander Zverev, I still have to write in Nadal's name one more time as my winner. Nadal's first-round opponent is probably your real favorite on paper, before the draw starts.\n\nBrad Gilbert: Feels like the men's field, for the first time in 20 years, is very open, and it's extremely difficult to pick a winner, whereas in past years, Nadal has absolutely dominated. Djokovic hasn't won a tournament in 2024 so far and would normally be the overwhelming favorite at every Slam. Add in the injury concerns for Sinner and Alcaraz, who are hopefully both healthy now.\n\nThe fact that Nadal is unseeded is wild, as is the fact that he is playing Zverev in the first round. I think it will be two tournaments: The first week, we'll see how many top seeds get through, and then a second-week tournament from there. There might be good opportunities for Stefanos Tsitsipas, Casper Ruud and Zverev if he gets through Nadal. I could easily see something very unpredictable happening 17 days from now.\n\nBill Connelly: If you're Zverev, Tsitsipas, Ruud or Holger Rune, or anyone else hoping that the top tier slips up at some point and gives you a shot at an actual Slam title, your odds might be as good right now as they've been in quite a while (or will be moving forward). Now's your chance.\n\nI'm not picking any of those guys, however. If Sinner hadn't hurt his hip, I'd have kept riding that wave. Instead, I'll give this Djokovic guy a shot. I hear he's pretty good in best-of-five matches.\n\nTom Hamilton: This has to be the most open field in a while. Sinner comes into this recovering from his hip injury, Nadal could yet roll back the stone, Djokovic could end up sweeping the field, and then there's Alcaraz, who's recovering from an arm injury. And don't discount the others like Zverev, Andrey Rublev, Rune and Ruud. So having comfortably sat on the fence, I'm going to go with Alcaraz -- if he's fit. If he's not 100%, then I think Djokovic has a brilliant chance, but it could be Ruud's turn as well, in his third attempt here.\n\nD'Arcy Maine: I don't think I've ever had such a tough time predicting a men's champion at a major. There are so many contenders -- and perhaps even more questions about almost all of them. Before the draw came out, I thought Sinner had a decent chance, assuming his hip was at, or near, 100%, but his path to the final might be too much coming off that injury.\n\nSo, I'm instead going to pick Ruud, who has reached the Roland Garros final the past two years. He won the title in Barcelona this year and reached the final in Monte Carlo. He would need to get past Djokovic in the quarters, but he beat him in Monte Carlo for the first time in six tries and now knows he can.\n\nWho will win the women's singles title?\n\nShriver: Swiatek will win her fourth Roland Garros. She is already starting to be compared to Nadal in terms of success in Paris, and given Swiatek won both Madrid and Rome, she is the obvious pick to win her fifth major. Swiatek's idol is Nadal, therefore it's satisfying to pick them both one more time.\n\nConnelly: ESPN BET has Swiatek listed as the betting favorite over the rest of the field combined. If she wins, she'll have as many French Open titles at age 23 as Nadal, aka the greatest clay-courter ever. How on earth are you supposed to pick against that? I can't, anyway.\n\nHamilton: We're in the passing of the baton stage -- from one dominant force in Nadal to the next clay-court champion: Swiatek. As stunning as the Madrid final was, the Rome final was ominous as to how good Swiatek can be. We're starting to see a wonderful rivalry shaping up here between her and Aryna Sabalenka, but Swiatek cuts differently on clay. She finds her zone on this surface, blocking out any distractions and just clocks into a higher gear.\n\nHer opponents will hope someone finds an Elena Rybakina-type performance, similar to when she overcame Swiatek in the semifinals at Stuttgart, but let's face it, Swiatek is the player to beat.\n\nMaine: Swiatek. She had already proved she was the best in the world on clay, but she has separated herself even further this season from the rest of the field. She overcame a very tricky test against Sabalenka in the exceptional Madrid final and then absolutely dismantled the world No. 2 in the Rome final two weeks later. Barring injury, I don't see anyone beating Swiatek -- who seems to get more and more confident with every match she wins -- at Roland Garros this year.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jannik_Sinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jannik Sinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Shriver", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pam Shriver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Rune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holger Rune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Rublev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Rublev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefanos_Tsitsipas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefanos Tsitsipas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casper_Ruud", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casper Ruud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monte Carlo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0525%2Fr1337668_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Ever since the Spaniard won his first Grand Slam at Roland Garris in 2005, he has been one of the players to watch out at the biggest stage every year.\n\nWhen it comes to number of matches at Majors, Nadal has played 357 of them and won 314 times. Many a times, he has come back from really dire situations to end up on the winning side. Three of those happened when he was on the verge of elimination after losing the first two sets.\n\nREAD | How many five-set matches has Rafael Nadal played at French Open?\n\nHere are the three instances when Nadal came from two-sets-to-love down to win a Grand Slam match:-\n\nWimbledon 2006, Round of 64 - Rafael Nadal beat USA's Robert Kendrick 6-7(4), 3-6, 7-6(2), 7-5, 6-4 Nadal in action against USA's Robert Kendrick during Wimbledon Tennis Championships on June 29, 2006. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nNadal in action against USA's Robert Kendrick during Wimbledon Tennis Championships on June 29, 2006. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nThe first time Nadal lost the opening two sets in a Grand Slam match was against USA's Robert Kendrick in the second round of Wimbledon in 2006. World No. 237 Kendrick was on his way to defeating then then World No. 2 Nadal after leading 7-6(4), 6-3 but the Spaniard clinched the third set in the tiebreak and completed the comeback by winning the next two 7-5 and 6-4. Nadal eventually lost to Roger Federer in the final of that edition.\n\nWimbledon 2007, Round of 16 - Rafael Nadal beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 Nadal returns the ball to Russian Mikhail Youzhny during the 4th round at Wimbledon on July 5, 2007. | Photo Credit: ADRIAN DENNIS\n\nNadal returns the ball to Russian Mikhail Youzhny during the 4th round at Wimbledon on July 5, 2007. | Photo Credit: ADRIAN DENNIS\n\nA year after a scare against Kendrick, Nadal again trailed by two-sets-to-love at the grass Major - this time against Russia's Mikhail Youzhny, the then World No. 13, in the fourth round. However, unlike the match against the American, Nadal won the final three sets fairly easily. Like 2006, Nadal yet again lost to Federer in the summit clash.\n\nAustralian Open 2022, Final - Rafael Nadal beat Russia's Daniil Medvedev 2-6, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-4, 7-5\n\nNadal's third and most recent comeback from two-sets-to-love down came in the final of the Australian Open in 2022. The Spaniard, who had sat out the second half of the previous season with a foot injury, went on an incredible run to reach the summit clash in Melbourne. It was turning out to be anything but a fairytale when he lost the opening two sets against Daniil Medvedev. He even fell 0-40 down while serving at 2-3 in the third set.\n\nHowever, the Spaniard fought back incredibly to take the third and fourth sets with an identical score of 6-4. Nadal served for the title at 5-4 in the fifth but the Russian broke back. Nadal recovered from that blip and restored his advantage by breaking Medvedev in the very next game and this time, served for the title successfully.\n\nLatest on SportstarHow many Grand Slam matches has Rafael Nadal won from two-sets-to-love down?Team SportstarFIFA World Cup winner Karembeu loses two relatives to New Caledonia riots APPremier League: Chelsea leading race to sign Leicester City' Enzo Maresca as new managerTeam SportstarSweden midfielder Kristoffer Olsson still hoping to play football again after acute brain condition APIPL 2024: Dinesh Karthik retires;

He turns 38 in a week and has been dealing with injuries for quite some time.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Nadal acknowledged, \"what's going to happen in the next few months.\"\n\nHe probably won't be back at the tournament where he's collected a record 14 trophies, but write that in pencil, because he would not completely rule out the possibility in the days leading up to, or the moments immediately following, the 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 loss to Alexander Zverev at Roland Garros on Monday that gave the Spaniard the first losing streak of his career on clay courts.\n\nHe probably won't enter Wimbledon, because it just doesn't seem like a good idea to switch to grass right now, although he would not completely rule that out, either.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He probably will be there, but -- hey, here's a twist -- he wouldn't completely commit to that.\n\nSo in sum, all we really know about what the future holds for Nadal is that we don't really know a thing about what the future holds for him. Which, of course, is OK, because he is allowed to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, however he wants.\n\n\"Obviously,\" Zverev observed, \"there are uncertainties.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old child, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap at Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. \"In terms of what's driving me ... I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life, too, traveling with my son, wife. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back.\"\n\nSo, basically, why force himself to stop? Why not try to see how much more his body can take?\n\nWhy not hope to stay out there, doing what he's done so well for so long, and maybe just give himself and his family -- particularly his kid, still too young to remember what is happening yet -- some memories to hold onto one day?\n\n\"If I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while,\" Nadal explained. \"I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see -- I need to give myself a little bit longer ... to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\"\n\nMakes perfect sense.\n\nEspecially considering what both opponents took away from this latest performance, which was hardly up to Nadal's career-long standards but did include the occasional patch of play that might have been good enough to get past a lesser obstacle than Zverev.\n\nThe 27-year-old German is, after all, ranked No. 4, was the runner-up at the U.S. Open four years ago and the gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago. Plus, he is coming off a clay title at the Italian Open and has been a semifinalist at Roland Garros each of the past three years.\n\n\"I mean, I was not that far,\" Nadal said. \"That's my feeling.\"\n\nZverev's assessment: \"If he stays healthy, he's going to continue playing better.\"\n\nNadal sounded as though he agreed with that. He also asked for some time to make up his mind.\n\n\"Give me two months 'til the Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, 'OK, guys, it's more than enough.' Let's see,\" Nadal said Monday evening, after only his fourth loss in 116 French Open matches. \"I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures:

Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going - and to target more gold.\n\nNadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him.\n\nHowever, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years - in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios.\n\n\"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal. \"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, [but] I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\n\n\"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\"\n\nNadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added.\n\n\"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to.\n\n\"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\"\n\nLonger term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun.\n\n\"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-14815997/6c9606f25ebf514f9de2e4411194a9e9c91460df-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Olympic success, we look back at Nadal's extraordinary record at the Games.\n\nNadal did not play singles at his first Olympics in Athens 20 years ago, focusing on doubles.\n\nBut the Spaniard won gold on his singles debut at the following Games, winning the title at Beijing 2008.\n\nSecond seed at the event - and fresh off consecutive French Open and Wimbledon wins - Nadal eased into the last four, where he beat Novak Djokovic 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to guarantee a medal.\n\nAnd he claimed the first gold medal of his career in the final, downing Chile's Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 7-6(2), 6-3 to seal victory.\n\nStruggling with injury, Nadal was forced to pull out of his title defence at London 2012 - though returned to action at the Rio 2016 Games.\n\nThird seed at the Games, Nadal ended the charge of home favourite Thomaz Bellucci in the last eight, though was beaten 5-7, 6-4, 7-6(5) by Juan Martin del Potro in an epic semi-final.\n\nIn a bronze medal playoff shrouded in controversy - with opponent Kei Nishikori taking a lengthy break after the second set - he was beaten by 6-2, 6-7(1), 6-3 as he was forced to settle for fourth.\n\nNadal was just 18 when making his Olympic debut in Athens, playing doubles alongside now-coach Carlos Moya - though the duo lost in straight sets to Brazil's Andre Sa and Flavio Saretta.\n\nFour years later, Nadal was the sixth seed in the doubles draw alongside Tommy Robredo, though this campaign was only marginally better than his previous tilt at doubles glory.\n\nThey beat Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman and Robin Soderling in round one but were then beaten by Australian duo Christopher Guccione and Lleyton Hewitt.\n\nFast forward eight years, and it was an entirely different story.\n\nSeeded sixth alongside frequent partner Marc Lopez, Nadal eased through to the last four - where he and Lopez beat Canada's Daniel Nestor and Vasek Pospisil in two tiebreaks to reach the gold medal match.\n\nAnd the Spaniard memorably claimed the second Olympic gold of his legendary career, battling past Romanian fifth seeds Florin Mergea and Horia Tecau 6-2, 3-6, 6-4.\n\nNadal was meant to play mixed doubles alongside Garbine Muguruza in Rio, but the duo withdrew pre-tournament.\n\nAfter skipping Tokyo 2020 due to injury, Nadal will be looking for a strong Olympic farewell in Paris this summer - potentially making his last Roland Garros appearance.\n\nNadal's comments after his French Open loss send an Olympic-sized statement of intent, as it appears he will skip Wimbledon to prioritize the Games.\n\nCurrently ranked 275th, the 22-time Slam winner is well outside the Olympic entry list cutoff.\n\nBut he is an obvious pick for one of the two Wildcard spots saved for Grand Slam winners, and - should his body be willing - he looks set to play.\n\nAnd all eyes will be on whether he plays doubles as well, with himself and Carlos Alcaraz publicly expressing interest in a blockbuster partnership between the two.", "source":

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a joke of a tally. The recitation of which enabled a somber occasion to start with some levity.\n\nPresumptively, this was to be Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last French Open, his final raging against the dying of the light. He turns 38 next week. His current ranking slums outside the top 250, the kind of grim math that comes when your body doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let you play\u00e2\u20ac\"much less win\u00e2\u20ac\"many matches.\n\nHe entered the tournament unseeded, jarring in itself. And, the tennis fates did their thing, yielding a first-round opponent of \u00e2\u20ac| Alexander Zverev, the fourth seed, the player who won last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big preview event in Rome, one of the top contenders, the last player at Roland Garros to push Nadal.\n\nSo it was these last dance vibes that came edged with a wince. The Rolling Stones or Elton John can announce a final tour. They may not hit every note. But they also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose in straight sets to, say, Mumford & Sons.\n\nTickets to the most anticipated match in the history of tennis\u00e2\u20ac\"it's not hyperbole: try and name another\u00e2\u20ac\"fetched $5000 on the secondary markets and brought out both royalty and tennis nobility. Though he plays tomorrow, Novak Djokovic was in the stands. As was Carlos Alcaraz, the betting favorite to win this event. Iga \u00c5\u0161wi\u00c4...tek, the defending women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s champion, finished her first-round assignation, showered and took a seat.\n\nAs for the match itself \u00e2\u20ac| it played out as expected. Nostalgia and hope are powerful intoxicants. But eventually, they regress to the mean, and talent and time win out.\n\nThere were moments when Nadal did a convincing Nadal impersonation, striking the ball ferociously, picking off volleys, looking like the clay court impresario whose career record at this venue, going into today, was 112\u00e2\u20ac\"3. There were times when he looked like a man in his late 30s\u00e2\u20ac\"playing a fine opponent, more than a decade younger. There were times when he looked fresh, and there were times he looked physically spent, as one would expect from any player who had gone more than 450 days without playing a best-of-five match.\n\nNadal was, inauspiciously, broken to start the match, and Zverev took the first set 6\u00e2\u20ac\"3. Nadal broke Zverev and served for the second, electrifying the crowd. When he failed to close, the deflation was palpable. When he lost the second set in a tiebreaker, this went from an exercise in potentially witnessing history to an exercise in potentially witnessing Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final match, at least at the French Open.\n\nThe third set was Nadal's insistence on not going quietly. He got up an early break. He then gave up that early break and fell 6\u00e2\u20ac\"3, 7\u00e2\u20ac\"6, 6\u00e2\u20ac\"3. Respectable? Absolutely. But not the result befitting a 14-time champ.\n\nYou cite the comical, flattering stats, you also have to cite the downers. For the first time in nearly 20 years, Nadal lost in the first round of a clay event. For the first time here, he lost in the first round. For the first time ever, he has now lost back-to-back matches on clay.\u00c2\n\nCredit Zverev for compartmentalizing, ignoring the occasion, locking in mentally, and simply bringing his flagrant talent\u00e2\u20ac\"especially on his backhand\u00e2\u20ac\"to bear. He can now pivot from this momentous match to trying to win his first major, a distinct possibility. (Zverev's appeal of a penalty order issued by a German court stemming from domestic abuse allegations made by his ex-girlfriend goes to trial during the tournament.)\n\nAs for Nadal \u00e2\u20ac| who knows? He called off a retirement ceremony the tournament had planned. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being coy about the endpoint of his unrivaled career. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that, by all accounts, he genuinely doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know when the ride will end. Ironically his last match might be in Paris in two months, assuming he fulfills his vow to play in the 2024 Olympics.\n\nHe left the court wearing a look of resignation. One that suggested he has played the French Open for the last time. But also\u00e2\u20ac\"a champion to the end\u00e2\u20ac\"that he genuinely thought he could take this match.\u00c2", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mason, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumford_&_Sons", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumford & Sons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impresario", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impresario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elton John"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiebreaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiebreaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Collecting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5162,h_2903,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/si/01hyxf9nvrpzz76tkbrn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

So, someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nREAD | Why Rafael Nadal will not have a farewell ceremony at Roland Garros this year\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nZverev is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match.\n\nThe 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nMauresmo was asked about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nLatest on SportstarKKR vs SRH, IPL 2024 Final Live Match in Pictures: Kolkata's bowlers rattle Sunrisers in the PowerPlayLavanya Lakshmi Narayanan _11351KKR vs SRH, IPL 2024 Final: Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma fall inside two oversTeam SportstarKKR vs SRH Live Score, IPL 2024 Final: SRH 21/2 (4 overs); Head falls for golden duck, Starc castles Abhishek Sharma in first overTeam SportstarF1 Monaco Grand Prix Live Updates, Formula One 2024: Leclerc extends lead to Piastri; Sainz, Norris follow behindTeam SportstarFrench Open 2024: What did tournament director Mauresmo say on Nadal being unseeded; Zverev's domestic abuse trial?

He dropped serve in the opening game of the match and had nine unforced errors to just five winners in the first set.\n\nNadal bounced back in the second and took a 5-3 lead thanks to a service break in the fifth game. Fans were seeing shades of his old self and gaining some hope an instant classic was in store.\n\nThat belief steadily waned as Zverev won the next four games and eventually took the set in the tiebreaker.\n\nWith Nadal down two sets to none, the question became less about whether he could pull off the upset and instead about if his last French Open ever would end in a first-round, straight-set loss.\n\nFor most fans, the occasion was an opportunity to enjoy a legendary star one more time.\n\nIt's anybody's guess as to what the future holds for Nadal, either for the rest of this season or the 2025 Grand Slam calendar. He has logged a relatively light schedule so far in 2024, so his availability for Wimbledon and the U.S. Open isn't assured.\n\nGreat athletes rarely get to exit on their own terms, and that's especially true in such an unforgiving sport such as tennis. The last few years of Roger Federer's career were pretty unremarkable before he walked away altogether.\n\nLosing to Zverev wasn't the way you would've scripted Nadal's farewell, but at least the general certainty over his likely departure allowed everyone to appreciate his legacy at Roland-Garros.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_15,y_27,w_1752,h_1168,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1716826790/k0euo9rpqwqniexsqnyn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

All of us were eagerly anticipating the match between Nadal and Alexander Zverev.\n\nFirst, we watched Women's Tennis Association No 1 singles player Iga \u015awi\u0105tek commence the defense of her 2023 French Open Title, as she attempts to win the fifth grand slam of her young career at the French Open, entering the tournament on a 12-match winning streak. If she wins the title this year, she will match Justine Henin's three French Open titles in a row.\n\n\"In the current era of women's tennis, no player has achieved so much in such a short space of time, and even \u015awi\u0105tek admits that her success has been a surprise,\" according to a CNN article.\n\nRoland Garros, which is the official name of the French Open, is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. The tournament, which is named after the renowned French aviator Roland Garros, has a storied past that dates back to 1891. It has been the site of some of the most memorable moments in the history of tennis, and today it saw what might be the final match in the Paris tournament for the 22-time Grand Slam singles title legend.\n\nPhillipe-Chartier Court, the primary court at Roland Garros, is named after the former president of the French Tennis Federation, who played a significant role in the introduction of tennis to the Olympics. The court has been the site of numerous legendary matches. The red clay surface of the court generates an environment that is unparalleled in the tennis world. It hosted a match today that will be cherished for generations.\n\nThe audience erupted in a combination of cheers for Zverev and an emotional ovation for Nadal upon Zverev's victory in the final point. Nadal lost, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3.\n\nWitnessing the sunset of an era was a bittersweet experience. The past few years have been characterized by these moments as a wave of luminaries, including Serena Williams, Roger Federer, and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, have retired.\n\nUpon my departure from the stadium on Memorial Day, I was overwhelmed by a profound sense of gratitude for the tournament and the stadium's rich history. Attending Nadal's match was a privilege. It was a game that I, along with the thousands of fans who witnessed it in person and on television, will never forget.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armstrong_williams@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Armstrong Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serena Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Mart\u00edn_del_Potro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_1352_cd657b-rotated-e1716820774499.jpeg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

While Rafa gave hints towards a potential retirement, he also delighted fans with the idea of him stepping foot on the Court Philippe-Chatrier in the next few weeks.\n\nWhile it may be the last time that Rafael Nadal participated in Roland Garros, he expressed his desire to set foot on the Court Philippe-Chatrier during the upcoming Olympics. Stating that his next main goal was to represent Spain in the Paris Games 2024, Nadal said:\n\n\"I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here.\n\nIf I feel myself competitive and fit to enjoy, I will continue for a while because I'm having fun.

Responding to this, the former World No.1 shed light on the idea of a playing double alongside his younger compatriot.\n\n\"Carlos doesn't have to ask me anything. All things being well, we'll play,\" Nadal said. \"It's also hugely exciting for me. If I'm not mistaken, I've heard it is for him too.\n\n\"So it would be great to play the odd tournament before the Olympics to prepare ourselves and to get some rapport on court,\" Rafa said, per Sky Sports.\n\nThe thought of sharing the court with his role model excited Alcaraz as well.\n\n\"If everything goes to plan, like I have already said, we will play the doubles together at the Olympics,\" Alcaraz said in a media interaction earlier this year.\n\nWhile the duo won't be regarded as the favorites to win the event, they will surely have the undivided attention of the entire tennis world when they take on the court.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_(roller_coaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raging Bull (roller coaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/57114e62-untitled-design-22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The match is scheduled to be third in the main stadium, Court Philippe Chatrier, and could start at around 3:30 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. EDT).\n\nHere are some answers to questions about Nadal and Zverev:\n\nWhy are top players like Nadal and Zverev meeting in the first round?\n\nDespite having such a dominant record at the French Open, Nadal was not seeded and so could have been placed anywhere in the bracket and been stuck playing anyone at all, even the very best opponents. Because of injuries, including a surgically repaired hip and problematic abdominal muscle, Nadal has competed little the past two seasons, going only 7-4 in 2024, and so someone who has been ranked No. 1 and spent more than a decade inside the top 10 is now outside the top 250.\n\nWhy isn't Nadal seeded?\n\nThis is Nadal's first Grand Slam tournament without a seeding since the 2005 Australian Open. The top 32 players in the men's and women's draws are seeded, and the seedings are based on the ATP and WTA rankings, which take into account the most recent 52 weeks of results. In theory, Mauresmo could have opted to circumvent the rules and go ahead and award a seeding to Nadal based on his past performances in Paris. But that was never really considered, she said, in part because \"giving protection to some players\" would result in \"a lot of other issues and problems,\" and because \"it also has to be OK with other Grand Slams and everything.\"\n\nWhat difference do seedings make?\n\nPlayers who are seeded, such as Zverev, are guaranteed to avoid going up against another seeded player any earlier than the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, which have 128-player fields and require seven victories to earn a championship.\n\nWhat do other players think?\n\nPlayers tend to agree with Mauresmo's decision, with several saying they believe the seeding system should remain the way it currently is (Wimbledon used to seed players according to their results on grass courts, but has strictly followed the rankings since 2021). \"The way that the seedings work, I think it's appropriate. In this case, it's unfortunate how that happened, but I don't know how you gauge where someone should and shouldn't be seeded based on past or previous success,\" said three-time major champion Andy Murray. \"It'd be quite hard to do that.\"\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev?\n\nHe is a leading player in men's tennis, one who is coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open, won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics and was the 2020 U.S. Open runner-up. He reached the semifinals at the French Open each of the past three years, including in 2022, when he played Nadal at that stage but had to stop after tearing ligaments in his right foot during the match. Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany, is about to face a court proceeding that starts next week in Berlin related to accusations of physically abusing an ex-girlfriend. He does not need to be in court and said he will not be. \"At the end of the day, I do believe in the German system. I do believe in the truth, as well. I have to be certain that, you know, I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do,\" Zverev said. \"That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that.\"\n\nWhy is Zverev allowed to play during his ongoing court case?\n\nMauresmo was asked Sunday about Zverev's status and replied: \"As long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national

He noted, \"Of course, he has emotions and probably had a sleepless night because he didn't know whether it would be the last time. He wanted to say goodbye well. Then his opponent was Zverev, against whom he can lose even on a good day.

Rafa!' - BusinessWorld Online", "body": "PARIS -- Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\n\"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Mr. Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday.\n\n\"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100 percent sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Mr. Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14 title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organizers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nThere was another break for Mr. Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Mr. Zverev left their semifinal match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal vs Zverev clash as Ms. Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1, 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nMs. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1 for her 50 Grand Slam match victory.\n\nThe 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from an early break down in the third set where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3 only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I mean, the reaction is something that I expected in some way. When you're not seeded, anything can happen. That's part of the business,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile Zverev had a different take and preferred facing Nadal at a later stage. \"Ideally I would have liked to play him in at a later stage of the tournament um but it is how it is now. He is unseeded this year, I am seeded. It's a tough draw but it's a tough draw for both of us and we'll see how it goes,\" the German said.\n\nNadal attempted his comeback in January this year, losing in the Brisbane International quarterfinals.

There's only a few guys that would beat him playing this well. And Zverev was the worst opponent possible in the first round, worse than playing (Novak) Djokovic, worse than playing (Carlos) Alcaraz.\"\n\nWilander said the fact the roof on Philippe Chatrier was closed for the match worked against Nadal.\n\n\"The circumstances, it's indoor, cold outside, the ball doesn't travel. So I think all that, and still being so close it's all positive for Rafa and with that passion, why not. He knows how to win big matches on this court,\" the Swede said.\n\nAlex Corretja, the former world number two, said he had detected a change in heart from his compatriot Nadal.\n\n\"I spoke to him a couple of months ago and he was sure he wouldn't be back (at the French Open),\" Corretja told Eurosport.\n\n\"But then I spoke to him a week ago, and he said to me it's the first time I've been practising here at Roland Garros that I feel no pain.

I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\"\n\nIt will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris.\n\nThe French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars.\n\nSpain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court.\n\nOn a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment.\n\nThe German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line.\n\nAs soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set.\n\n\"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party.\n\nNadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won.\n\nThere was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time.\n\nThere was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.\n\nSwiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023.\n\nCoco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory.\n\nSixth seed Maria Sakkari crashed out of the first round as Russian-born Varvara Gracheva, who now represents France, came back from a set down to secure a 3-6 6-4 6-3 victory.\n\nIn the men's draw, Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, who suffered a shock first-round exit at last year's French Open, ensured a longer stay at Roland Garros this time around with a 6-3 6-4 5-7 6-3 win over Germany's Dominik Koepfer.\n\nMedvedev had leaned on his serve and a slew of shots to comfortably grab the first two sets before a determined Koepfer suddenly stepped up his game.\n\nKoepfer came back from a early break down in the third set where Medvedev's bid to force a tiebreaker was thwarted when the German broke serve to grab the set.\n\nKoepfer then double-faulted to gift the Russian a break to open the fourth set but got back on serve at 3-3 only for Medvedev to close out the day's final match on Court Simonne-Mathieu by winning the next three games.\n\nIn other men's action, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.\n\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot;

Nadal is the most dominant player in French Open history, with 14 titles to his name, but injuries have piled up in recent years and he has hinted that he's nearing the end of his playing days.\n\nThe King of Clay, as he's known, has a ridiculous 112-3 record at Roland-Garros, with his most recent win coming in 2022. From 2005 to 2014, he won 9 out of 10 French Open titles, and 5 of 6 from 2017 to 2022. Last year, Nadal withdrew before the tournament due to injury and is unseeded going into this year's Slam.\n\nHis top competition is defending champion and No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, who Nadal last beat at Roland-Garros in the 2022 quarterfinals. But it's going to be a tall order even getting that far, as the unseeded Nadal plays No. 4 Alexander Zverev in the first round. This is the first time since 2005 that Nadal has been unseeded in a Grand Slam.\n\nDjokovic is the top seed and also the defending champion in the men's bracket, but he's been off to a rocky start in 2024. The 37-year-old Serb has 24 Grand Slams to his name, but hasn't made a tournament final this year. No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner is coming off a victory in the Australian Open -- where he bested Djokovic in the semifinals, and No. 3 seed Carlos Alcaraz is still riding momentum from his 2023 Wimbledon victory.\n\nIf both Nadal and Djokovic make it that far, the two will meet in the semifinals. The top Americans on the men's side include No. 12 Taylor Fritz, No. 14 Tommy Paul, and No. 15 Ben Shelton, though no American has made it to the quarterfinals of Roland-Garros since 2003.\n\nYou can find the entire men's bracket below, followed by viewing information, the schedule of play, and as the tournament progresses: results.\n\nIf you're watching on TV, your cable or satellite package will need both the Tennis Channel and NBC if you're hoping to catch everything, in addition to a Peacock subscription.

However, despite the verdict, Zverev maintained his innocence and contested the charge.\n\nAnd on May 31st, Zverev's hearing is scheduled to start in Germany.

Zverev denied these allegations and Sharypova did not go to the police with them, although they prompted a research by the Association of Tennis Professionals, the governing body of tennis tours, which found insufficient evidence to support the claims.\n\nMain critics\n\nIn the wake of the allegations, Zverev faced public criticism after being elected to the ATP Advisory Board in January. American tennis star Sloane Stephens told reporters at the time, a women's star facing similar allegations would not have been elected to the WTA players' council, while Iga Swiatek, the No. 1 women's player, told reporters it is not good for a player facing such accusations to get some kind of promotion.\n\n< position=\"inread\" progressive=\"\" ad-id=\"article-0-inread\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"presentation\"/>\n\nSurprising fact\n\nZverev starred in an episode of Netflix's since-canceled docuseries Breaking point dedicated last year to his recovery from an ankle ligament tear and surgery that sidelined the German star for months. Controversial, the episode never mentioned the accusations against Zverev. The show was on cancelled in March.\n\nWhat to pay attention to\n\nZverev faces Nadal, a fourteen-time French Open champion, in the first round of play at Roland Garros on Monday at 6 a.m. EST. Nadal, the 37-year-old Spaniard who has 92 singles titles to his name and holds the record as the winningest player in the men's singles competition at the French Open, entered the tournament unseeded after a series of injuries left him sidelined for months. He last won in 2022, beating Zverev in the semifinals, who tripped and injured his ankle so badly that he left the field in a wheelchair and was sidelined from the sport for months.\n\nLarge number\n\nOver $2.6 million. That is the amount that the winner of the men's singles match at the French Open will take home as the top prize (approximately 2.4 million euros).\n\nImportant background\n\nZverev burst onto the international tennis scene as a 20-year-old in 2017, beating three-time French Open winner Novak Djokovic at the 2017 Italian Open and Swiss star Roger Federer at the Rogers Cup the same year. In 2018, he was named to Forbes Europe's 30 Under 30 in Entertainment, along with artist Dua Lipa, actress Millie Bobby Brown and actor Daniel Kaluuya.

I really hope to be well prepared.\n\n\"The amount of feelings I have had on this amazing court during my tennis career have been unbelievable. I could not imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 - I wish I was 28. It has been a beautiful process.\n\n\"What makes me feel so special is all the people who are at Roland Garros behind the scenes who have been helping me from my first visit here.

Whether you're a seasoned fan or new to the sport, Nadal's journey at the French Open is nothing short of legendary, and it's a story worth revisiting as we approach another thrilling tournament season.\n\nRafael Nadal, often referred to as the \"King of Clay,\" first burst onto the scene at Roland Garros in 2005. At just 19 years old, Nadal showcased his prowess on the clay courts by winning the French Open in his debut year, a feat that immediately set him apart from his contemporaries. This victory was just the beginning of a career that would see him redefine the limits of clay court tennis.\n\nNadal's record at Roland Garros is nothing short of extraordinary. As of today, he has won the French Open a record 14 times, cementing his status as the greatest clay court player in tennis history. His relentless pursuit of excellence and unmatched skill on the clay courts have made him a formidable opponent. Each victory at Roland Garros has added another layer to his legacy, showcasing his incredible consistency and dominance.\n\nOne of the defining aspects of Nadal's career at Roland Garros has been his rivalry with Roger Federer. Their epic clashes, particularly in the finals, have not only provided some of the most thrilling moments in tennis history but have also highlighted Nadal's superior clay court skills. Each match between these two legends at Roland Garros has been a masterclass in tennis, with Nadal often coming out on top.\n\nNadal's success at Roland Garros is not just about skill; it's also a testament to his physical and mental fortitude. The grueling nature of clay court tennis demands exceptional stamina, and Nadal's rigorous training and unmatched resilience have enabled him to endure and thrive in these conditions. His ability to bounce back from injuries and his mental toughness in critical moments have been key factors in his sustained success.\n\nNadal's legacy at Roland Garros extends beyond his victories. He has inspired a generation of tennis players and fans, showcasing the importance of dedication, hard work, and passion. His influence is evident in the increased popularity of clay court tennis and the heightened competitiveness of the French Open. Young players look up to Nadal not only for his achievements but also for his sportsmanship and humility.\n\nAs we look forward to the next edition of the French Open, the question on everyone's mind is whether Nadal will add another title to his already impressive tally. Regardless of the outcome, his legacy at Roland Garros is secure. Each tournament provides an opportunity to witness history in the making, as Nadal continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on the clay courts.\n\nRafael Nadal's journey at Roland Garros is a testament to his unparalleled skill, determination, and love for the game. His legacy is a source of inspiration for athletes and fans alike, reminding us of the beauty of tennis and the spirit of competition. As we celebrate his achievements and look forward to more, Nadal's name will forever be etched in the annals of tennis history.\n\nThank you for reading!

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThis assault case follows previous abuse allegations against Zverev from his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova, who accused the German star of punching her in the face and covering her face with a pillow, leaving her \"scared for [her]\n\nIn the wake of the allegations, Zverev faced public criticism after he was elected to an ATP advisory council in January. U.S. tennis star Sloane Stephens told reporters at the time a women's star facing similar charges would not have been elected to the WTA player council, while Iga Swiatek, the No. 1 women's player, told reporters \"it's not good when a player who's facing charges like that is kind of being promoted.\"\n\nZverev starred in an episode of Netflix' since-canceled docuseries \"Break Point\" last year dedicated to his recovery from an ankle ligament tear and a surgery that sidelined the German star for months. Controversially, the episode never mentioned the allegations against Zverev. The show was canceled in March.\n\nZverev faces Nadal, a 14-time French Open champion, in the first round of play at Roland Garros at 6 a.m. EST on Monday. Nadal, the 37-year old Spaniard, who has 92 singles titles to his name and holds the record as the winningest player in men's singles competition at the French Open, entered the tournament unseeded following a string of injuries that kept him sidelined for months. He last won in 2022, defeating in the semifinals Zverev, who stumbled and injured his ankle so badly he left the court in a wheelchair and was sidelined from the sport for months.\n\nOver $2.6 million.

That is the best compliment I can possibly think to give to an athlete in any sport.\n\nNumbers are how I make sense of the world. Through them, you can come to understand how a game is played and what matters the most within it. Each sport has its statistical guidelines, its must-win categories and its unbreakable records. And throughout what will end up going down as about a 23-year career, as Roger Federer was breaking geometry and Novak Djokovic was breaking the laws of flexibility and fitness -- and Andy Murray, pushing so hard to reach the top of the sport, ended up breaking himself -- Nadal made absolute nonsense out of the numbers that define tennis.\n\nNadal will retire in the coming days, weeks or months. He has committed to playing in the Laver Cup this fall. He has suggested he is hoping to participate in the Paris Olympics this summer in some capacity. We don't know where the end will come, exactly, but for every tournament he enters, he's almost certainly doing so for the last time. And with the French Open starting Sunday, that means that the greatest clay-courter of all time, who has won at Roland Garros an utterly impossible 14 times, is playing there for the last time, too. It makes me want to reflect a bit.\n\nAnd that means talking about numbers.\n\nYou'd love to hit more winners than your opponent. Suffer fewer errors. Land more unreturnable first serves. But while tennis' most prevalent statistics mostly track how points ended, tennis players are far more concerned with how points are constructed. That can mean moving your opponent around as much as possible, or targeting your opponent's weaknesses, whatever they might be. But at a macro level, point construction can often simply mean setting yourself up to hit more forehands than your opponent. Even if your backhand is excellent, and even if your forehand is merely average, the backhand is still a more awkward stroke, and it usually behooves you to manipulate the court in a way that keeps you swinging from the forehand side.\n\nNadal was never the biggest hitter or most aggressive player on tour. His serve speed never went too far beyond 110 mph. Whereas a big server such as Andy Roddick or Pete Sampras would hit aces about 13-15% of the time, Nadal was at about 4%. Whereas a big hitter like Ben Shelton or Stan Wawrinka might hit winners on 34-35% of points, Nadal was around 28-29% -- better than most but not a statistical standout. But because of his left-handedness, and because he had the best wrists in the history of the sport and could generate absurd torque with his topspin, he could put opponents in backhand jail for as long as he wanted.\n\nTennis Abstract's amazing match-charting project has collected manual data from more than 13,000 matches and eight million total shots. It gives us a look under tennis' hood, and it reveals one of Nadal's superpowers.\n\nIn 641 charted matches, Roger Federer hit forehands for 48.8% of his groundstrokes. In 533 matches, Novak Djokovic was at 48.9%. In 302 matches, Andy Murray was at 49.1%. Three of the best players the sport has ever produced were just looking for a 50-50 split here.\n\nIn 478 charted matches, meanwhile, Nadal hit forehands 55.0% of the time. In a sport in which even winning one more point for every 50 you play can make you skyrocket in the rankings, that is a world of difference. Nadal had plenty of ways to win a point. His defense was second to none -- well, maybe second to only Djokovic -- and we all have a nightmare list of otherworldly running passing shots Nadal hit against our favorite player of choice. You don't win 22 Slams if you aren't ridiculously well-rounded.\n\nBut when in doubt, Nadal could simply whip nonstop forehands into the backhand corner against right-handed opponents (and most opponents are right-handed). Whereas most players find a repeatable edge by figuring out how to win quick points -- more than two-thirds of all points last four shots or fewer, after all -- Nadal won only 51% of points with 0-4 shots. But he won 54% of points with between 4-6 shots, 55% of points with 7-9 shots and 54% of points with 10-plus shots. He would lean on you, and you would eventually fall.\n\nYou can almost blame Nadal for the demise of the one-handed backhand, too. With the torque and height that his forehand generated, even Federer, with just about the most aesthetically-pleasing one-hander of all time, could neither generate proper power with a topspin backhand nor kill the pace and reset the point with a slice backhand. Nadal hit a higher percentage of forehands than Federer in 25 of the 35 matches charted at Tennis Abstract, and while Federer would typically slice about 37% of his backhands, he was lucky to hit 20% against Nadal. In those 35 matches, Federer went 5-5 when he was able to slice at least 20% of the time and 8-17 when he wasn't.\n\nAnd if Federer couldn't counter this weapon, then what chance did one-handed backhand artisans like Stefanos Tsitsipas (2-7 all time against Nadal) or Grigor Dimitrov (1-14) have? That one-hander Dominic Thiem was able to go 6-10 against Nadal was remarkable, but (a) he was only 1-5 in best-of-five matches, and (b) the spin Thiem generated in response was uncommon. It might not be a total surprise that he ended up with the wrist problems that are ending his career this year.\n\nIt goes beyond rallies, though. Think of what it means to be able to pull an opponent off the court with your absurd lefty kick serve on the ad court, where a vast majority of break points you face will come. While right-handers can do that in the deuce court, they're at less of an advantage in the ad court. And while all points matter, in tennis some matter more than others.\n\nWide first-serve percentage on break points (via Tennis Abstract): Nadal 60%, Federer 47%, Djokovic 46%, Murray 42%\n\nBreak points saved: Federer 67%, Nadal 66%, Djokovic 65%, Murray 62%\n\nWith a serve far slower than Federer's, Nadal was almost equally adept at saving break points.\n\nNadal will likely finish his career with 92 ATP titles. That's obviously an awesome number, but it ranks a mere fifth all time behind Jimmy Connors (109), Federer (103), Djokovic (98) and Ivan Lendl (94). But that lefty kick was patently unfair on clay courts, where he set records that might never be broken.\n\nHe hasn't just won the most French Opens; he has won more than twice as many as anyone else in the Open era. Bjorn Borg, the single most dominant figure during tennis' explosion in popularity in the late-1970s, won six titles at Roland Garros. On the women's side, Chris Evert won seven. If you go back to the early-1900s, long before there was any sort of tour formality in tennis, a man named Max Decugis won eight. Nadal won 14.\n\nSince the 1910s, only one man has won more than three Monte Carlo Open titles: Nadal, who won 11, including a stretch of eight in a row.\n\nOnly two people have won more than three Italian Opens: Djokovic has six, and Nadal has 10. He has the most Madrid Open titles, too, but somehow the fact that he won only five of those feels underwhelming. That's what he did to title math. \"Five titles at one of the sport's preeminent clay-court events? I guess that's decent.\"\n\nAs he heads into his final French Open, Nadal is 539-66 all time on clay. That's a win percentage of 0.891, which is pretty ridiculous in itself. But it includes going 72-25 from 2001-03 and going 5-3 this year. In between the start and (presumable) finish of his career, he went 462-38, a win percentage of 0.924. He was unbeaten on clay in 2006 and 2010, lost just once five times (2007, 2008, 2012, 2017 and 2018) and lost just twice five times (2005, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2022). Quick reminder: He played in the same era as what might have been the other two greatest men's tennis players of all time. And he still owned about one-third of the tennis calendar for nearly two decades!\n\nIndeed, when we talk about any one of the Big Three -- Federer, Nadal and Djokovic -- it's easy to get caught up in the sheer volume of their individual achievements. But the fact that they achieved all these things despite having to share the stage with each other is almost disorienting. And it leads us to some spectacular what-ifs.\n\nNadal is going to retire with the second-most men's Slam titles ever (22). But he lost four Slam finals to Federer and four more to Djokovic. He also twice lost to Djokovic in the semifinals of a Slam that Djokovic ended up winning.\n\nFederer won 20 Slam titles but lost six Slam finals to Nadal -- four at the French Open, plus one each at Wimbledon (you might remember that one) and the Australian Open -- and another four to Djokovic. He also lost to one of them seven times in the semifinals of a Slam the victor would go on to win.\n\nWith 24, Djokovic will end up winning the career Slam titles race. But he still lost four finals to Nadal and one to Federer, and he still lost five semis to the eventual Slam winner.\n\nTo be sure, each of these titans had an effect on each other. Nadal had to aspire to the level Federer first set and then craft a game that could top him. Then Djokovic did the same. That they all had to figure out ways to beat each other inevitably raised each of their individual games. But it's impossible not to think of the totals one of these players might have generated had one of the others decided to take up, say, basketball or golf or something.\n\nMath can be awfully cold. I can use stats to point out just how much Nadal's immortal return game and defense have fallen off during his latest comeback from his latest round of injuries. Back in 2018, when he went 26-1 on clay, he broke serve an otherworldly 47% of the time and won 48% of return points; this year he's at 30% and 40%, respectively. He still spends a lot of points looking like the version of himself we grew accustomed to, but the cumulative effects of age and injury are pretty clear. And the fact that he drew Alexander Zverev in the first round is rather cruel.\n\nZverev has won three of the past four complete matches the two have played, including one on clay. He lands the most first serves of any top-50 player and holds serve more than anyone besides Jannik Sinner (the best player of 2024 so far) and Hubert Hurkacz, who blew Nadal off the court 6-1, 6-3 in Rome last week.\n\nMath tells us pretty dire things about what will probably happen when Zverev and Nadal meet. But if there's any hope in seeing Nadal make one last run in Paris, it stems from a pretty obvious place: Math has never mattered much when Nadal's involved.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType":

Without doubt the French Open was the Major in which the Spaniard enjoyed his best tennis. Nadal's performances on clay were the most dominant the sport has ever seen on a particular surface - and make up 14 of his 22 Grand Slam triumphs.\n\nAs the curtain falls, here are the five biggest moments of Rafael Nadal's career.\n\nAfter two consecutive Major wins in the months prior, Nadal won Olympic Gold in a straight sets victory over Fernando Gonzalez of Chile on hardcourt, his biggest success up until that point on the surface. Nadal became the World No.1 for the first time in his career, ending the dominant run rival Roger Federer had enjoyed that is still the longest reign in history.\n\nNadal fought back from two sets down against Daniil Medvedev in the final to win his second Australian Open and complete the Career Grand Slam twice. Dubbed \"the miracle in Melbourne\", it was one of the greatest comebacks in the history of Major finals. It was a record-breaking 21 Major's won for a male player and saw Nadal overtake his big three counterparts, who were both on 20 at the time.\n\nNadal's maiden title at the US Open, this victory completed the set of all four Majors. Not only did Nadal's victory over Novak Djokovic mean he had completed the Career Grand Slam, but it also meant he was only the second man in history to achieve the Career Golden Slam, after Andre Agassi. The pair are the only two players in history to win all four Slams, as well as winning Olympic Gold.\n\nThe first Major of Nadal's career, he came from a set down to defeat Mariano Puerta and claim the first of 14 titles in Paris. This was the beginning of a run of four consecutive wins at the French Open, before losing in the semi-final in 2009 in the same year Federer was finally able to win what would be his only trophy there, mainly due to the dominance of Nadal.\n\nThe Spaniard won five in a row from 2010 to 2014. No player has dominated a Major the way the Spaniard dominated in Paris, winning 112 out of 115 matches on the French clay.\n\nThe 2008 Wimbledon final is widely regarded as not only the greatest final ever to be played at the All England Club, but as the greatest tennis match of all time. By this time Nadal had established himself as the King of Clay but had come up short on grass to Federer in the two previous finals.\n\nFederer was at the top of his game during these years, and would have made it five consecutive titles at Wimbledon had he toppled Nadal in the final. After five sets, Nadal came out victorious and had showed that he was able to compete with Federer, not just on clay, but on the surface and at the Major Federer dominated the most throughout his career.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardcourt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariano_Puerta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mariano Puerta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Employment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Outplacement", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Outplacement", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn4.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Rafael-Nadal-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

He's been under the knife, and has been riding a roller-coaster of hope and disappointment ever since. The Spaniard is walking a fine line. So long has his ordeal been, so dark many of his days, that he looked like he may never return.\n\nNow he is back, albeit with mixed results -- but how could they not be after so long on the sidelines? His opponent in the first round will be Alexander Zverev. The German is in better form than anyone, entering Paris behind his title run at the Rome ATP Masters 1000.\n\nIt's a tough draw for Nadal, but also for Zverev, who must face the 14-time Roland Garros champion on what has essentially become his home court.\n\nHours before the marquee clash, Moya revealed the depth of Nadal's insecurity, explained the painstaking road to arriving at Roland Garros and confirmed what we already knew: that Nadal will give his all on the clay where he built a legacy the likes of which has never been seen before.\n\nHow is Rafa?\n\nImproving. On the up. The level in practice is pretty high. Now he needs to bring that to the matches. We believe he's fit enough to play with confidence.\n\nHe also practised well in Rome, but then he lost to Hurkacz in the second round. Not like here. There were a lot of ups and downs there. At times he would play at a high level, but he lacked consistency... Since his return it was perhaps the first time he went into a match feeling confident [against Hurkacz]. It didn't go as we expected. Now, the week he's had of practice could help him produce the level he always looks for in competition.\n\nSo has this been the best training since his return?\n\nWithout a doubt. In Rome he had some good sessions and others not so good. Here, they've all been positive. They're practice sessions, but he hasn't lost a set so far. I think it's come at the best time. It was also to be expected. We were coming from a long way down, the furthest down, at least since I've been working with him. Progress has been positive. Everything that happened in the past has stayed there, at least so far.\n\nNadal has built up 13 hours of preparation on court...\n\nThis time he's quite a way further back than on other occasions. That's why he's practising longer hours than normal. We've had to accelerate his preparations with more time on court. It's something we don't like doing, but in the end we have to adapt to what we think Rafa needs. And that's the way it is this time.\n\nAnd against tough opponents.\n\nThat has often been the case. When we've come to Roland Garros, he's practised against Zverev, Tsitsipas, etc., on the days leading up to his opener. It's true that we've also ramped up in that regard. Looking for first opponents that give him more rhythm, that allow him to find form without killing him, so to speak. Then, according to how the week has progressed, we've been more demanding in that regard too. It's all part of a process. At least we're seeing him enjoy himself in practice, something that wasn't happening months ago.\n\nWere you following the draw on Friday?\n\nThey sent me messages, we weren't following it.\n\nThat was bad luck.\n\nOf course, it's one of the worst opponents he could get [Zverev]. He's coming in in great shape, no injuries and confident. And he just won in Rome. It was always something that could happen. Considering the fact that Rafa is unseeded, the draws have been kind until now, fair. This time it was the worst that could happen. We were hoping for a draw that would allow him to find his rhythm and confidence gradually. But the circumstances are different. We got Zverev and we have to approach it in the best way possible.\n\nHe is raring to go, and has a very positive attitude. For our part, we know where we are and who we're with. You hold onto that. It's going to be a very tough, well-fought match. If Rafa can play at the level he has been in practice... why not think positive?\n\nIf you had to choose: Zverev in Round 1or Zverev in Round 3?\n\nAs deep as possible. That would mean Rafa would have won matches and he would have momentum. I don't think it's positive playing Zverev in the first round, honestly. We have to be honest and say things as they are.\n\nWhat has been the biggest challenge since the operation?\n\nThe main challenge was trying to be competitive again. That's been an uncertainty for Rafa since the operation. In Brisbane we saw a version that could have been close to that. It's true that it was in best-of-three matches, and against opponents that weren't among the best. We saw a good Nadal there. Then more problems came, many day-to-day problems that ate away at his morale, leading him to have difficult thoughts.\n\nCan you expand on that?\n\nThis time it was a jigsaw with a lot of pieces out of place. We've tried to reorganise them little by little. We were unable to train as often as we wanted, with problems in many movements and shots. He's never been free to play without thinking that he could hurt himself or feeling limited. As he couldn't practise a lot of things, there were things missing. Some of the pain went away, but it was replaced by other pains. Every day was a new challenge, more pieces out of place.\n\nWhat about now?\n\nNow it seems like, for the first time, the pieces are starting to be in the right place and that he can play with peace of mind, with the instinctiveness he was lacking a few months ago. The challenge was to rearrange the puzzle, which was a mess from top to bottom. We believe everything is now in the right place.\n\nIt's Nadal and it's Roland Garros. Is he here to win the tournament, or does he believe playing a part is acceptable?\n\nThere will be no holding back now. Rafa will play to the death, at 100 per cent, giving his all. We're in a new situation: five-set matches. He hasn't done that for two years, but we think he's ready.\n\nThere's no more risk than there was in Brisbane or any other tournament. If something happens to him it's not for a lack of practice or matches. It will be because of an exertion that his body hasn't been able to cope with, but we're confident nothing should happen.", "source": {"uri": "atptour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ATP Tour"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour_Masters_1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour Masters 1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brisbane"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2024/05/25/17/29/nadal-moya-roland-garros-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nAfter the heartbreaking first round exit on Monday, Rafael Nadal's record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end when the 14-time champion slumped to a straight sets defeat against Alexander Zverev. He later revealed his journey to the Paris Olympics in July will not take a detour to Wimbledon.\n\nNadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 3-6, 6-7 (5), 3-6 in the first round to Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut.\n\nIt was the first time he had been defeated in the first round at the French Open and again prompted questions over his long-term future.\n\nNadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July.\n\nNadal, a gold medallist in singles and doubles at 2008 and 2016 Olympics in Beijing and Rio de Janeiro respectively, told reporters: \"That's my main goal now.\n\n\"I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\"\n\nWhat is the qualification criteria for the Olympics?\n\nUnlike many other sports which run qualifiers and trials for the Olympics, tennis selects its contenders based on the rankings. The ATP and WTA rankings on 10 June, day after the French Open ends, will be used to determine direct acceptances into the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nBut that isn't alone to decide the criteria. In order to be eligible to compete in the Olympics, players have to:\n\n- be in good standing with their National Association and the International Tennis Federation (ITF)\n\n- Should have represented their country in the team events - Davis Cup (for men) or Billie Jean King Cup (for women)\n\n- Aged 14 or over for men, 15 or over for women\n\nEach country can nominate a maximum of 12 players - six men and six women. The singles event at the Olympics features 64 players with a maximum of four athletes per country.\n\nThere are 56 direct acceptances into the singles draw based on the rankings on the cutoff date of 10 June. This means the 56 highest ranked ATP and WTA players, keeping in mind the maximum of four players per nation limitation, will be offered a place.\n\nBeyond this, there are six final qualification places. It is handed out to continental champions, gold medallists from previous Olympics, Grand Slam champions and for the hosts (if needed).\n\nNadal's case, however, falls under the Protected/Special Rankings. Ranked 275 in the world, Nadal is well behind fellow Spaniards Carlos Alcaraz (World No 3), Alejandro Davidovich Fokina (World No 32), Pedro Martinez (World No 48) and Roberto Carballes Baena (World No 63) as the four representatives from his country.\n\nThe veteran could use his Protected Ranking to ensure he features among the four players from Spain. He would, however, also need to apply for an exemption from the ITF for not playing the Davis Cup since 2019. These factors along with his lengthy time out with injury, Olympic and Davis Cup records would make him liable for a special inclusion.\n\nIt is still possible for Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz to play doubles at the Paris Olympics based on the 21-year-old's top-10 ranking in singles.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Tennis_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Tennis Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Davidovich_Fokina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alejandro Davidovich Fokina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carball\u00e9s_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberto Carball\u00e9s Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Tennis_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Tennis Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Rafael-Nadal-RG-AP-1200-2024-05-ff806382682e73c7466eee38023985d5.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1302, "textEnd": 1309, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 428, "textEnd": 434}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

There have been first-time Major winners aplenty, and dominance has tended to be surface specific. It's been a far cry from the men's tour, where members of the Big Three have continued to rule the roost.\n\nHowever, heading into the French Open, it finally feels like the dawn of a new era beckons in men's tennis as well. While Roger Federer's career ground to a halt in 2022, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic went on to win nine of the 13 Majors between them over the last three years. But now, with Nadal struggling to find his best and Djokovic's shocking dip in form, there's no real favourite for the men's singles title at a Grand Slam for the first time in 20 years.\n\nThat this likely change of guard could happen at Roland Garros makes it all the more astonishing, for it is one Slam that had the clearest favourite for the better part of this century. But Nadal and Djokovic's troubles are only half the story. The draw this time is wide open also because of how the other contenders have fared in recent months.\n\n\"Right now, I don't see a clear favourite to win the tournament, but there is a wide range of players who can do it,\" Carlos Alcaraz said in his pre-tournament press conference. The Spanish world No.3 has been touted as the next big thing on clay since last year, when he defended his titles in Madrid and Barcelona, but he's had to cope with a right forearm injury since winning at Indian Wells in March.\n\nThere's no denying that when fit, Alcaraz can thrive on clay with his speed, power and creativity. But there's a big question mark over his preparation this time as it's been more than a month since he played competitively. Among the build-up tournaments for Roland Garros, he only competed in Madrid and lost in the quarter-finals to Andrey Rublev.\n\n\"Honestly, I came here with not as many matches as I wanted, but I'm focusing on the practice,\" said Alcaraz, who won Wimbledon in 2023 and the US Open the year before that. \"I don't think I need too many matches to get my 100 percent. I'm not feeling any pain in the practices when I step on the court. But I'm still thinking about it when I am hitting forehands. Probably I'm gonna say I'm a little bit scared about hitting every forehand 100 percent. So, I have to change it in my first match.\"\n\nItalian Jannik Sinner, the other next-gen star, finds himself in a similarly uncertain boat. It's fair to say that clay has been the weakest surface in his young career as he's won just one title on it (Umag, 2022), but his confidence and reputation grew a great deal this year with some fine performances.\n\nThe 22-year-old had his breakthrough Grand Slam win at the Australian Open, following that up by winning the Rotterdam and Miami titles. He then reached the semi-finals in Monte Carlo and the quarters in Madrid, but has been hampered by a right hip injury since. The Italian, who skipped his home Masters in Rome, said his hip feels good now and the last tests he did were positive.\n\n\"For sure, the general physical shape is not where I want it to be, but we cannot make miracles happen in less than 10 days before the first round,\" said Sinner. \"Most importantly, it's going to be the mental side. Of being mentally ready and accepting things that could happen on the court, and then we'll see what I can do.\"\n\nAmong the other hopefuls are Casper Ruud, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev. Ruud has been a consistent performer on clay, having reached the French Open final the last two years, and won 10 of his 11 career titles on the red dirt. Tsitsipas too has been a Roland Garros runner-up (2021), and he won the Monte Carlo title this year. Zverev, who reached the semi-finals in Paris the last three years, will be high on confidence after last week's Italian Open triumph. The German will feature in the marquee first-round clash as he faces Nadal on Monday.\n\nAlthough there are several contenders, there is no clear favourite. And that makes this year's French Open a fascinating prospect.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole two weeks of preparation.\"\n\nThere was no specially-arranged farewell presentation for the 22-time major winner on his request.\n\nYet the sight of so many active stars, including his biggest rivals, in the stands was, in a way, its own tribute.\n\nThe whole Nadal clan were in attendance, too, with a debut appearance for son Rafael Junior, who was born in October 2022.\n\nThe travelling party also included grey-haired uncle Miguel, 57, whose penalty for Spain was saved by England goalkeeper David Seaman in the quarter-final shootout of Euro 96 at Wembley.\n\nManchester City star Rodri, fresh from the FA Cup final defeat, had managed to nab a ticket to watch his fellow compatriot and joined in with the morale-boosting chants of Rafa.\n\nThis was Nadal's fourth defeat in 116 matches here and the first time he has exited from the first round as he sent a forehand wide and long.\n\nHis Roland Garros record is one of the most astonishing ever witnessed in professional sport and it is unlikely his dominance will be replicated.\n\nThere is already a statue of him in full flow next to the main arena and it will act as a reminder for future generations just how exceptional he was on this surface.\n\nNadal continued: \"Today the feeling I have is difficult to describe in words.\n\n\"For me, it's special to feel the love of the people in the place I love the most.\n\n\"I have been going through a tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be here at Roland Garros.\n\n\"The first round hasn't been the ideal one. I have to say I needed something else, I was competitive, I had my chances but it was not enough against a great player.\n\n\"It's difficult to say what happens in the future. It's a big percentage that I will not be back here. I cannot say 100%. I am having fun, the body is feeling better than two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say, it's enough. I cannot give anything else. I don't feel it yet.\n\n\"I have goals in front of me. I hope to be back for the Olympics. That motivates me. I hope to be well prepared.\n\n\"It has been a very beautiful process, all the memories, every single year were different, but not less special. Unforgettable feelings.

before his eventual retirement in 2015.\n\nWe look back at the career of the man who permanently etched his name into tennis history thanks to his Paris exploits.\n\nBefore his most famous win, Soderling had achieved a solid level of success - but was not a name known outside of hardcore tennis fans.\n\nThe Swede had won three career titles and reached a further six finals, but had never made it to the second week of a Slam.\n\nAfter finishing 2008 as the world No 17 - his highest year-end ranking to that point - Soderling had dropped down to be the 23rd seed at Roland Garros in 2009.\n\nAnd there the 24-year-old reached the second week of a Slam for the first time, upsetting 14th seed and future finalist David Ferrer in round three.\n\nBut no one fancied his chances against world No 1 Nadal in round four, with the Spaniard a perfect 31-0 in matches at the tournament.\n\nIn terms of rankings, there have been bigger shocks in tennis.\n\nBut Nadal's dominant Roland Garros career up until that point - and general dominance on clay throughout his career - makes what Soderling did on May 31st, 2009 a truly seismic moment.\n\nEyebrows were well and truly raised when the Swede raced to the first set, winning it for the loss of just two games, though it seemed like order had been restored when Nadal won set two in a tiebreak.\n\nHowever, that was as good as it got for the King of Clay on this occasion.\n\nSoderling responded with a strong third set and, after a nailbiting fourth set, closed out a stunning 6-2, 6-7(2), 6-4, 7-6(2) triumph.\n\nWhat made Soderling's win even more impressive is that he went on to play the best tennis of his career across the following two years.\n\nThe Swede reached his first Grand Slam final that tournament, backing up his Nadal win by defeating Nikolay Davydenko and Fernando Gonzalez - before losing to Roger Federer in the final.\n\nImpressively, he returned to the final 12 months later, beating Federer in the last eight before a straight-sets final loss to Nadal; lightning rarely strikes twice, particularly when concerning Nadal on the dirt.\n\nHowever, it wasn't just in Paris he found success.\n\nLater in 2009 he won his fourth career title at the Swedish Open, reached a US Open quarter-final, and qualified for the ATP Finals - reaching the last four and sealing a year-end ranking of eighth.\n\nThe 2010 season saw him not only reach a second Roland Garros final, but also Wimbledon and US Open quarter-finals, finishing runner-up at three tournaments and winning two titles - including the Paris Masters.\n\nSoderling ended 2010 as the world No 5 and was in impressive form again in 2011, winning four titles from as many finals and reaching another French Open quarter-final up until July of that season.\n\nAfter winning the 10th and final title of his career at the Swedish Open, Soderling was initially forced to withdraw from the Canada Open and Cincinnati Masters due to a wrist injury.\n\nBut while rehabbing that issue, he fell ill and was forced to withdraw from his US Open round one clash after being diagnosed with mononucleosis.\n\nSadly, Soderling was never able to play another professional tennis match.\n\nA slow recovery from his illness meant that he was never able to regain full fitness, and he would later detail his struggle with panic attacks and his mental health.\n\nIn December 2015, four years after his last match, Soderling announced his retirement from tennis aged 31; he had been a month shy of his 27th birthday when he last played.\n\nDespite his playing career ending earlier than expected, he has continued to influence the sport.\n\nWhile still an inactive player, he launched a clothing brand - RS-Tennis - while he also briefly worked as the Stockholm Open tournament director.\n\nHe also previously coached compatriot Elias Ymer, while he served as Sweden's Davis Cup captain from 2021 to 2023.\n\nSoderling's career may have been unexpectedly short, but it was certainly sweet - and few will forget what he was able to do at Roland Garros 15 years ago.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_S\u00f6derling", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robin S\u00f6derling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Davydenko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikolay Davydenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swedish Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Ferrer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ATP Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elias_Ymer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elias Ymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stockholm Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Davis Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F28164705%2FRobin-Soderling.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-31", "textStart": 1705, "textEnd": 1719}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 613, "textEnd": 622}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-12-", "textStart": 3943, "textEnd": 3956}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Rafa arrived in Paris with a protected ranking, and the draw did not favor him, facing the Rome Masters winner already in the first match!\n\nNadal embraced fine training sessions in Paris, feeling much better than in Rome, where he described his performance as a disaster! The ten-time champion at Foro Italico scored one victory at one of his favorite events before suffering a heavy loss against a top-10 rival.\n\nNadal met the Belgian Zizou Bergs in the first round and notched a hard-fought 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 triumph in two hours and 53 minutes. Thus, Rafa celebrated his 70th victory in the Italian capital, achieving a notable milestone.\n\nBergs fought well, overcoming a 3-1 deficit in the opener and clinching it to move in front. Nadal raised his level in sets two and three, serving well and delivering a break in each to emerge at the top.\n\nRafa fired 19 service winners, but his groundstrokes could have worked better.\n\nHe sprayed 32 mistakes and welcomed 36 from his rival to seal the deal. Nadal claimed three points more than his rival, falling behind in the mid-range exchanges and overcoming the deficit in the shortest and most advanced rallies.\n\nThe veteran denied seven out of nine break points and notched three breaks, passing the first obstacle and setting the clash against Hubert Hurkacz. Nadal did not look well against a better-ranked rival, suffering a heavy 6-1, 6-3 loss and ending his campaign.\n\nThe Spaniard did not have much left in the tank following that three-hour battle two days earlier, struggling on serve and return and playing miles below his best. Thus, the king of clay suffered one of the most brutal losses on his beloved surface, hoping for a better run in Paris.\n\nHe has struggled to improve his physical shape but will extend his career beyond 2024 if possible.\n\nHurkacz landed in 54% of the first serve. However, it did not cost him much after passing an initial struggle, defending all seven break points and keeping the pressure on the other side. Nadal served at 72% but drew nothing from that, failing to impose service winners or dictate the pace in the exchanges.\n\nRafa gave away almost half of the points in his games and got broken four times. Hubert controlled his strokes nicely, hitting 23 winners and ten unforced errors. Also, he added 22 service winners and outplayed Rafa from the baseline, welcoming 20 unforced errors from the Spaniard, mainly from his forehand.\n\nNadal fought well in the mid-range and most extended rallies. Still, he stood miles behind in the shortest exchanges up to four strokes, landing only eight service winners and struggling to embrace his patterns.\n\nRafa made a promising start and created five break chances in the first game of the encounter.\n\nHubert stayed focused and saved them, avoiding an early setback and closing the game with a service winner. After missing his chances, Nadal faced two break points in the second game, saving them and locking the result at 1-1 after 27 minutes of grueling tennis!\n\nThe Pole produced a hold at love in the third game and stepped in on the return in the next one. He created a break chance and seized it after the Spaniard's loose drop shot, forging the advantage and moving 3-1 in front. Hubert cemented the lead with a hold in game five and made another push on the return in the next one.\n\nNadal played more loose strokes and sprayed another drop shot mistake, losing serve and falling 5-1 behind. Hurkacz served for the opening set in the seventh game and offered Nadal two break points.\n\nThe Pole saved them and closed the set after the Spaniard's forced error, opening a 6-1 advantage after 49 minutes.\n\nCarried by this boost, Hurkacz dropped one point behind the initial shot in the second set, forcing Nadal to follow that pace to stay in touch. Rafa closed the first game after a deuce and faced issues at 1-1. He offered Hubert a break point after a backhand mistake and fell behind after the rival's lucky net cord forehand down the line winner.\n\nThe Pole held at love in the next one with a service winner for 3-1, looking good to bring the victory home from there. They served well in the next four games, with Hubert moving 5-3 in front. Rafa served to stay in the match in game nine and suffered another break after spraying a forehand error, sending his rival over the top and experiencing a heavy loss.\n\n\"The Rome Masters turned into a disaster for me after I lost 6-1, 6-3. I feel better now, both mentally and physically. I have had one of the worst possible draws. It does not help, but I will do my best,\" Rafael Nadal said.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jovica_ilic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Jovica Ilic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foro_Italico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foro Italico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizou_Bergs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zizou Bergs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drop shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149218.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nThis assault case follows previous abuse allegations against Zverev from his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova, who accused the German star of punching her in the face and covering her face with a pillow, leaving her \"scared for [her]\n\nIn the wake of the allegations, Zverev faced public criticism after he was elected to an ATP advisory council in January. U.S. tennis star Sloane Stephens told reporters at the time a women's star facing similar charges would not have been elected to the WTA player council, while Iga Swiatek, the No. 1 women's player, told reporters \"it's not good when a player who's facing charges like that is kind of being promoted.\"\n\nZverev starred in an episode of Netflix' since-canceled docuseries \"Break Point\" last year dedicated to his recovery from an ankle ligament tear and a surgery that sidelined the German star for months. Controversially, the episode never mentioned the allegations against Zverev. The show was canceled in March.\n\nNadal, regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time, has 92 singles titles to his name and holds the record as the winningest player in men's singles competition at the French Open, though this year he entered the tournament unseeded following a string of injuries that kept him sidelined for months. He last won the French Open in 2022, defeating Zverev in the semifinals, when Zverev stumbled and injured his ankle so badly he left the court in a wheelchair and was sidelined from the sport for months.\n\nZverev's next match is scheduled for Wednesday against the winner of the first-round match between Germany's David Goffin and France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.\n\nOver $2.6 million. That's how much the winner of the men's singles competition at the French Open will take home as a grand prize (roughly 2.4 million Euros).\n\nZverev broke onto the international tennis scene as a 20-year-old in 2017, defeating three-time French Open winner Novak Djokovic at the 2017 Italian Open and Swiss star Roger Federer at the Rogers Cup that same year. In 2018, he was named on Forbes Europe's 30 Under 30 in Entertainment, along with artist Dua Lipa, actress Millie Bobby Brown and actor Daniel Kaluuya.

Rafa's trademark tenacity, fortitude, muscular shotmaking, and indomitable will were on regular display -- they just weren't on consistent display. Against a focused and on-point Alexander Zverev, occasional brilliance wasn't enough, and -- thanks largely to an unfortunate draw that had him face off against the tournament's number-four seed in the first round -- Nadal lost the match 6-3, 7-6, 6-3.\n\nRafa had his chances, with multiple service breaks, breathtaking winners, and a close set-deciding tiebreak, but at the same time -- barring the eternal possibility of the sort of five-set gut-wrenching upset that Nadal in his prime wielded as a calling card -- Zverev seemed to be on the kind of glide path that the very pro-Rafa crowd at Court Philippe-Chatrier in Paris (which included Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek) feared.\n\nWill we ever see him play at Roland-Garros again? In the weeks leading up to the tournament, it seemed a fait accompli that this would be his last go-round at the French, if not the capstone match of his entire career -- a career that saw him develop into the greatest player ever to dominate a single surface (clay) or a single tournament (the French, which he won a record 14 times), en route to becoming one of the greatest players to ever play the game of tennis. (He's won 22 Grand Slams, second only to Djokovic's 24.) Just how dominant has Rafa been on the terre battue of Roland-Garros? In one statistic: today's loss to Zverev was just his fourth loss here in his career. (After the match, Coco Gauff -- who cruised to a win in her first-round match -- gushed about Nadal: \"Everything about him -- I think his aura is one of one, and something that will never happen again in this sport.\")", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6654bdfa10860dd551e779ec/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-2154897251.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Nadal has already said in the on-court interview that his immediate future will always be in Paris, for the Olympic tournament. Rafa, who left a glimmer of hope for a possible come back at the Roland Garros, was also honored by many colleagues such as Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz, who flocked to the Philippe Chatrier to pay homage to the Spanish champion, in what could be the his farewell at the Parisian Slam. But who knows what the future holds...\n\nA decision that seems to have already been made will make many of his fans sad: Nadal should skip Wimbledon. According to Tennis Major account and as reported by The Tennis Letter, the Spaniard confirmed at the press conference that he will probably skip the Championships, to focus on the Olympics.\n\n\"It seems difficult for me now to switch to grass and have the Olympics to play on clay immediately after. I have to analyze but I don't think it would be smart after everything that happened to my body,\" explained Rafa.\n\nAt the press conference after the match against Zverev, Rafa touched on also many other topics: from injuries to his level of play. And so on.\n\n\"It was a tough process in every sense, and I got to a point where I was mentally destroyed, you know, in terms of energy, in terms of personal happiness. That's why I said, okay, I've got to finish this. At least I got to play four tournaments. This means a lot to me, and let's see. I don't need to talk about how hard everything was, because if we balance all the things that have happened in my tennis career, in my life, the positive moments are incredibly much heavier. Thanks to tennis, I have had experiences that I could never have imagined without practicing, playing this beautiful sport, and I have been much more successful than I could have ever dreamed. I've had hard times and lows, yes. But on the other hand I have had incredible emotional and positive moments that I am so grateful for and I feel very lucky about it all.\n\nI'm a simple guy through and through, aren't I? For me, as I have always said, for me the feeling of returning home with the personal satisfaction of doing everything I have in my hands to make things work well, giving myself everything, just in this way I understand my life, you know. That's why I'm not saying I'm retiring today. Ultimately, it's about not feeling like, for a year or a year and a half, that I didn't give myself a chance, a real chance, you know, because right after I started getting a little healthier, I stopped. So in terms of what drives me, what is the force that drives me, I mean, like I said, I'm a simple guy. I like what I do. You know, I'm passionate about sports, I'm passionate about competition. I like to train, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different place in my personal life too, I'm traveling with my son, my wife, you know. I'm enjoying these moments that won't come back.\n\nSo if I continue to enjoy doing what I'm doing and feel competitive and healthy enough to enjoy it, I want to keep going for a while. I don't know how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they're having fun, I'm having fun, and I need to see, I need to give myself a little more chance to see if my level is growing up and my body is holding up, so let's make a decision. But give me two months until the Olympics, and then let's see if I can move forward or say, okay, guys, that's more than enough. We see. I mean, today is not the time to analyze all this kind of stuff. It's a good time to move forward, accept the moment and see what's happening,\" analyzed Rafa.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Alcaraz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Alcaraz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

First of all, thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. It's such a great honor,\" Zverev said in his on-court interview. \"I've watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Today is not my moment, it's Rafa's moment, so thank you.\"\n\nZverev becomes just the third player to defeat Nadal at Roland Garros, joining Novak Djokovic (twice) and Robin Soderling. Nadal, who fell to 112-4 on the clay in France, owns 22 Grand Slam titles but missed last year's French Open dealing with injuries.\n\n\"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know if it's going to be the last time that I'm going to be here in front of all of you, honestly,\" Nadal said. \"I am not 100 percent sure, but if it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\n\n\"The crowd has been amazing during the whole week of preparation and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words. But for me, it's so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most.\"\n\nIn other action Monday, No. 2 seed Jannik Sinner of Italy defeated Christopher Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, while No. 5 Daniil Medvedev of Russia outlasted Germany's Dominik Koepfer 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3. Ninth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece advanced in straight sets over Hungary's Marton Fucsovics, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-1.\n\nA trio of seeded Americans opened with victories. No. 14 Tommy Paul swept Argentina's Pedro Cachin 6-2, 6-3, 6-1, while No. 25 Frances Tiafoe was down a set before beating Italy's Mattia Bellucci 6-3, 3-6, 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-4. No. 15 Ben Shelton dropped the opening set to fan favorite Hugo Gaston of France before prevailing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.\n\n\"I love these moments. I enjoy these atmospheres,\" Shelton said. \"I got a lot of heckling when I was in college tennis, but today the crowd was just loud, chanting, supporting their countryman. It's something that you love to see. There was a lot of positive out there.\"\n\nNo. 18 seed Karen Khachanov of Russia, No. 21 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada, No. 23 Francisco Cerundolo and No. 30 Lorenzo Musetti of Italy all advanced in straight sets.\n\nNo. 20 seed Sebastian Baez of Argentina survived a five-set challenge from Brazilian qualifier Gustavo Heide and won 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3, but two other seeded players weren't as fortunate. Matteo Arnaldi of Italy upset No. 29 Arthur Fils of France 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, and Russian Pavel Kotov took down No. 32 Cameron Norrie of Great Britain 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2.\n\nGerman qualifier Henri Squire beat Australia's Max Purcell 6-2, 6-2, 3-6, 4-6, 7-6 (10) to advance.\n\nOther first-round winners included South Korea's Soonwoo Kwon, Slovakia's Jozef Kovalik, Kazakhstan's Alexander

However, despite this, Nadal is unwilling to confirm his retirement date.\n\nNadal's first Wimbledon triumph in 2008 was an all-time five-set classic, as he beat Roger Federer in fading light for his first major outside of Paris.\n\nHe had previously lost to Federer in two consecutive finals and the last time he lost a match he completed at Wimbledon was indeed to the now-retired Swiss legend, in 2019.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grass court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Lawn_Tennis_and_Croquet_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Kyrgios", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Kyrgios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roger Federer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_us_sports_articles_270/eeaa321b90f92b00321060b7b70df2be", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

'We know each other. We never played. We practised so many times. [She's a] nice, nice girl - I think that's important, but [she is also a] very tough one.\n\nBadosa is making her return to the French Open after missing the 2023 tournament with injury\n\nShe takes on British No 1 Katie Boulter in the first round, with the 26th seed picking up a first WTA 500 event title in March\n\n'She had a very good start of the year. She's been playing also an entire year to be a little different than me, but I'm feeling good. I'm feeling motivated for the match. It's going to be a tough one, but I like this kind of battle.'\n\nRead More Top Spin 2K25 review: After a 13-year hiatus the popular tennis gaming franchise is back, providing a smash hit for familiar players and newcomers\n\nIt has been a tough period for Badosa, who rocketed to World No 2 in April 2022 before struggling with injury during large portions of 2023, notably suffering a stress fracture in her lower back.\n\nShe was forced to retire in the second round of last year's Wimbledon tournament, her only appearance at the four slams of 2023, but has started the 2024 season well, reaching the third round in Melbourne at the Australian Open.\n\n'I'm looking to come back stronger, step by step. I've been feeling good this past two weeks. That's important for me, but it's a process. It's a process because it's not an easy injury.\n\n'But for the moment, I'm feeling pretty good. And the most important that I'm excited again, emotionally I'm okay, and I think if that's okay, the rest will come.'\n\nNow, ranked 140 in the WTA standings, Badosa returns to Roland Garros where she has a 75 per cent win rate looking to continue that return to her best form on conditions that she knows suit her game.\n\nBack in 2021 the Spaniard made it to the quarter finals, her highest ever finish at a slam.\n\n'I grew up in this surface. I like the conditions here it's pretty bouncy. Also, I like to play with spin, pretty fast at the same time.\n\nBadosa was speaking courtesy of Top Spin 2K25, the fifth instalment of the popular tennis video game franchise\n\nBadosa has a terrific record at the French Open, where she reached a personal best quarter-final finish at the grand slams in 2021\n\n'I feel comfortable here. I like to play here. I like the courts, the conditions. So maybe that's a little bit the reason.'\n\nRead More French Open great Rafael Nadal refuses to rule out a Roland Garros return in 2025... as 14-time champion insists 'I'm not ready to go just yet'\n\nBadosa's record at Roland Garros is impressive, but there is none for whom the clay courts in the French capital have been a happy hunting ground more so than Rafael Nadal.\n\nThe Spanish icon - who many would argue has the strongest claim to being the greatest to ever pick up a tennis racket - has not ruled out a return to the iconic courts next year, but is expected to retire later this season.\n\nHe isn't called the King of Clay for nothing. Losing just three of his 155 matches at Roland Garros, Nadal returns on Monday against Alexander Zverev in an extremely tough draw against one of the contenders to go all the way.\n\nHis statistics at the French Open alone read like an extremely one-sided game of Top Trumps.\n\nOn three occasions he has gone at least four years unbeaten in Paris, he has never lost a final - nor has he dropped more than a set in doing so - and has the highest win percentage of any player, at any grand slam in history (97.4 per cent).\n\nWith a scarcely believable 14 titles to his name at the French Open, the first of those coming at 19 on his first attempt, Badosa believes that Roland Garros perhaps ought to be re-named in honour of its greatest ever participant.\n\n'Rafa Nadal was a big idol of mine and the woman's side, Maria Sharapova also,' Badosa admits.

On the job just two weeks, Marsch will receive a baptism by fire with away friendlies against seventh ranked Netherlands on June 6 followed by number two France three days later with Lionel Messi and top ranked Argentina waiting to take on Canada in their Copa America opener on June 20 in Atlanta.\n\nTennis-Paris darling Nadal exits French Open in farewell-like defeat\n\nRafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday.\n\nTennis - Nadal says Olympics main goal after early Roland Garros defeat\n\nRafa Nadal likened his struggles with injury in the last 18 months to being in a jungle as the 14-times French Open champion hoped to return to Roland Garros for the Olympic Games after making a premature exit from the Grand Slam on Monday. Never far from physical issues in his glittering career, the 37-year-old missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major.\n\nAthletics-Suriname's Asinga gets four-year ban for doping\n\nThe Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has suspended sprinter Issamade Asinga for four years for a doping violation, stripping him of two South American Championship gold medals as well as his Under-20 100 metres world record. Asinga, 19, who represents Suriname, was provisionally suspended in August after testing positive for prohibited metabolites during an out-of-competition test, a month after he set his junior world record of 9.89 seconds.\n\nBill Walton, NBA Hall of Famer and free spirit, dead at 71\n\nBill Walton, a two-time NBA champion and member of the basketball Hall of Fame, whose brilliant but injury-riddled career led to a second act as a free-spirited broadcaster who waxed philosophical on the air, died on Monday at the age of 71, the National Basketball Association announced. Walton, who had a prolonged battle with cancer, was surrounded by his family when he died, the National Basketball Association said.\n\nMotor racing-Newgarden wins back-to-back Indy 500s as scandal lingers\n\nJosef Newgarden won a final lap duel with Pato O'Ward to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 22-years on Sunday, team owner Roger Penske's 20th win of the \"Greatest Spectacle in Racing\" coming with a whiff of scandal. Newgarden's victory capped an eventful afternoon at the Brickyard that saw the start delayed four hours due to severe storms and the race interrupted by multiple cautions.\n\nCeltics complete sweep of Pacers, punch ticket to Finals\n\nDerrick White had missed 7 of 8 3-point attempts when he found himself open in the right corner of the floor in the final minute of a tie game with an NBA Finals berth at stake. He watched Jaylen Brown handle the ball and was just waiting for his Boston Celtics teammate to deliver a pass. Once Brown did just that, it was White's turn to make a play.\n\nTennis-Djokovic doubters await as title defence begins at Roland Garros\n\nWorld number one Novak Djokovic will be the main attraction at Roland Garros on Tuesday when he begins his French Open title defence against Pierre-Hugues Herbert, but after last year's domination, this year brings less expectation.

Loud chants of \"Hugo, Hugo\" echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton's fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter.\n\nMLB roundup: Rockies break Guardians' 9-game win streak\n\nCharlie Blackmon homered, doubled twice and drove in four runs and the Colorado Rockies used a six-run fourth inning to beat the red-hot Cleveland Guardians 8-6 in Denver on Monday.

Nadal's uncles, Miguel \u00c1ngel and former coach Toni, will tee off alongside the 22-time Grand Slam champion.\n\nAmong those flying the flag for France will be former World Cup winner Alain Boghossian, while Danish businessman Flemming \u00d8stergaard - former chairman of the company that owns FC Copenhagen - is also expected to appear. A host of Italian ex-footballers, including former AC Milan stars Mauro Tassotti, Roberto Donadoni and Stefano Nava, bolster the soccer contingent.\n\nNadal's passion for golf is looks set to see him commit more time to the sport when his tennis career comes to an end.\n\n\"I just love the game of golf,\" said Nadal in an interview in 2022. \"It is very different to tennis, but also the same in some ways. You have to control your mentality to succeed in both sports.\"\n\nNadal's long-time tennis rival Novak Djokovic is also a passionate golf player and impressed fans with his skills when he played in a Pro-Am event prior to last year's Ryder Cup.\n\n\"When I got an invite, I was like, 'Oh my god. I gotta accept this...' I got a bit prepared,\" said Djokovic as he looked back on his experience in Italy last September.\n\n\"I thought I can't hit someone in the head... because we don't want that. I have no insurance!\n\n\"Then I started to ask questions about who was competing and I wanted to know their handicap. And I started to train a bit more, I got lessons.\n\n\"When you become a father, you have less time. I haven't played much golf in the last six years. But I increased the amount of golf I've played in the last six months, especially in the last ten days.\"\n\nSports fans around the world have relished the rivalry between Nadal and Djokovic on tennis courts for the last two decades and maybe we will get a chance to see the pair go head-to-head on a golf course when their sporting careers end.\n\nThe end of Djokovic's tennis career is a topic that has been spoken about more frequently in recent months, as he has floundered in the opening half of 2024.\n\nYet it seems Nadal's final tennis match is edging closer after his exit at the French Open following a defeat against Alexander Zverev on Monday.\n\nNadal made what he suggested will probably be his final appearance at Roland Garros and admitted he doesn't know if he will return in 2024.\n\nHe is hoping to make a final appearance at the Roland Garros courts for this summer's Olympics and maybe then we will see more of Nadal on a golf course.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com",

The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.\"\n\nHe added: \"It's hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago.\n\n\"Maybe in two months I say it's enough. That is something I don't feel yet.\"\n\n\"I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.\"\n\nHe won't make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners.\n\nPlagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris.\n\n\"My body has been a jungle for two years.

Another day a tiger,\" said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury.\n\nIn his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams.

The young Spaniard did it showing a good physical form, after the after-effects of his forearm injury.\n\n\"These victories help a lot. The level I showed today was very high in every sense: tennis-wise, physically, when I moved on the court. I played intelligent tennis. I hit some forehands at 100%, I'm making progress under this aspect, although it is true that there have been some cases in which I have been a little aware that tennis is like that, you don't have to concentrate to hit all the shots 100%, you have to lower the intensity and know how to move the ball, to I say this that I played intelligent tennis. That's why, after a match like today, my confidence increases, my expectations increase a little, which makes me think I can get a good result here,\" he told at the press conference, expressing his feelings on the match played and focusing on the analysis of his forehand in relation to the forearm problem.\n\nThe journalists in the press room then asked him if Rafael Nadal's presence in Paris frees him from a certain amount of media attention.\n\n\"I didn't think about it, I didn't feel that way. Obviously, Rafa being here in Paris, which is his tournament, the spotlight will be on him, but I didn't notice less pressure whether he was in the tournament or not. I'm trying to move forward day by day, gaining confidence, since I haven't been on the court for many hours, but little by little I'm gaining confidence and that's the only thing on my mind at the moment,\" he explained.\n\nDespite having been out for 25 days due to the injury, the Spaniard already seemed very proactive on the court.\n\n\"I've already said that I'm a player who doesn't need many matches to get to 100%. As you all know, with four matches on clay I come here to a Grand Slam and I can play at a level like today. The training week also helps me a lot, to feel good and gain confidence. The days spent in Paris training with good players helped me a lot to realize the level I am at, the confidence I have and the level I can show,\" he analysed.\n\nAlready in the media day on the eve of the Parisian Slam, Alcaraz had shared the improvements since the injury, also expressing himself on Nadal and his rival Jannik Sinner.\n\n\"I feel better training after training. I can train and hit the ball without pain. It's a good start and I can't wait to play my first match at Roland Garros. This tournament is one of the main reasons why I train every day , so I want to improve as a player to win it. I arrive in Paris without playing the games I would have liked to play, but I don't think I need many to express my best level confidently.\"\n\n\"I know that this is a very special tournament for Rafael Nadal and it is a shame that this is his last participation. I want to enjoy his last tournament here and his tennis. Of course everything has an end. Would I have wanted to face Nadal in the first round? Honestly no! When I saw that there was a 50% chance of challenging him on his debut, I was grateful for how things went,\" said Alcaraz on his legendary countryman, before focusing on his main rivals in the second Slam of the season.\n\n\"I come from an injury and every opponent represents a threat for me. Jannik Sinner is having an incredible season. I wrote to him wishing him a speedy recovery in the last few weeks. It doesn't matter that he returned from an injury, because he always has the ability to play at a very high level and win the tournament.

Zverev is said to have \"briefly strangled his then-partner by the neck with both hands,\" causing her \"shortness of breath and considerable pain.\"\n\nThe document also emphasized that \"in view of the circumstances, it is expressly pointed out once again that the presumption of innocence applies until a final conviction.\"\n\nThe first thing to say is that Zverev himself is unlikely to be there. He is only required to attend court if the sole presiding judge requests him to do so, and that hasn't happened yet.\n\nThe court has currently set aside 10 days for the trial, which is open to the public, on dates in May, June and July. These coincide with two major tennis tournaments: the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nOn the opening day of the trial on May 31, Zverev's legal representatives will have the first opportunity to address the allegations. His ex-girlfriend, who has joined the proceedings as a co-plaintiff, is also scheduled to give her testimony.\n\nZverev has previously dismissed the allegations against him as \"complete bull***t\" and said that \"anybody that has semi-standard IQ levels knows what this is all about,\" without elaborating further.\n\nLast October, when the penalty order was issued, his lawyers, Schertz Bergmann, called the proceedings \"scandalous\" and claimed \"there can be no question of a fair trial.\"\n\nOn a media day ahead of the French Open, Zverev confirmed he had no plans to be present at the trial.\n\n\"I believe in the German system,\" he said. \"I do know what I did, I do know what I didn't do. That's, at the end of the day, what's going to come out, and I have to trust in that. I do believe that I'm not going to lose this procedure. There's absolutely no chance I am.\"\n\nZverev's decision to contest his penalty order comes with certain risks. The judge could indeed acquit him but -- in the case of a guilty verdict -- could equally impose a harsher punishment.\n\nAccording to the German Criminal Code, \"whoever physically assaults or damages the health of another person incurs a penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or a fine.\"\n\nBut while it remains legally possible for Zverev to receive a jail term, a court spokesperson told DW in January that this would be \"highly unlikely\" given the nature of the penalty order.\n\nThe judge's verdict may not be final, as it can be appealed by either side to a higher court.\n\nThe governing body of men's tennis, the ATP Tour, doesn't currently have a domestic abuse policy. This is in contrast to other sports, particularly in the United States.\n\nDespite this, the ATP's code of conduct states that a player can be suspended if they are \"charged with a violation of a criminal or civil law of any jurisdiction.\" So far, the ATP has chosen not to enforce this.\n\nThe French Open director, Amelie Mauresmo, told media in Paris on Sunday that \"as long as the trial isn't finished and there isn't a decision, he's considered innocent and so that's why he's allowed to be part of the draw.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zverev's sponsors -- with the exception of Rolex -- have stood by him and maintained their silence. However, if Zverev is found guilty, they, like the ATP, will come under further pressure to finally act.\n\nThis is not the first time Zverev has been accused of domestic abuse.\n\nIn social media posts and interviews in 2020 and 2021, another ex-girlfriend, Olya Sharypova, claimed he was violent towards her multiple times, in Monte Carlo, New York, Geneva and Shanghai. She said she feared for her life.\n\nHowever, Sharypova didn't press criminal charges, and in January 2023, the ATP closed its own investigation into the matter, citing \"insufficient evidence.\"\n\nWelcoming that decision at the time, Zverev said: \"From the beginning, I have maintained my innocence and denied the baseless allegations made against me.\"", "source": {"uri":

Luckily I can't tell you yet. It's good news. I don't think there's any need to organize a tribute on the pitch, everything will happen naturally with the crowd. It doesn't mean that I necessarily have to close the door to what may happen in the future.\"\n\nThese words shared by Rafael Nadal on the media day of the Roland Garros sparked the enthusiasm of the fans. The Spaniard has opened up to the possibility that this is not his last French Open; if he were to return to play there - for example - also in 2025, this would be a great gift for himself, for his fans and for all sports lovers. The Spaniard doesn't want to be forced to say that this will be his last Roland Garros. The message shared at the press conference says that the Spaniard will do everything to give himself at least another chance to compete next year, if his body gives positive responses. And in the next days we will have the firsts true answers about his physical form and the state of his body.\n\n\"A week ago in Rome I was a bit of a disaster, losing 6-1, 6-3. Now, however, I feel better in everything, even physically. I had one of the worst possible draws against Alexander Zverev, and that doesn't help,\" he added.\n\nFor Rafa, there were also excellent signs during training, where he won more than one set against tennis players of the caliber of Daniil Medvedev and Sebastian Korda.\n\n\"Training tells me I'm not that far away. I'm not a person who deludes myself: I have to improve, that's clear. But I was competitive in all the training sets played against excellent tennis players,\" he analyzed.\n\nThe responses received this week are positive and the 22-time Slam champion doesn't want to live with the regret of retiring, when he doesn't feel that time has come. And so, his fans' hopes of seeing him competitive again are growing, in what promises to be a very interesting edition of the Roland Garros.\n\n\"My body is responding well, better than I expected a month and a half ago. I'm not training with too much pain, the limitations I felt week after week, the ones that took away my hope of continuing, have diminished. If I continue like this, I can be competitive. I don't want to be left with doubts. Maybe in four days or a month I will get hurt again and I will decide that it is not worth it. Today the situation is different, but experience tells me that there are chances that something will happen again.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_ciotti@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Lorenzo Ciotti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Nadal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Nadal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Zverev", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Zverev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Korda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sebastian Korda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniil_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniil Medvedev"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149153.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9598845", "eventUri": "eng-9598845", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray were asked before and after their first-round matches if this would be their last French Open and both gave the same perfectly reasonable response: 'I don't know.'\n\nThis will drag on. Andy, will this be your last Wimbledon? Will you retire after the Olympics? Rafa, is this your last US Open? Last Laver Cup?\n\nThe French Open had to cancel a farewell ceremony for Nadal. Wherever he and Murray go now, will there be montages, banners, cakes, plaques and pinatas ready to be wheeled out or hurriedly packed away?\n\nThe most notorious example of this tomfoolery occurred at the Australian Open in 2019, when they read too much into Murray's comments and put on a retirement fiesta. Five years later and here he remains.\n\nWhy are we so determined to rush these all-time greats of the game into retirement?\n\nRafael Nadal and Andy Murray are bombarded with questions about retirement. Why are we so determined to rush these all-time greats?\n\nThey don't owe us anything and they are not damaging their legacies by soldiering on\n\nAs fans we want a chance to say farewell: to watch Nadal and Murray on court and know, for sure, that this is goodbye. But they don't owe us any explanation, or any clarity. They owe us precisely nothing.\n\nMaybe Nadal or Murray have an event in mind they would like to be their last but, more likely, they will continue to fight tooth and claw to squeeze every last drop from their careers.\n\nIt has been suggested that, by soldiering on and losing to players who they would have thrashed at their peak, these two are damaging their legacies -- what utter bilge. Former world No1 Andy Roddick said it right: 'This compromised version of Murray adds to his legacy. Seeing him struggle has brought the fans in.'\n\nTennis seems to be unique in this urge to hurry stars into their graves, perhaps because it is not a sport in which one can age gracefully.\n\nA footballer can become a bit-part player, supported by younger team-mates. Ageing golfers can tootle around, tip their cap and shuffle to the bar and no one bats an eyelid.\n\nTennis players are always going to be up against someone younger, stronger and fitter and that can be exposing. But for Murray and Nadal, the signs are they could be further away from retirement than was supposed a few weeks ago. Murray is enjoying his switch to a Yonex racket and Nadal feels as fit as he has for two years -- why on earth should they give up now?\n\nTennis seems unique in hurrying its heroes to the grave, but why on earth should they give up?\n\nNadal played well enough against Alexander Zverev to suggest that, with another few months of matches in his legs, he could become seriously competitive, at least on clay.\n\nCould he come back here next year? Absolutely yes. Could he earn a seeding and avoid another nightmarish draw? Quite possibly. Could he win a 15th French Open?

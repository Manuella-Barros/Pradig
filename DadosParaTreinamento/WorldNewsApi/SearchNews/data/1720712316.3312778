We have informed the BJP leadership and they have already told us to just wait for a few days, they will take remedial measures,\" Praful Patel told the media ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's oath-taking ceremony.Meanwhile, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed that the NCP had requested a cabinet minister's post. However, they were offered the position of minister of state with independent charge.Fadnavis further elaborated on the challenges of forming a government with an alliance, emphasizing that certain criteria need to be established and adhered to, considering the involvement of multiple parties. He said that the criteria cannot be altered to accommodate a single party's demands. \"When a government is formed with an alliance some criteria need to be decided, because several sides are together. But because of one party, the criteria cannot be twisted. But, I am sure that in the future when there will be an expansion at that time they will be remembered at that time. They requested for a cabinet minister post,\" Fadnavis said.The counting of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections was held on Tuesday. According to the Election Commission of India, the BJP won 240 seats, much lower than its 2019 tally of 303.The Congress, on the other hand, registered a strong growth, winning 99 seats. The INDIA bloc crossed the 230 mark, posing stiff competition, and defying all predictions.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has secured a third term, but the BJP will need to rely on the support of other parties in his coalition - JD (U) chief Nitish Kumar and TDP's chief Chandrababu Naidu.BJP fell 32 seats short of the 272 majority mark after votes polled in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections were counted. For the first time, since the Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power in 2014, it did not secure a majority on its own.

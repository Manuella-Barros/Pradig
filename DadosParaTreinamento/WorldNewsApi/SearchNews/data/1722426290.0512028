He spoke of a future in Belize that will look at tele-health, digital health and mental health. With a move in this direction, the government is looking to acquire a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank. Kevin Bernard, Minister of Health: \u201cIt\u2019s the digital health Madam Speaker. As you know the cornerstone of our government\u2019s initiative under the leadership of our Prime Minister is the digital transformation of this country and digital health is one of that initiative for the ministry. The future of healthcare Madam Speaker lies in the integration of digital technologies and under this component we aim to strengthen the Belize Health Information System, to develop a more comprehensive framework for telemedicine, starting with the pilot program, focused on mental health services. This will enable us, Madam Speaker, to provide essential mental health support to those in remote and underserved areas, breaking down the geographical barriers that have long hindered to access. In addition, Madam Speaker, we will fortify the digital infrastructure in the Northern Region, the Southern Region and the Palm View Centre. And by doing this, we will ensure that our healthcare facilities are equipped with advanced technology capable of delivering high quality care efficiently and effectively.\u201d Other areas in the health sector that Health Minister Bernard covered were human resources and infrastructure. With the brain drain phenomenon, there is a dire need for medical professionals. The government is looking to address this challenge by providing opportunities for Belizeans to study in the Caribbean. Kevin Bernard, Minister of Health: \u201cWe recognize that a well-trained healthcare workforce is the backbone of any robust health system. We will be sending a cohort of psychiatric nurse practitioners to pursue master\u2019s level training at the University of the West Indies. Additionally, we will provide advanced training in nursing administration and specialists in Neonatology, Gynecology, and Pediatrics. These initiatives, Madam Speaker, will enhance the skills of our healthcare workforce, ensuring that they are equipped to address a wide range of health issues with expertise and confidence. As I\u2019ve mentioned, another critical component, Madam Speaker, is mental health. It continues to be a critical area of focus. And so we plan to expand the Palm View Center by adding 20 more rooms, making it climate resilient and improving the ventilation of the center. This expansion will provide much needed space and a safer, more comfortable environment for our mental health patients and healthcare professionals as well working at the facility.\u201d Minister Bernard also noted that the government are currently conducting assessments at the Northern Regional Hospital, the Southern Regional Hospital and the Matron Roberts Polyclinic. These assessments are being done to enhance the climate resiliency at these facilities.", "summary": "Minister of Health and Wellness, Kevin Bernard rose in today\u2019s house meeting where he spoke on the future of the health sector.\u00a0 He spoke of a future in Belize that will look at tele-health, digital health and mental health.\u00a0 With a move in this direction, the government is looking to acquire a loan from the [&#8230;]", "url": "https://lovefm.com/minister-of-health-envisions-future-of-tele-health-and-digital-health-in-belize/", "image": "https://lovefm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/HEALTH-PLANS-min-300x169.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:04:31", "author": "Love Staff", "authors": ["Love Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "bz", "sentiment": 0.413}

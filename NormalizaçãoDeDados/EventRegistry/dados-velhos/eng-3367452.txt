Aluko's lawyers believe that the agreement she signed prevents her from speaking about it but the FA insists she is now free to talk about the facts of the case.\n\nThe Guardian can reveal that her complaint contained an allegation that Sampson made a remark with \"racial and prejudicial connotations\" whereby he asked a mixed race player how many times she had been in trouble with the police.\n\n\"During a meeting with the midfielders' unit of players, of which I was not present, MS [Sampson] used an analogy about pressing hard in midfield and getting a caution like a police caution,\" Aluko's evidence states. \"MS then addressed the player individually and said in relation to being cautioned by police: 'Haven't you been arrested before? Four times isn't it?'\"\n\nAluko, whose brother Sone plays for Fulham, was last season's top scorer in the Women's Super League and featured in the Professional Footballers' Association women's Team of the Year.\n\nHowever, the 30-year-old was not part of the England squad that reached the semi-finals of the European Championship, instead working as part of Channel 4's commentary team. Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, has already said the FA needs to explain the full details around the case, pointing out it has a \"responsibility to be transparent\".\n\nThe FA held an internal investigation and also commissioned a confidential independent inquiry, which did not uphold Aluko's complaint and found no case for disciplinary action, before deciding not to take action against Sampson or any member of staff. Yet Aluko's evidence states her team-mate was left \"distressed\" by the comment and that other players confirmed they did not take it as a joke. The Guardian knows the identity of the player concerned but has chosen not to name her.\n\nAluko, who is also a qualified lawyer, says in her complaint there were \"derogatory, racial and prejudicial connotations\" and the FA will now have to explain why it went to such apparently extraordinary lengths to prevent the case becoming public.\n\nAs well as the \u00a380,000 payment, the governing body also awarded Aluko a new one-year central contract, worth \u00a320,000, despite her making it clear she would never appear for England again \"under his [Sampson's] management\".\n\nAluko has not played for England since April and her eight-page complaint, emailed to the FA's technical director, Dan Ashworth, and head of performance, Dave Reddin, as part of an exercise to gather information about the culture within England's squads, alleges a \"culture of bullying and harassment\" in the women's setup.\n\nAluko's evidence continues: \"This comment about the player was made with derogatory, racial and prejudicial connotations. It was also a defamatory, untrue statement given that the player has never been arrested and MS's comment indicates an assumption (subconscious or conscious) that being mixed race from London suggests a criminal record with the police.\n\n\"Although I was not present at the meeting, other players confirmed MS made this comment. Other players confirmed the comment was not received as a joke and created an awkward atmosphere in the room. I was deeply concerned about this comment and felt it was highly inappropriate for the national team coach to make such a sweeping negative generalisation about a new player in the team.\"\n\nPublicly, Aluko has stated only that she believes team selections were made on the basis of \"popularity\" rather than form. However, privately the player who has won 102 caps for her country appears to have felt like she was the victim of sustained bullying and alleges the unfavourable treatment began a month after Sampson's appointment in April 2014.\n\nDrawing a link to the alleged incident, Aluko's complaint continued: \"As a black female in the team, understanding the unfavourable, racial and social connotations underlying MS's comment further heightened my feelings of fear and isolation, especially in light of the previous instances where I have been negatively singled out, too.\"\n\nIt is understood that footage of the meeting exists, which was relied upon by Katherine Newton, the barrister who conducted the FA's inquiry, but that it was not supplied to Aluko's team and it is not clear whether it shows the entire exchange. It is also understood that Aluko was not interviewed as part of the process, with one source also claiming that the player in question was not spoken to either.\n\nThe FA refused to comment on the details of the allegations but said that it made the agreement with Aluko to avoid disruption for Sampson and the women's team in the buildup to the European Championship. The FA, it can also be confirmed, paid for the independent investigation that was overseen by Newton from December to March. Newton eventually delivered a report stating there was no case to answer.\n\n\"The FA can confirm an independent investigation found no wrong-doing in respect of a grievance raised by Eniola Aluko in 2016,\" the governing body said in a statement.\n\n\"Following an internal review into allegations raised by Eniola Aluko last year, the FA commissioned an independent investigation conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton, from Old Square Chambers. Ms Newton is an expert on employment and discrimination law,\" it said.\n\n\"The detailed independent investigation report did not uphold any of Eniola Aluko's complaints and found no wrong-doing on behalf of the FA or others. The report recommended that a more detailed response to Eniola Aluko's original complaints should be made and so the FA commissioned Ms Newton to write to Eniola Aluko to provide such a response, in order to ensure complete transparency and objectivity of the findings.\n\n\"Eniola Aluko remains a centrally contracted player. A complaint was made in 2016 and Eniola Aluko is not precluded from speaking about the facts of that complaint.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the independent investigation's findings, the FA agreed a mutual resolution so as to avoid disruption to the squad's tournament preparations. It was not to prevent disclosure.\"\n\nAluko says she has declined to comment because of the terms of her confidentiality agreement and the Guardian understands she is said to be surprised by the suggestion from the FA that she is now free to talk. Her case alleged another incident, in the video analysis of one match, when one coach praised her fitness results and another replied: \"Yeah, but she is lazy as fuck.\"\n\nIn another instance, one coach could be heard saying: \"Fuck off Eni\" after she lost possession. The analysis was said to have been available to all players. Aluko claimed staff would try to \"undermine and belittle\" herself and others.\n\nAsked whether it or Sampson wanted to comment on the specific allegations, the FA referred to its statement.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100, "id": 282, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302536", "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303358", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulham_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306193", "label": {"eng": "Fulham F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Footballers'_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307314", "label": {"eng": "Professional Footballers' Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312214", "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312962", "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313161", "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315368", "label": {"eng": "Eni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sone_Aluko", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "400184", "label": {"eng": "Sone Aluko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eniola_Aluko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "544721", "label": {"eng": "Eniola Aluko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_WSL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "570724", "label": {"eng": "FA WSL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sampson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574787", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sampson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_It_Out_(organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "612800", "label": {"eng": "Kick It Out (organisation)"}}]}

Four times isn't it?\"\n\nThe player in question is not understood to have been interviewed as part of the inquiry or by an internal FA review that also cleared Sampson.\n\nAluko had described her team-mate as \"distressed\" and other sources have told the Guardian the same. At least one other player who was with England during the China Cup in 2015 said she believed the comment was made.\n\nHowever, the official report notes that the video evidence, recorded by an FATV cameraman, does not show the manager making any comment of that nature.\n\n\"The player in question is in the video, as are three other white players and Mark Sampson,\" a 15-page summary of Newton's final report states. \"The sound is clear and there are no references to police cautions or anyone being arrested, let alone a suggestion directly to the player in question that she has been arrested.\n\n\"Mark Sampson has no recollection of making the complaint and says he cannot imagine suggesting to a player they have been arrested. You (Aluko) were not present at the meeting and so cannot provide any direct evidence as to what was or what was not said. I do not dispute your account that the player in question was upset about something she thought had been said and conveyed this to you. However, having watched the video and heard the evidence, I do not consider there to be sufficient evidence to uphold this complaint.\"\n\nThe FA followed up the inquiry by paying Aluko about \u00a380,000 as part of an agreement and awarding her a central contract, worth another \u00a320,000, even though she had made it clear she would not play for England again while Sampson was in charge.\n\nThe explanation for the agreement was that the FA wanted to \"avoid disruption\" before this summer's Euro 2017 tournament. Aluko's lawyers believe that the agreement prevents her from speaking about the case but the FA insists she is now free to talk.\n\nAluko's case against Sampson made a number of other allegations about his behaviour in the England set-up, citing eight specific incidents, but Newton did not find the manager guilty of any wrongdoing.\n\n\"I do not consider that Mark Sampson has held a long-standing negative bias against you (Aluko) based on negative racial stereotypes,\" the barrister concludes. \"Nor do I consider he subjected you to a course of bullying or belittling behaviour. I should add that I consider you genuinely have been treated in this manner. However, I do not consider there is sufficient evidence to support that belief or to draw an inference of discrimination.\"\n\nThe FA's decision to publish the findings came after the Guardian's revelations on Wednesday about the content of Aluko's complaint and has led to an admission from Sampson that there are areas of his behaviour, specifically his communication, that need improvement.\n\n\"I fully understood and welcomed the need for an internal review and an independent investigation by an expert on employment and discrimination law,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"It's incredibly important that matters like this are taken extremely seriously and investigated in the right way - with the right level of sensitivity and support for all involved.\n\n\"The barrister's final report said there was no case to answer and noted that my approach to all players is the same regardless of their background. I also appreciated that the report highlighted areas where I could improve my general communication style, and that is something I have taken on board and looked to improve.\"\n\nAluko, last season's top scorer in the Women's Super League, made the complaint in the form of an eight-page email in May 2016 and Newton took evidence from \"10 individuals\" before a 57-page report was delivered to the FA.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, anti-discrimination groups called for more transparency around the case and the circumstances in which the payment to Aluko was made.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players", "wgt": 100, "id": 448, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Players"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "wgt": 100, "id": 567, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "wgt": 100, "id": 957, "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302536", "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303668", "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304436", "label": {"eng": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "312214", "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313161", "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315368", "label": {"eng": "Eni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_caution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "398184", "label": {"eng": "Police caution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sampson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "574787", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sampson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "574789", "label": {"eng": "England women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

Newton's verdict also exonerated Sampson, although it is understood both Aluko and the player in question were not interviewed.\n\nAluko's case claimed her team-mate had felt unable to speak out because she was scared of losing her place, and the eight-page complaint alleged there were \"derogatory, racial and prejudicial connotations\" attached to a question of that nature being asked to a mixed-race player from London.\n\nWhile Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, has asked the FA if he can see its full finding, one of the sport's other campaign groups, Show Racism the Red Card, is hoping the governing body can learn from what has happened. \"It could certainly be used as an example in training [of equality issues],\" Ged Grebby, the organisation's founder and chief executive, said. \"From the comments I have read, I can understand why Eni Aluko has said it was inappropriate.\"\n\nOf the FA in general, he added: \"If you have equality in your statute books, you need to put it into practice and the FA still tends to be stale, pale, white old men. I know they have done some things to improve that, and brought in some good people, but this is another example where training is important and transparency would have helped.\"\n\nOuseley has been following the story since it emerged Aluko had been paid \u00a380,000 - the official explanation from the FA being that it wanted to \"avoid disruption\" before the European Championship last month - and he has asked the authority if it would supply him with the full details.\n\n\"I've said to the FA, and made it clear to them, that if I was asked publicly by someone: 'Have you got confidence in the FA's procedures in incidents of discrimination?' I would say I have every confidence in the matters we deal with concerning on-field issues.\n\n\"What I couldn't tell you is whether I should have confidence in the FA's internal processes such as the one we are dealing with in Eni's case, as an employee and an employer, because I have never had access to it. That's what I'm asking: 'If you, the FA, would like me to have confidence in your processes I need to see this and examine it for myself forensically.'\n\n\"If they're not prepared to say anything, are they prepared to share the information? So far, I'm still waiting for a response.\"\n\nSampson has chosen not to comment, according to his employer, who has referred only to the statement clarifying the manager was cleared of wrongdoing and stating - in direct opposition to Aluko's account - that the agreement does not prevent her discussing her complaint.\n\nThe Guardian knows the identity of the second player but has decided not to identify her. Other sources have confirmed the player told them the same story about Sampson's alleged remark and that she was clearly upset and demoralised.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 100, "id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Business/Management"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302552", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302606", "label": {"eng": "Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302909", "label": {"eng": "Complaint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303325", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303358", "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303415", "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303668", "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304357", "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305842", "label": {"eng": "Chairman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307302", "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307923", "label": {"eng": "Multiracial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308452", "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312214", "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313161", "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "313910", "label": {"eng": "Isaac Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314936", "label": {"eng": "Sport governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eni", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315368", "label": {"eng": "Eni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317044", "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sone_Aluko", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "400184", "label": {"eng": "Sone Aluko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sampson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "574787", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sampson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "574789", "label": {"eng": "England women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_It_Out_(organisation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "612800", "label": {"eng": "Kick It Out (organisation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Ouseley,_Baron_Ouseley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "612802", "label": {"eng": "Herman Ouseley, Baron Ouseley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_Racism_the_Red_Card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "709389", "label": {"eng": "Show Racism the Red Card"}}]}

Aluko, 30, the top goalcorer in last season's Women's Super League was not part of the squad for this summer's Euros.\n\nThe alleged incident concerned Sampson addressing a mixed race player and implying she had been arrested by the police on more than once occasion. The Football Association commissioned an independent inquiry into Sampson's behaviour led by the barrister Katherine Newton who found no wrongdoing on the part of the England coach.\n\nIn a statement released by the FA, on Thursday night, Sampson said: \"I fully understood and welcomed the need for an internal review and an independent investigation by an expert on employment and discrimination law.\n\n\"It's incredibly important that matters like this are taken extremely seriously and investigated in the right way - with the right level of sensitivity and support for all involved.

My focus is fully on continuing to support the team and the start of our World Cup campaign in September.\"", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "wgt": 100, "id": 30, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People", "wgt": 100, "id": 115, "label": "dmoz/Society/People"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Women", "wgt": 100, "id": 121, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Women"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100, "id": 256, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100, "id": 597, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 100, "id": 673, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307923", "label": {"eng": "Multiracial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312214", "label": {"eng": "Barrister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313161", "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sone_Aluko", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "400184", "label": {"eng": "Sone Aluko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eniola_Aluko", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "544721", "label": {"eng": "Eniola Aluko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_WSL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "570724", "label": {"eng": "FA WSL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sampson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "574787", "label": {"eng": "Mark Sampson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_women's_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "574789", "label": {"eng": "England women's national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

The FA, effectively her employers, insist she is at liberty to do so despite making the payment to \"avoid disruption\" in the run up to Euro 2017. But the player's lawyers insist that it prevents her from doing so.\n\nAluko's indomitable spirit was evident from an early age, as was her footballing talent. Having been born in Lagos in Nigeria, she moved to Birmingham with her family at just a year old. It was at her home in the south of the city, Kings Norton, that she began to play.\n\nIllustrating a deadly accuracy in front of goal that would see her rise swiftly though the England ranks, she bagged an impressive 50 goals in 16 games for her Broadmeadow Junior School team, aged 11.\n\nIt was inevitable that scouts would be interested. Snapped up by Birmingham City from Leafield Athletic Ladies, she scored on her debut, aged 14, against Leeds United - earning her first England call up.\n\nDespite her ties to Nigeria (for whom her brother, the Fulham winger Sone Aluko, plays), she chose to progress with England.\n\n\"The main thing for me is for people to understand that choosing to play for England doesn't mean that I don't support Nigeria. I'm as much Nigerian as I'm British,\" she later told the BBC. \"Of course Nigeria means a lot to me, it's part of me, but I've been brought up by English coaches.\"\n\nIn her three years at Birmingham, where she played alongside fellow England international Karen Carney, the now 15-year-old was a part of the young team that lost 7-1 to Fulham in the FA Women's Premier League Cup Final. The final, now played at Wembley in front of 35,000, was then staged at the home of Wycombe Wanderers.\n\nBut she then helped the side to win promotion to the Premier League National Division (then the top flight) and finish runners-up in the Premier League Cup. Her electric form in front of goal led manager Marcus Bignot to describe her as \"the Wayne Rooney of women's football.\" The FA agreed, naming her young player of the year in 2003.\n\nA career as a footballer doesn't set you up for life in the way it does the men, particularly in the days before the professional Women's Super League - launched by the FA five years ago.\n\nDespite the evident potential for a longlasting playing career, Aluko always saw football as passion, something to do alongside building a strong academic foundation for a future beyond the game.\n\nHer fight on the pitch is reflected in her fight off it. She moved to Charlton from the Midlands and juggled club football, her first senior England cap at 17 and Euro 2005, with her A-Levels, working to fulfil a life-long ambition of studying law. With England the hosts of Euro 2005, she sat a history exam on the morning of England's second group game -- a 2-1 defeat to Denmark.\n\nFollowing more success at Charlton -- twice league runners-up, FA Cup winners in 2005, Premier League Cup winners in 2006 -- Aluko found herself in a situation many top players are all too familiar with.\n\nWith the men's side relegated from the Premier League, 2007 saw the controversial disbanding of the women's team and almost all of the senior side departed before a rescue deal saved the women's set up.\n\nAluko then embarked on what would be her first spell at Chelsea, joining alongside England goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain and fellow Charlton castaway Casey Stoney.\n\nAfter the 2007 Women's World Cup, which England excited at the quarter final stage losing 3-0 to the US, she shone in England's march to the final of Euro 2009. She scored in the group stage against Russia, bagged a brace in the quarter-final against Finland and provided the assist for Kelly Smith's semi-final opener against the Netherlands.\n\nFollowing their defeat to Germany in the final, the striker took the route followed by a number of senior England internationals at the time and headed stateside to join St Louis Athletica in the Women's Professional Soccer league (WPS) and was the club's leading goalscorer and assist provider.\n\nAgain thrust into the unknown when Athletica folded midway through their 2010 season, she joined Atlanta Beat before being traded to Sky Blue FC in December. In her two year odyssey across America, she scored 19 goals in 54 appearances - a run which was only brought to a halt by the collapse of the WPS in 2012.\n\nAluko returned to England and rejoined Birmingham for one season, lifting the FA Cup in the process by beating Chelsea on penalties to win the side's first major trophy in 44 years.\n\nShe then returned to west London where she has 26 goals in 60 appearances for the Blues, won the Women's Super League in 2015, was WSL topscorer in 2016 and has been nominated for numerous individual awards as part of an exciting, attacking Chelsea side led by Emma Hayes.\n\nIt is one of many ironies about the current situation that she has found herself at odds with the FA and Sampson - she won her last cap in May 2016 and was left out of the Euro 2017 squad in April this year - at just the time the governing body is backing women's football with unprecedented investment.\n\nIt has vowed to double the number of girls playing the game by the end of the decade and invested \u00a317.7m in the sport last year.\n\nAluko's football career didn't put her academic aspirations on the back burner. In 2008 she graduated from Brunel University with a First Class Law degree and went on to qualify as a lawyer at the end of 2014.\n\nThe last time I saw Aluko, she was speaking to an array of academically disenfranchised primary and secondary school pupils brought together by the charity Football Beyond Borders trying to be the role model that she feels she didn't have growing up.\n\n\"When I was growing up I didn't have female role models in football. It was the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena that I looked up to, but they didn't play my sport. Hopefully now, that's what I am to a young girl that plays football,\" she said.\n\nShe has never been afraid to give an opinion. From diversity and the Rooney Rule, to Jessica Ennis-Hill's stance on the return of Ched Evans to Sheffield United, the player is always ready speak up on issues she feels are important.\n\nPerhaps it's that honesty that led to her being chosen as the first female pundit on Match of the Day. Aluko was also part of the ITV team at Euro 2016 in France last summer and was recruited by Channel 4 to cover Euro 2017 in the Netherlands, where England ultimately lost in the semi-finals to the hosts.\n\nShe was similarly vocal in her displeasure at being left out of the England fold, publicly accusing Sampson of choosing his favourites above those in form, while privately submitting the complaint we've now become privy to.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 31, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football"}, {"uri":

It makes for uncomfortable reading\n\nWhat a mess the Football Association has made. When the top scorer in the Women's Super League was not picked for England's Euro 2017 squad this summer, it looked like a familiar tale: a brilliant player and the manager, Mark Sampson, clash over differing styles. The result is sore egos and not much else. However, when allegations of racism and harassment surfaced, the disagreement appeared much more disturbing. What is bizarre is that this did not start off as a complaint but fell out of an official investigation into football's sporting culture. The striker, Eni Aluko, who is also a qualified lawyer, had been asked to give her views and when she did so about management, her prospects dimmed. This looks terrible. The FA did investigate Ms Aluko's claims and, after an independent inquiry, Mr Sampson was cleared and Ms Aluko paid \u00a380,000, effectively silenced and sidelined. The FA chose not to comment on the story, relenting only after a day of media scrutiny. When it finally published the report into the affair, it revealed a fair amount of \"industrial language\" and frankly inappropriate comments. Being called \"lazy as fuck\" or a \"pain in the arse\" isn't motivational.

Nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nWhat would it do to prevent the ghastly late free-for-all of deadline day? Nothing. To force down transfer fees and agents' cuts? Nothing. In fact it is hard to see what a unilateral change in the window would achieve, except pretend to solve a problem that is entirely of the clubs' making anyway.\n\nOn September 7, the 20 clubs that are the Premier League's shareholders will discuss a proposal to close the transfer window in England before the season starts.\n\nPlayers like Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho will always attract the attention of Barcelona\n\nSouthampton defender Virgil van Dijk is angling for a move away from St Mary's this summer\n\nThis comes on the back of a summer plagued by uncertainty. Many clubs still do not know how their squad will shape up, some key players are suffering mysterious afflictions or have had their heads turned by transfer speculation.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson was missing from Swansea's first game of the season, and has subsequently been sold to Everton, but doubt still surrounds Coutinho, Virgil van Dijk, Danny Drinkwater, Alexis Sanchez, Ross Barkley, Danny Rose, Jonny Evans, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Riyad Mahrez, and others.\n\nBut notice anything? Coutinho aside, with all of those unsettled players, it is an English club doing the unsettling. In turn: Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester City, Tottenham, Chelsea, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal. So this is completely within the grasp of English football. It doesn't require legislation; it requires a little self-control.\n\nIf most club owners seem to think this is a good idea it is because, left alone, they cannot be trusted. They backed a form of financial fair play for the same reason -- oh please, Mr Scudamore, save us from ourselves! -- and with about as much thought.\n\nClosing the transfer window early is the dumbest thing English football could do. It is so dumb that David Davis could have proposed it as part of his negotiations with the European Union. Yes, that dumb.\n\nArsenal forward Alexis Sanchez will continue to be linked with a move away from the Emirates\n\nTake Coutinho. There is nothing closing the English transfer window prematurely could do that would stop Barcelona niggling away, having lost Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. Nothing that would deter the player from submitting a transfer request, nothing that would stop his representative revealing any clauses or assurances he may feel would facilitate the move.\n\nAll it would mean is that if Liverpool's owners grew tired of the distraction of Barcelona's interest, they could not line up a replacement for Coutinho, then get the deals done. They could only lose. The potential for leaving English clubs weaker is enormous.\n\nYes, runs the counter argument. But if English football announced that its summer window would close one week before the first game of the season -- so next year, probably around midnight on Saturday, August 11 -- then all clubs, agents and players would know that business would have to be done by that date.\n\nTo which: yeah, right. Do you really think that Barcelona, Coutinho or his agent would give the smallest consideration to some arbitrary date decided by a vote of clubs in one country?\n\nWatford manager Marco Silva feels the current transfer deadline creates a lot of uncertainty\n\nLiverpool have stated several times that the player is not for sale at any price. Have Barcelona gone away? No. So why would a rule that only applies in England make them think differently?\n\nBut after that August cut-off, surely foreign clubs would know that English counterparts would be reluctant to sell? They know that anyway. The season here has started.\n\nFor Liverpool to sell now would be disastrous and Barcelona are aware. They just don't care. Equally, West Ham -- among the supporters of a unilateral window here -- are unconcerned that buying William Carvalho after the Portuguese league has begun might hurt Sporting Lisbon.\n\nJurgen Klopp, in particular, is exasperated that the Coutinho problem will not go away. He thought that the club statement, issued a week ago, was the end of the matter. 'The club's definitive stance is that no offers for Philippe will be considered and he will remain a member of Liverpool Football Club when the summer window closes,' it read.\n\nCoutinho has been earmarked as one of the replacements for the departed Neymar (pictured)\n\nKlopp was then infuriated to be asked questions about Coutinho's transfer request. 'Why do they keep asking?' he wanted to know. A club official explained that the press had to find if Coutinho's request had changed anything.\n\nThat was too much for Klopp. 'Why? Why would it change anything? We said it was a definitive stance! What is the point of having a definitive stance if it is not f****** definitive?'\n\nAnd he has a point. Liverpool are adamant Coutinho will not be sold. Yet Barcelona do not lose too many of these wrangles.\n\nIn future, English football may indignantly signal its artificial deadline day but on the continent that stance will be met with a shrug and another telephone call.\n\nWest Ham were definitively not selling Dimitri Payet to Marseille last January, if you recall.\n\nLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has continually been asked questions about Coutinho's future\n\nYet sagas involving European royalty are comparatively rare. Most of the disruption around the start of this season is caused by English clubs preying on domestic rivals, which is why any new legislation also represents ethical failure.\n\nExactly the same could be achieved by a gentlemen's agreement to say there will be no transfers between Premier League clubs from a week before the season starts. If, on midnight August 4 this year, an unofficial deadline was agreed to have occurred then the majority of domestic transfer business would be dead.\n\nIt would not stop Liverpool entering the market were they to lose Coutinho, but it might have focused the mind of, say, Sigurdsson -- or at least made Everton act a little more promptly.\n\nFor that is another issue formal window adjustment will not correct. Deadline day chaos would not be avoided with the close brought forward, it would just be shifted to a different date. Instead of a flurry of business on August 31, the mayhem would occur earlier.\n\nWest Ham opted not to stand in Dimitri Payet's way last January after he caused disharmony\n\nIndeed, with a shorter window and the threat of sales -- but no buys -- the likely result is that prices would be hiked and agent fees increased to get the deal done. With little more than a month between the start of pre-season training and the suspension of transfer activity, the rush would be huge, the premiums enormous.\n\nClubs and managers would also get no opportunity to properly road test their plans, to see what works. At least now a manager has a clearer idea of the areas that need strengthening.\n\nIn recent days, there have been suggestions a resistance to the proposal is growing. Manchester United are said to be against it, Watford too.\n\nA winning vote needs 14 clubs. Are there 14 seriously willing to indulge this ridiculous restraint of trade? Maybe they should study how Liverpool's reluctance is playing in Spain, and think about the future.\n\nShould Coutinho depart, Liverpool have the chance to reinvest the money on strengthening\n\nREAL SCANDAL OF ALUKO'S CASE IS THE WASTED CASH\n\nCan you imagine the alarm at the FA the day the complaint from Eni Aluko dropped? Here was a black woman alleging bullying and racism by her manager, a white man and an FA employee.\n\nIn an organisation that positively aches to be seen to do the right thing, this was British Cycling and Luis Aragones rolled into one: a PR PC disaster.\n\nThe FA held an internal investigation and also commissioned an independent inquiry, conducted by a barrister, Katharine Newton of Old Square Chambers. Newton is black, female and a respected expert in employment law.\n\nShe supported the FA's investigators in finding no cause for disciplinary action against Mark Sampson, England Women's manager.\n\nYet such was the FA's desire to avoid a scandal, they compensated Aluko anyway: \u00a380,000 to 'avoid disruption' before this summer's European Championship, and a \u00a320,000 one-year contract with the national team despite Aluko stating she could not play for Sampson again.\n\nThe FA denies it was hush money, although it is hard to justify it any other way.\n\nYet Newton was right. The case against Sampson appears extraordinarily flimsy. The bullying amounted to a coach describing Aluko as 'lazy as f***' during a video analysis, and another coach exclaiming 'f*** off, Eni' when she lost possession.\n\nEni Aluko made a bullying and harassment complaint to the Football Association\n\nIf every coach who spoke that way about his players was dismissed for bullying, dug-outs would empty overnight. This is the blunt, industrial language that is part of all sports.\n\nSir Bobby Charlton recalls being halfway through calling George Best a greedy bastard for hogging the ball when the Northern Irishman scored one of the best goals he had ever seen. It happens. Between team-mates, between colleagues, even between friends.\n\nAnd it's an opinion. England's coaching staff are perfectly entitled to have a view of Aluko and if this is that she's 'lazy as f***', then it's their call.\n\nShe might wish to do more to change their minds, rather than claim to be bullied.\n\nThe accusation of racism is harder to judge, not being in the room. But then neither was Aluko, so here goes.\n\nAluko says that during a meeting with the midfielders, in which she was not present, Sampson made a point about pressing hard, using an analogy about getting cautioned by the police. Turning to a player, who was mixed race, he said: 'Haven't you been arrested before? Four times isn't it?'\n\nAluko claims the remark was 'highly inappropriate' and there were 'derogatory racial and prejudicial connotations' due to the player being mixed race.\n\nAluko claimed England Women's manager Mark Sampson (pictured) asked another national team player 'how many times she had been arrested'\n\nShe said the comment was not received as a joke and created an awkward atmosphere. Certainly it sounds clumsy, no matter the ethnicity of the player.\n\nYet England's problem at the European Championship was technique, not team spirit. The players seemed very loyal to Sampson, and it is interesting that none have come out in public support of Aluko since her grievances went public -- unlike the backing for cyclist Jess Varnish, when she made her complaint against Shane Sutton.\n\nAs Aluko was not in the meeting, her reading of the mood and the way the comment was delivered and received are all second hand. It could have been a poor joke, or a ham-fisted attempt to lighten the mood.\n\nOne imagines if Sampson routinely accused his players of being criminals, he would not find them as faithful. It also transpires the FA received Aluko's eight-page letter of complaint as part of an exercise to gather information about the culture within England's squads.\n\nIt was sent to technical director Dan Ashworth and head of performance Dave Reddin. Too busy by half, that pair. Managing England is tough enough, without your bosses conducting a vox pop on your mentoring skills.\n\nSo the FA got an answer they were not expecting, and panicked. Ultimately, there is little evidence here of bullying or racism, but there is a case for misuse of funds.\n\nBarristers do not come cheap, and Newton's verdict should have been the end of it. Whoever then authorised \u00a3100,000 to keep Aluko quiet shouldn't be let near a budget again.\n\nAluko has bagged 33 goals for England in 102 caps but has not played since last April\n\nSHARAPOVA'S WILDCARD SHAM\n\nAs part of the agreement affording wildcard entry to the US Open, Maria Sharapova has agreed to speak to young American players about the tennis anti-doping programme.\n\nOne question: if none of them have failed a test, or served a ban, why would they need to hear from her? Particularly if all she has to offer is the same mealy-mouthed protestations and excuses explaining her suspension from the game?\n\nMaria Sharapova has been handed an automatic wildcard entry into the US Open\n\nOne of the questions I am increasingly asked of late is whether I am going to Mayweather-McGregor. The answer is no; I'm really not that interested.\n\nAt this time of year, however, I do often regret that the demands of the new football season prevent me attending the Solheim Cup. Now there's a proper fight.\n\nConor McGregor takes on Floyd Mayweather in Las Vegas but the contest is not for everyone\n\nIf Southampton have drawn a line in the sand on transfers, good. An outstanding team could be assembled from the players they have sold since 2006.\n\nBy digging in over Virgil van Dijk they hope to change their reputation as a club whose players can be bought. It will take more than one window to believe, but it can be done.\n\nA word of warning, though. It only needs one sale to change that narrative.\n\nTottenham had altered the perception of being a club that sells its best, but Kyle Walker's move to Manchester City changed that. Since then, they have had the Danny Rose rumpus and further speculation around Dele Alli.\n\nSell one player, and it is presumed you'll sell them all.\n\nTottenham selling just one player - Kyle Walker - has altered the perception of the club\n\nDoes the photograph of David Beckham and his newly-assembled Lego Disney Castle suggest a bloke with too much time on his hands?\n\nYes, it's for his daughter, Harper, who is six -- but isn't the point that she at least helps build it? Someone give this man a job.\n\nThe former footballer David Beckham took six days to complete the 4,000 piece creation", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type":

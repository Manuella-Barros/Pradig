Ukrainian authorities say Russia fired more than 50 missiles and 20 drones, targeting energy infrastructure around the country. Ukraine's largest power company said this was the fifth time Russia has attacked its facilities in the last six weeks.\n\n\"They are trying to cause as many suffering to Ukrainian people as possible now in order to take advantage of and destroy Ukrainian moral,\" Ukrainian parliament member Oleksiy Goncharenko told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nThe months-long delay in approval of the funding was resolved last month when Republican Speaker Mike Johnson defied opposition from the right of his party to bring a major security package that paired Ukraine funding with aid for Israel and Taiwan up for a vote.\n\nBut months of inaction has resulted in real costs for Ukrainian forces on the battlefield in both territory and casualties, these officials say. Russian forces are expected to attempt to make further progress and consolidate earlier gains, before this window of opportunity closes.\n\nWestern and Ukrainian officials view the near-term threat of stepped-up attacks as tied to Russian plans for a larger offensive early this summer. US and Ukrainian officials remain concerned about a further partial mobilization by Russia to send more manpower to the frontlines, as Ukraine is struggling with its own manpower shortage.\n\nAs for Ukrainian prospects during the coming weeks, even with the arrival of new assistance, one US military official told CNN, \"It is hold the line at best.\"\n\n\"With the level of supply, it will be very hard for us to regain in any territory,\" Goncharenko agreed. \"So it's more about stabilizing. It's more about winning the time, but not winning the war. So we need more support and we hope, or other countries will follow the US example.\"\n\nCNN reported recently that Russian forces have used an \"artillery drought\" plaguing Ukrainian forces to push forward on the eastern front near Avdiivka, carrying out the largest Russian advance since the early months of the war. Moscow's progress has prompted warnings from senior Ukrainian military officials of a possible threat to Kyiv's supply lines and hubs in the east, which are now perilously close to being in range of superior Russian firepower.\n\nIn recent weeks, Russia has thrown vast resources at weak Ukrainian defenses across the eastern frontlines, pushing toward three key points: the vital military hub of Pokrovsk, west of Avdiivka; the strategic heights of Chasiv Yar, near Bakhmut; and Kurakhove in the southeast.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The village sits at the western point of a salient the Russians have gradually built west of Avdiivka after taking that city in February.\n\nThey took advantage of a poorly executed substitution of Ukraine's defending battalion to enter Ocheretyne in late April, but faced fierce resistance.\n\nRussia's defence ministry announced Ocheretyne had fallen on May 5, Orthodox Easter Sunday.\n\nSatellite imagery appeared to confirm that, and three days later Russian forces consolidated their catch by advancing four kilometres (2.5 miles) north of the village and extending their gains to its south.\n\nNational Guard captain Volodymyr Cherniak told The Guardian the Russian forces did this by flanking defences the Ukrainians had taken too long to dig because they lacked construction crews.\n\nRussian forces made marginal gains as they fought street-to-street in Robotyne, a small town in western Zaporizhia that Ukrainian forces recaptured in last year's counteroffensive. And on Monday, they swallowed Novoselivske, a village in Luhansk.\n\nSergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, claimed during a conference call with Moscow's military leadership that their forces had seized 547sq kms (211sq miles) of territory in Ukraine since the beginning of the year.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, put the figure at 519sq km (200sq miles).\n\nBut Russian tactical failures were notable.\n\nThroughout the week, they tried and failed to recapture Nestryga, an island in the Dnipro Delta from which they had harassed Ukrainian forces on the right bank, and which Ukraine managed to take back on April 28.\n\nSouthern forces spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk told a telethon there were several assaults a day.\n\n\"The occupiers have a big obstacle - it is the Dnipro, and in order to overcome it, they are forced to use watercraft ... but at the moment they are in an open area and therefore, it is quite difficult for them and they are suffering losses,\" Pletenchuk said.\n\nA Ukrainian bridgehead on the left bank that has forced back Russian artillery even managed to expand its position around Krynky by Monday. Here, too, relentless Russian assaults since the beginning of the year have failed to dislodge the garrison.\n\nRussian forces also failed to capture the strategically important town of Chasiv Yar in the east - a prize Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly wanted by May 9, the anniversary of Nazi Germany's capitulation 79 years ago.\n\nMore ominously, Ukrainian deputy military intelligence chief Vadym Skibitsky said Russia was possibly preparing to make a renewed attempt to capture Sumy and Kharkiv, two northern cities it failed to take in February 2022 along with Kyiv.\n\nHe told The Economist that Russia had concentrated 35,000 troops north of the Ukrainian border in these areas, and would launch them into Ukraine by late May or early June. Ukrainian military observer Kostyantyn Mashovets estimated the number was closer to 50,000.\n\nUkrainian parliamentarians have told Al Jazeera that Ukraine maintains tens of thousands of troops in the north of the country, far from the active battlefronts, precisely for such an eventuality. During the war, Russian troops based in Belarus have made various feints at a buildup, possibly as a distraction. It now appears Ukraine is taking the threat seriously.\n\nCommander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyii recently said he was sending more artillery and tanks sorely needed on active fronts to bolster northern forces.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly said that they need more Western-supplied weapons to hold out and ultimately push Russia off Ukrainian soil.\n\nUS President Joe Biden signed into law a supplemental spending bill on April 24, after Congress took six months to approve it, but there has been disagreement on how long a billion dollars' worth of weapons readied for delivery took to reach Ukraine.\n\nPentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said deliveries have reached Ukraine \"sometimes within hours if not a day or two\".\n\nBut on Friday, six days after Biden signed the bill, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, \"We are waiting for the weapons to arrive in Ukraine.\"\n\nSomewhat inscrutably, the New York Times said a first batch of antitank rockets, missiles and 155mm artillery rounds had arrived in Ukraine in the interim, on April 28.\n\nUkraine's European allies have continued to send in weapons during the US hold-up, but they have not been sufficient to maintain even defensive operations because Europe's defence industrial base has shrunk since the Cold War.\n\nUkraine embarked on a strategy of building up its own industrial base last December, and invited Western investors to speed up that process.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, sought to do so on Monday, when he brought together 350 Ukrainian and European industry representatives and government officials to foster partnerships backed by EU money.\n\n\"Ukraine is a country at war, it does not produce under normal conditions,\" said Borrell. \"That is why industry representatives must understand that, firstly, these are new opportunities, secondly, that there is a risk, and thirdly, that there is financing.\"\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called for a common European defence industrial space to remove redundancies and competing weapons systems, and for long-term industry contracts and planning of European defence.\n\n\"If we want to preserve peace in Europe, we must move to a European wartime economy and industry,\" he told the forum virtually. \"Only in this way can we restrain Russia's aggression - by demonstrating that Europe has the means for self-defence.\"\n\nKuleba was not the only one calling for an economic and political gear shift.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist on Friday that Europe was facing a triple threat from Russia.\n\n\"It's this triple existential risk for our Europe: a military and security risk; an economic risk for our prosperity; an existential risk of internal incoherence and disruption to the functioning of our democracies.\"\n\nMacron had struck this chord in a speech to the Sorbonne a week earlier.\n\n\"Our Europe today is mortal,\" Macron had said. \"It can die and that depends solely on our choices.\"\n\nEurope was not armed to defend itself when \"confronted by a power like Russia that has no inhibitions, no limits\", Macron said. \"Europe must become capable of defending its interests, with its allies by our side whenever they are willing, and alone if necessary.\"\n\nMacron also reiterated the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine speaking to the Economist, saying it could happen if Russia had a breakthrough and Ukraine requested it. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the statement was \"very important and very dangerous\".\n\nUkraine's deputy military intelligence chief agreed that Europe was not ready to defend itself.\n\nVadym Skibitsky told Newsweek Russia could overrun the Baltic states in a week, whereas it would take NATO at least 10 days to begin the process of coming to their aid.\n\nFrom NATO's perspective, the need to help Ukraine has been growing along with the Russian threat perception in the rest of Europe.\n\nFour months after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, NATO said it would create a standing force of 300,000 troops to defend its eastern borders, up from about 80,000 today. In January, a series of NATO defence chiefs sharing similar intelligence said the alliance should prepare for a potential Russian invasion of NATO soil in as little as five to eight years' time.\n\nOn May 2, NATO's political decision-making body, the Atlantic Council, said NATO allies are \"deeply concerned about recent malign activities on Allied territory\".\n\nSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said a Russian campaign of hybrid activities including misinformation, espionage and sabotage was already under way in Europe.\n\nThe Financial Times on Sunday quoted European intelligence officials saying Russia was preparing \"covert bombings, arson attacks, and damage to infrastructure\" in Europe.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"},

Are Washington and Brussels ready for it?\n\nThe approval of U.S. aid to Ukraine, long overdue and needlessly controversial, is a major milestone. But a milestone on the way to what? The money, or the hardware it will pay for, is desperately needed to keep the Ukrainian military in the fight, to protect Ukraine's people and infrastructure from Russia's aerial onslaught, and to keep grinding down the Russian military machine. But a lot has happened in the eight months it took Congress to act. The key question that needs an answer now is: what are Ukraine's war aims and strategy to achieve them? As serious doubts about the viability of Kyiv's current strategy are being raised, Ukraine and -- just as important -- its allies on both sides of the Atlantic must address this dilemma.\n\nThe dynamics of the war and the prevailing discourse about it have changed dramatically. Eight months ago, the Ukrainian counteroffensive was still underway. The counteroffensive was the embodiment of a theory of victory that called for piercing Russian defenses, cutting off Crimea from the land bridge Russia had seized earlier in the war, and forcing Moscow to negotiate an end to the war on the terms favorable to Kyiv. Until the word \"stalemate\" was brought into the public discussion by none other than Ukraine's lauded former military commander Valeriy Zaluzhnyy, the use of the term was often treated as a sign of unwarranted pessimism, defeatism, or even the parroting of Russian propaganda.\n\nAfter congressional delays of the assistance package and setbacks on the battlefield, Ukraine faces a far more challenging situation. In recent weeks, a new narrative has gained ground: that the stalemate actually may not hold and Russia may instead achieve a major breakthrough.\n\nDespite its obvious disappointments, the Ukrainian counteroffensive offers several important lessons. First, size matters. Military planners have long believed that successful offensive operations require significant advantages in manpower and materiel on the order of three-to-one or even higher, especially when the defender is prepared and dug in, as was the case in the summer of 2023. It is now abundantly clear that the size of Russia's population, economy, stocks of military hardware, and defense-industrial base far exceeds those of Ukraine, even when it is supported by the United States, Europe, other allies, and partners.\n\nSecond, the Russian military has defied expectations by adopting new tactics and deploying new equipment. Written off as inept during the early stages of the war, when Russian President Vladimir Putin's generals bet on Ukrainians greeting them as liberators from what Russian propaganda charged was an illegitimate Nazi regime in Kyiv, Russian forces have recovered. While the United States and its allies may be dismayed by traditional Russian disregard for battlefield losses, they need to acknowledge that Moscow is now using better tactics and fielding some of its hardware more effectively. Last summer, Russia pulled ahead of Ukraine in crucial areas such as drones and electronic warfare.\n\nThe Russian defense industry is also performing rather impressively, despite a reputation for technological obsolescence. It has far overtaken Western production of critical items such as ammunition for artillery, benefited from well-timed help from friends in Iran and North Korea, and found ways to modernize and repurpose old weapons to new uses. The most recent such weapon is the glide-bomb, a massive old \"dumb\" bomb fitted with a kit to give it enough range and accuracy for Russian air force pilots to stay beyond the reach of Ukrainian air defenses.\n\nChina too has offered Russia a helping hand. It has facilitated alternative supply chains and offered substitutes for Western machinery and other components Russian defense industries need to keep running round the clock.\n\nThird, time and time again, the United States and its allies discovered that sanctions did not \"[choke] off Russia's access to key inputs for its military industrial complex and [undermine] the Kremlin's ability to wage its unprovoked war,\" in the words of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Nor did they \"cripple\" the Russian economy. Thanks to a surge in defense orders, the economy is estimated to have grown by 3.6 percent in 2023 and is projected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2024. Despite U.S. and EU efforts to cut off Russia from Western technologies, Russian companies have found alternative supply routes and continue to import dual-use and even military technologies, including from many members of the U.S.-led coalition.\n\nFaced with this grim reality, Ukraine has switched to a strategy of \"active defense\" -- building fortifications and giving its troops a chance to reconstitute, recover, and retrain, while engaging in a series of high-profile strikes inside Russia and attacks on Russia's Black Sea Fleet. But this \"active defense\" strategy requires massive infusions of Western aid and support. Just as importantly, it requires an intake of new recruits following the adoption of a law that expands the pool of eligible conscripts. Occasional deep strikes at targets inside Russia generate publicity and boost morale, as do Ukrainian attacks against Russian ships in the Black Sea. But these successes have little effect on the situation on the battlefield, where Russian troops, despite heavy losses, are slowly gaining ground.\n\nThe rest of 2024, with new U.S. assistance flowing to Ukraine, is supposed to be the year of rebuilding to prepare for offensive operations in 2025, according to some observers. That plan appears highly optimistic. The task of rebuilding Ukrainian army units, many battered by years of uninterrupted combat and heavy losses, will take time -- especially while waging a campaign against a ruthless enemy. So will recruiting, training, and integrating new conscripts in existing units or forming and training entirely new units. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his Western backers are, for the time being at least, loathe to admit publicly that the Ukrainian military is unlikely to be in a position to launch another large-scale counteroffensive in 2025. Ongoing delays in reinvigorating the Western defense industrial base mean that increased production of key weapons and systems that Ukraine needs to conduct such operations are unlikely to be available in sufficient quantity.\n\nUkraine has no good options, even with the latest aid package. Many military analysts have already come to that conclusion privately but are unwilling to voice that sentiment, reluctant to add to the widespread gloomy narrative and face accusations of defeatism.\n\nThe latest $61 billion U.S. aid package is almost certainly the last package of such magnitude, regardless of who gets elected as the next U.S. president. The EU has approved 50 billion euros in financial assistance until 2027, but Ukraine needs that money to keep its government running. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has proposed establishing a $100 billion fund for Ukraine's defenses, but his proposal has been met with little support from NATO members.\n\nUkraine is waging a war against an enemy that shows no inclination to stop its aggression and negotiate in earnest. Having bet his entire presidency on this war, Putin is in no mood to give up. Ukraine's need for help, even with the adoption of a defensive strategy for the long run, is open-ended. Are Washington and Brussels ready for it?\n\nThat is the key question for NATO's upcoming summit in Washington. Instead of arguing about Ukraine's path to NATO membership, the allies should put in place a series of concrete commitments, including more and better capabilities to defend and push back against the Russian onslaught and long-range precision strike weapons to continue and expand strikes deep inside Russia. Such offensive capabilities will position Ukraine to implement a long-term strategy that combines defense with offense and deterrence and inflicts increasingly costly consequences on the Kremlin. Support for Ukraine is the most important piece of the West's containment strategy toward Russia in the new cold war. The Washington summit will answer whether the West is up to the challenge.", "source": {"uri": "carnegieendowment.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carnegie Endowment for International Peace"},

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war, click here.\n\nLatest Developments At A Glance Fresh Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian and infrastructure targets overnight killed two people and caused serious damage to Ukraine's already battered energy infrastructure, regional officials and the military said on May 9. Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on May 9 to dismiss Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskiy and the deputy prime minister for reconstruction, Oleksandr Kubrakov. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy officially made Valeriy Zaluzhniy Kyiv's ambassador to the United Kingdom, after the general was removed from his position as commander in chief of Ukraine's military earlier this year. Just days after announcing military exercises involving tactical nuclear weapons, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned of the rising risk of a global conflict. Officials in Ukraine said on May 8 that a major overnight attack by Russia targeted critical infrastructure in at least six regions. The Ukrainian parliament has approved a bill that would allow some categories of prisoners to serve in the country's armed forces as it defends itself against a full-scale Russian invasion. Ambassadors representing European Union states have reached a deal \"in principle\" to use the proceeds of Russian assets frozen in the EU to finance military aid for Ukraine, the Belgian government said on May 8. Four people have been arrested in India accused of 'trafficking' citizens to fight for the Russian Army in Ukraine, India's Central Bureau of Investigation said on May 8. Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman declined to comment on May 8 on an assertion by Ukrainian intelligence officials a day earlier that they had 'thwarted' an assassination plot against Ukraine's president involving Russia's Federal Security Service. U.S. Weapons Are Coming To Ukraine. But Russian Forces Have The Momentum.\n\nUkraine's defenses are nearing the breaking point amid a shortage of ammunition, manpower, and fortifications. U.S. weaponry is on its way, but it may not arrive in time to blunt Russia's momentum. Read the story by Mike Eckel and Todd Prince here.\n\nLocator Map: Russian Offensives Near Chasiv Yar And Ocheretyne With ATACMS In Hand, Ukraine Looks To Neutralize Putin's Fortress In Crimea\n\nRussia has spent billions militarizing Ukraine's occupied Crimea region since 2014, and it's been a launching pad for air attacks since 2022 and a staging ground for forces on Ukraine's mainland. Now, Kyiv thinks it can counter the threat from the peninsula with U.S. long-range ATACMS. Read the story by Todd Prince here.\n\nUkraine Welcomes Long-Delayed Military Aid, Vows To Make Up For Lost Time\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden signed a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine on April 24 and said shipments of arms will begin within hours. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the aid, saying the country's military must act fast to make up for months of losses. One military officer said Russia's logistical infrastructure is a likely target for a renewed Ukrainian counteroffensive. By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service\n\nCopyright (c) 2018. RFE/RL, Inc.

But how will the one in Ukraine?", "body": "It is 800 days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine when I sit with Yevhen Hlibovytsky in a small caf\u00e9 near the national public broadcaster in Kyiv. Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles has just wrapped up a flying visit to Ukraine to deliver a further grant of $100 million in military aid. Air raid warnings are frequent again, even as we talk, though with no apparent follow-up of missiles blasting the capital as they did last May when just five days passed without a strike piercing air defences.\n\nThe European spring is breaking, and Kyiv is abundant with flowering chestnut trees. The perfumed thaw, however, is blighted by the recent squandered lives of Ukrainian troops 500 kilometres to the east. This resolute army has waited vainly for the armaments needed to match the Russian winter onslaught. These weapons, now en route after months of crippling delay through US Congressional bickering and European dithering rebuked by French President Emmanuel Macron, might have saved many Ukrainian lives.\n\nHlibovytsky is a political scientist, one of Ukraine's leading entrepreneurial public intellectuals, and a founder in October 2023 of the Frontier Institute. The new Kyiv-based think tank was established to do the urgent thinking for which nobody else in Ukraine has the time or additional energy. \"We're trying to build the cornerstones for policy to make Ukraine ready once the war is over,\" he says. \"Government and civil society are overburdened, and we're the only ones doing this systematically.\"\n\nAll wars end, but like Ukraine's stunning early battlefield success, war rapidly generates change that appals or inspires. Here, innovation breaks musty perceptions and archaic frameworks. Just two years ago, drones were being crowd-funded for Ukraine. Last year, according to Hlibovytsky, Ukraine produced around a million battlefield drones, \"and this year, we can expect perhaps 2-3 million\". Through cyber innovation and steel manufacture, Ukraine is building what might be Europe's most formidable arms industry, never mind her most battle-forged army.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian seizure of the east has smashed Czarist and Soviet-era infrastructure, threatening to return the Donbas \"to what we called in the 17th century the Wild Steppe,\" says Hlibovytsky. The delay in shipments of artillery shells and air defence weapons placed Ukrainian soldiers at least at a 1-to-7 disadvantage against their adversaries through winter, leaving their lines open to incessant pummelling, with single strikes from gliding Russian \"dumb\" bombs wiping out whole units at a blow.\n\nWith an air and artillery dominance directly resulting from sluggish rearmament supplies from allies, Russia has reinvigorated heavy airborne attacks on cities and towns to the east and south. In places such as Kharkiv and Odesa, Ukrainian cities of industry and export, Russian missiles are blasting energy and utility infrastructure, methodically reducing piece-by-piece Ukrainian civilians' capacity to bear the next winter of 2024/25, and weakening existing lines of defence.\n\nThe atrocity ledger cannot be precise, but at 70,000, there are more Ukrainian amputees than Britain suffered in the First World War. Millions of children have broken childhoods - shattered homes, dead friends, the terror of daily air raids, destroyed schools, and bleak memories of Russian forces marauding and pillaging through their villages. They also have fathers and grandfathers now holding the lines in trench warfare who are returning on home leave with unprecedented levels of PTSD, comparable to those who endured the artillery bombardments of the Somme (Hlibovytsky's own 73-year-old father is now a two-year veteran volunteer).\n\nIn an age of backsliding democratic government, the contrast between the piecemeal approach to arms support for Ukraine and the two trillion dollars (or US$300 million per day) spent on supposedly democratising state-building, defence, and social transformation in Afghanistan is stunning. Yet since the fall of the Soviet Union and three ground-swelled democratic revolutions, the trajectory of democracy in Ukraine has only been one of a steady rise over three decades.\n\nUkraine's press freedom has increased despite Russian assault and disinformation warfare. Ukraine is the willing sentinel at Europe's eastern gate against Putin's increasingly aggressive and volatile posture towards EU coherence and governance-by-consent. Ukraine has even despatched troops to the Sahel to counter Russia's military spoliation of US and French peace-building and conflict containment efforts across Africa's desert north.\n\nYet allied policy has been obsessed with the deterrence of Russia's war of aggression. It treats Ukraine as a by-product of that policy instead of the main game, only to see Russia's economy feed from the corpse of Europe's post-Second World War peace dividend. At a Lowy Institute presentation in April, retired Australian Major-General Mick Ryan, recently returned from Ukraine, urged that Ukraine's allies pivot from a policy of \"help Ukraine defend itself against Russia\" to one of defeating Russia decisively in Ukraine.\n\nEqually, allied countries must pivot from consistently frustrated policies that focus on Russian containment and achieving points of leverage (a frustration with Putin's management, which shows no signs of respite). The switch must be one that they can most control - a successful Ukrainian democracy that can fight with both hands, even while beginning to recover. A functionally effective Ukraine-first doctrine would actually serve as the best counter-Russia doctrine.\n\nAside from providing predictability in lines of supply, Ukraine-centric policies must focus on a post-war Ukraine with robust institutions. It already has one of the world's most battle-hardened armies protecting Europe's flank, thriving innovation, and a cutting-edge weapons production that has bloodied the Russian Black Sea fleet, not to mention a thriving, if bruised, democracy.\n\nA pronounced Marshall Plan-like rebuilding program for people and infrastructure would hearten and strengthen our democratic ally. Most starkly, Ukraine's allies must contemplate during this fighting season the very worst: what \"losing\" Ukraine through Russia's current military dominance, a handicapped allied weapons support, and Ukrainian despair and anger at the human cost to their country would mean for arms control and the deterrence of wars of aggression, international laws and norms, global food and energy supply chains, and democratic solidarity.\n\nHlibovytsky's vision for the Frontier Institute is grand but pragmatic, given the current track record of Ukraine's allies: to describe the post-war shape of Ukrainian democracy within the region, and its gravitational pull for other post-Soviet states from within the orbit of the European ecosystem. \"Ukraine can eventually be a donor state, having a kind of USAID for former Soviet states, exerting soft-power status,\" he says. \"This is the crossroads. This is why we call ourselves the Frontier Institute. We've learned to live with a deficit of security, while the developed world is just re-discovering this.\"", "source": {"uri": "lowyinstitute.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lowy Institute for

It's a jarring turnabout. For the last few months, the White House and others issued dire warnings that if left unaided, Ukrainian lines might collapse and Russian troops might again roll on Kyiv. But with the worst averted, sights are setting higher. The Biden administration is now working to build up the Ukrainian Armed Forces over a 10-year period, at a likely cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, while National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan suggested that Ukraine would mount another counteroffensive in 2025.\n\nThis optimism is misplaced. The new bill may well represent the last big package that the United States will send to Ukraine. As the geopolitical analyst Ian Bremmer noted, \"America continuing to send Ukraine [$]60 billion in support year after year [is] unrealistic no matter who wins the presidency.\" Current aid will mostly help to put Ukraine in a better position for future negotiations. It will ameliorate shortfalls in ammunition and weaponry, making it less likely that Ukrainian forces will lose more ground in coming months. Yet Ukraine still faces other challenges: insufficient fortifications, a yawning manpower shortage, and a surprisingly resilient Russian army. On the whole, Ukraine remains the weaker party; Western assistance has not altered that reality.\n\nThe White House presented the supplemental as an all-or-nothing choice: Approve billions in funding or watch Ukraine go under. Such rhetoric contains eerie echoes of wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan, where the United States kept pouring resources into lost causes at least in part because no U.S. leader wanted to be held responsible at the final moment of failure. Throughout the Ukraine aid debate, key questions were left entirely unanswered: What is the United States trying to achieve in Ukraine given that total victory is not feasible? What is it willing to risk and spend to get there? The supplemental punts these uncomfortable questions down the road. But if Washington doesn't confront them, it may end up back in the same position next year -- or worse.\n\nThe matter of an endgame in Ukraine has always been fraught. Political scientists have frequently noted that any end to this war will include diplomatic negotiation. Some draw the conclusion that if negotiation is inevitable, talks should begin sooner rather than later. Others argue that Ukraine must improve its battlefield position before negotiating. The government in Kyiv maintains that Russia must be driven completely out of Ukraine, including Crimea, before talks can begin. Some even argue that regime change in Moscow is a precondition for peace.\n\nThe squishy middle of the Washington debate, which seems to include senior members of the Biden administration, falls somewhere between these extremes: hoping for major Ukrainian advances, while avoiding escalation and acknowledging privately or anonymously that the math is not in Kyiv's favor. The White House is correct that aid should be designed to put the Ukrainians in a strong negotiating position. But this raises further questions: How should one determine when the moment for negotiations has arrived? If Ukraine keeps fighting without talking, will its bargaining power improve or diminish?\n\nThe calculation is also complicated by confusion about what the United States is trying to achieve in Ukraine. Some emphasize broad, universal principles such as defending democracy or protecting the international order. These are laudable goals, but they could plausibly produce opposite conclusions: either that universal principles have already been adequately defended -- the steep price Russia has paid could dissuade future aggressors -- or alternately that Ukraine must score a definitive victory.\n\nMore hard-nosed analysts instead argue that America's primary goal in arming Ukraine is to bleed Russia. Keeping up the flow of Western weapons, they argue, allows the West to diminish Russia's military capabilities at a reasonable cost. As an objective, however, weakening Russia offers no endgame, and implies a long-term, semipermanent commitment to war. Given Russia's ability to reconstitute its forces, it is not even clear the West is succeeding on this front.\n\nA final group offers more concrete goals: enabling Ukraine to retake specific chunks of territory so as to protect its economic viability as a sovereign state, or to prevent Russia from seizing Odesa and other valuable places. But although these are more specific objectives, there is no consensus on them in Western capitals and little willingness to push for peace negotiations once they are achieved.\n\nThis is perhaps why White House officials return so often to the formulation that Western aid is simply intended to put Ukraine in the best possible position at the bargaining table. Saying this requires no difficult decisions about the territory Ukraine needs to retake and no consideration of how long Western aid should continue. It also evades the question of Ukraine's future orientation -- will it join the EU or NATO? -- which may need to be resolved in order to end the war.\n\nIn short, the current approach is a strategic cop-out. Its primary benefit is to paper over differences among Ukraine's supporters. The risk is that the war will join the ranks of forever wars and end in one of three ways: in defeat, on worse terms than could have been obtained earlier, or on the same terms at a higher human and financial toll.\n\n\"Forever war\" became a slogan over the past decade-plus, used by activists to describe the seemingly endless American deployments overseas in complex wars from Afghanistan to Syria and Niger. Like all slogans, the term was imprecise, but it crisply conveyed the problem of waging open-ended conflicts aimed at absolute, unachievable victory.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine should not be directly compared to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: No U.S. troops are engaged in combat, and the government of Ukraine is fighting an illegal invasion. Still, there are parallels. Once the Afghanistan surge failed, the debate pitted those who argued that the conflict could not be won against those who argued that it could be sustained at a low enough cost indefinitely. Today's Ukraine debates have begun to trend in that direction. Sen. Mitch McConnell, among others, has argued that aiding Ukraine is a bargain in defense terms and pumps money back into the U.S. economy.\n\nThe common link between Ukraine and past forever wars is thus the way genuine strategic debate gets evaded or stigmatized. Lawmakers and policymakers find it easier to sustain the war effort by presenting a succession of all-or-nothing choices than to look ahead and weigh realistic alternatives.\n\nProponents of either disengagement or escalation fill the vacuum left by ill-defined or unattainable goals. The former proved surprisingly successful in holding up U.S. assistance for six-plus months. The latter camp, meanwhile, is ascending. After all, if the present trajectory is unfavorable and adopting more limited aims is ruled out, policymakers will seek the other logical solution: that of expanding involvement in the conflict.\n\nThe West has gradually escalated over the past two years, as has Russia. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine and its Western supporters have pushed for ever more advanced weapons. From support vehicles to tanks, tube artillery to ATACMS, the cycle was consistent: As soon as the White House approved one system, pressure would mount to supply the next. A similar trend played out in Europe. Yet with the third year of the conflict underway, technological exhaustion is imposing an upper limit on this trend. In many areas, there is now no \"next system\" to send.\n\nThis dynamic helps explain the recent discussion of more intensive forms of involvement. Just last week, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron told reporters that Ukraine could use British-provided weapons to strike targets inside Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron renewed his recent suggestion that he might send troops to Ukraine to serve in behind-the-lines roles. Each of these was a distinctly escalatory proposal that even six months ago would not have happened. On Monday, citing the British and French statements, Russia announced it would hold drills to practice the battlefield use of tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nAnother proposal, which the Department of Defense is reportedly considering in some form, is to send greater numbers of U.S. military advisors to Ukraine to provide maintenance support, training, and tactical advice. This is likewise portrayed as a middle step between the status quo and entering the conflict directly. But it's also dangerous, creating the potential for direct conflict with Russian forces should advisors be killed or wounded. Russia, for its part, may view the measure as a precursor to greater Western involvement and escalate in turn. The experience of the Vietnam war -- where advisors proved to be steppingstones to full combat -- ought to serve as a warning.\n\nOf course, the intent of recent calls for intensified Western involvement is to improve the balance of power between Ukraine and Russia. But if a vast infusion of Western technology over the last two years has not resolved Ukraine's weakness vis-\u00e0-vis Russia, then neither advisors nor behind-the-lines support would likely change this dynamic.\n\nFor all the effort the Biden administration has put into delivering aid to Ukraine, it has also set U.S. strategy on autopilot. There appears to be no plan other than to try to keep the money flowing -- the new aid could last as little as six months or as long as 18 months -- which will work until it doesn't.\n\nInstead, the administration should publicly acknowledge that Ukrainian and American interests are not identical and that Kyiv's stated aim of liberating every inch of Ukrainian territory is not realistically achievable. America's most important interests are to safeguard Ukraine's existence as a sovereign state and to avoid direct conflict with Russia. Each of these should take priority over the further liberation of territory.\n\nAccordingly, U.S. leaders should encourage and incentivize Ukraine to prioritize defense over offense, a process that is already beginning. The last two years have demonstrated the ability of defenders to hold off motivated and more numerous attackers; both sides have experienced slow advances and limited gains when facing dug-in opponents. Washington should channel its assistance into ensuring Ukraine can protect itself, which means more basics like ammunition and fortifications and fewer high-tech offensive systems like ATACMS. It should also help Ukraine to rebuild its military-industrial base.\n\nNo less important, the time has come to encourage negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. If Ukrainian forces, buoyed by new aid deliveries, can stabilize the front line, then the summer of 2024 may prove to be a favorable negotiating window. Up to this point, the Biden administration has been wary of pushing Ukraine to negotiate for fear of appearing to signal a lack of U.S. commitment. In addition, negotiations can be slow, and Russia may not yet be willing to participate in earnest. But the proposition has not been tested, and it is worth trying, particularly because punting the decision to Kyiv, while supplying it with arms, has the perverse effect of discouraging Ukraine from talking. Neither side can truly gauge what it could obtain until it starts talking to the other, and recent revelations about prior negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow suggest that a settlement is not impossible.\n\nFinally, Washington should lean on its European allies to spend the money and place the orders to equip Ukraine. America's commitments may falter, whether because of popular dissatisfaction, a new president, or crises elsewhere in the world. Moscow, too, may eschew talks, reasoning that Ukraine's position is only getting weaker. To mitigate these possibilities, Washington should shift more of the burden to European countries whose proximity to Russia give them a strong interest in Ukraine's success. These states have already begun to step up; the Czech Republic, for example, has spearheaded an innovative ammunition initiative. But Europe can do much more: increase national funding for ammunition and rocket production, authorize emergency funds and improve cross-continent defense procurement through the European Union, and take over the organizational burden of coordinating aid.\n\nThis time, Congress eventually delivered. Next time, it might not. On both sides of the Atlantic, governments should prepare for U.S. aid to dry up and work to place Ukraine on a more strategic and durable footing. After all, current levels of support have not sufficed to put the worst outcomes -- whether a Russian breakthrough, a destructive forever conflict, or an expanded war -- out of view. Averting those outcomes requires opening the space to weigh difficult trade-offs now.

It's the first time a European country has held the top spot since Harry S. Truman's administration spent large sums of money rebuilding the continent through the Marshall Plan after World War II.\n\nHow much money did the United States provide to Ukraine?\n\nSince the start of the war, the U.S. Congress has passed five bills to provide continued aid to Ukraine, most recently in April 2024. The total budgetary authority under these bills often figures cited by the media, amounts to 175 billion dollars. These historic sums help a wide range of people and institutions in Ukraine, including refugees, law enforcement and independent broadcasters, although most of the aid is linked to the military. Dozens of other countries, including most members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU), also provide significant aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt is important to note that out of a total of $175 billion, only $107 billion directly helps the Ukrainian government. Most of the remainder funds various U.S. activities related to the war in Ukraine, and a small portion supports other affected countries in the region.\n\nMuch of the money from the aid bills is spent in the United States, paying American factories and workers to produce the various weapons that are either shipped to Ukraine or replenish the American weapons stockpiles on which the Pentagon tapped during the war.

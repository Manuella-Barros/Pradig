Well, if you\u2019re Joey King in \u201cA Family Affair,\u201d you first run into a doorframe. Then, you have a proper meltdown. In the first trailer for the upcoming Netflix film, releasing in June, we\u2019re introduced to King\u2019s character, who\u2019s been working as an assistant to a movie star \u2014 played by Zac Efron \u2014 for two years. And in those two years, she\u2019s learned that he\u2019s \u201cself-absorbed and selfish\u201d and has developed a pretty strong hatred for him. So, when she walks in on him in bed with her mother, played by Nicole Kidman, she naturally freaks out. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hurt her. And I will have to kill him,\u201d she tells someone over the phone. But, it seems Efron and Kidman\u2019s characters may have a real connection that they want to pursue, and Kathy Bates \u2014 Joey King\u2019s grandmother in the film \u2014 is all for it. She may even want him more than her daughter does, the two women joke over Christmas. King\u2019s character will take some convincing though, as she actively works to keep her mom and her boss separated. The rom-com is directed by Oscar nominee Richard Lagravenese (\u201cBeautiful Creatures,\u201d \u201cP.S. I Love You\u201d), and also stars Liza Koshy. You can watch the trailer for the film in the video above. \u201cA Family Affair\u201d hits Netflix on June 28.", "summary": "<p>Richard LaGravenese's Netflix rom-com also stars Kathy Bates and Liza Koshy</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/a-family-affair-trailer-nicole-kidman-zac-efron-joey-king-netflix/\">Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman Fall in Love \u2013 Much to Joey King&#8217;s Chagrin \u2013 in Netflix&#8217;s &#8216;A Family Affair&#8217; Trailer | Video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com\">TheWrap</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/a-family-affair-trailer-nicole-kidman-zac-efron-joey-king-netflix/", "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/netflix-family-affair.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:00", "author": "Andi Ortiz", "authors": ["Andi Ortiz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.486}

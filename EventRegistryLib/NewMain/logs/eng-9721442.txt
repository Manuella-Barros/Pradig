However, in the case of almost 400,000 3-Series models in the U.S., one M accessory could injure or even kill the driver.\n\nBMW has revealed that 2009-2011 BMW 335d, 2006-2012 3-Series Wagon, and 2006-2011 3-Series models, fitted with a sport or M Sport steering wheel, may have been equipped with one of Takata's dreaded airbag inflators. The manufacturer notes that it didn't offer the subject airbag inflator as an official replacement part, but many vehicles may have been installed with them.\n\nRead: 2025 BMW 3-Series Gets More Power And Updated Looks\n\nThe airbag inflator is known as the PSDI-5 and features a propellant that can degrade over years of exposure to high humidity, high temperatures, and high-temperature cycling. If the propellant is altered over time, it can lead to overly aggressive combustion if the airbag is deployed. This could rupture the body of the inflator, sending metal fragments through the airbag material and into the cabin. Occupants could be injured or killed if struck by flying debris.\n\nThe recall impacts a total of 394,029 vehicles. These include 378,263 BMW 323i, 325i, 325xi, 328i, 328xi, 330i, 330xi, 335i, and 335xi models manufactured between February 1, 2005, and December 16, 2011. Also impacted are 5,677 BMW 335d models built from July 25, 2008, to August 11, 2011, and 10,089 BMW 325xi, 328i, and 328xi Wagon models manufactured from August 23, 2005, to May 29, 2012. BMW believes approximately 1% of recalled vehicles may have dangerous Takata airbag inflators.\n\nThe carmaker became aware of a potential issue when models started appearing at dealerships that may have had Takata airbag inflators. BMW says this is because some owners in the U.S. have installed a Sport or M-Sport steering wheel, not knowing it's equipped with the PSDI-5 inflators that were recalled a decade ago.\n\nBMW will notify owners of the recall on August 23, asking them to take their vehicles to a dealership for inspection.

The cars could have dangerous Takata airbags in their steering wheels, but but weirdly, the recall isn't targeting airbags installed by the factory. The automaker discovered that owners may have inadvertently installed an unauthorized Takata airbag if they had replaced the original steering wheel with the sport or M-sport option, and it's issuing the recall out of an abundance of caution.\n\nThe recall covers a range of model years, body styles, and powertrains. Most of the recall, some 378,263 cars, are the 2006-2011 BMW 323i, 325i, 325xi, 328i, 328xi, 330i, 330xi, 335i, and 335xi models. BMW is also checking the 2006-2012 BMW 3 Series SportWagon, which involves 10,089 325xi, 328i, and 328xi cars, while some 5,677 2009-2011 335d owners will have to trek into their dealer's service center.\n\nBMW began investigating these older 3 Series models after non-US dealers started to report that some cars were arriving for service with a potentially affected inflator even though they hadn't been part of any recalls, according to the recall report. The company then confirmed that an owner in the US who had replaced their car's original steering wheel with the sport or M-sport option could have installed the unapproved airbag inflator.\n\nBMW says it's unaware of any accidents or injuries related to this issue, but that doesn't negate its need for proper due diligence. Automakers have been dealing with the Takata airbag recalls since 2013. The scandal involves approximately 67 million inflators in tens of millions of vehicles that were sold by nearly every automaker in the US.\n\nThe ammonium nitrate propellant in these airbags can degrade over time when exposed to long-term temperature changes, high heat, and high humidity, potentially causing the inflator to explode during deployment and jettison shrapnel into the passenger compartment. The inflators have killed 27 people in the US, and older cars are especially dangerous. BMW even issued a do-not-drive order for 90,000 early 2000s models, joining Nissan, Toyota, and others in motivating owners to fix their cars.\n\nCheck out the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's dedicated landing page to learn more about the Takata airbag recall.", "source": {"uri": "motor1.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Motor1.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takata_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takata Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BMW 3 Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_body_style", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car body style"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW 3 Series (E30)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_wagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Station wagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_nitrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammonium nitrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/1ZKVb9/s3/2009-bmw-3-series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721442", "eventUri": "eng-9721442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Owners will be notified by mail starting August 23, and BMW dealers will inspect and replace the affected airbag modules free of charge.\n\nThis issue is part of a broader problem with Takata airbags, which have been linked to numerous recalls across various automakers due to the risk of inflator rupture caused by long-term exposure to fluctuating high temperatures and humidity.

While Takata recalls are of course far from news at this point and BMW has carried out its own campaigns on affected cars in the past, there's a bit of a twist this time around: this one concerns a popular owner modification.\n\nIn 2015, BMW, among many other automakers, issued recalls for swaths of vehicles containing Takata airbags with potentially lethal inflators. Since then, countless BMWs have had their airbags replaced free of charge at dealers. Unfortunately, it seems the manufacturer has reason to believe there are still a number of 3 Series out there it didn't or was unable to catch, because their owners exchanged their vehicles' stock steering wheels for upgraded M Sport units that contained the very same dangerous airbags.\n\nAccording to the report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 394,029 vehicles \"may contain a sport or M-sport steering wheel equipped with a Takata driver's front air bag module that contains a PSDI-5 inflator that could have been installed by an owner, even though it was not officially offered/ approved by BMW as a replacement part.\"\n\nNon-U.S. BMW dealerships reportedly found some customer cars, while in for service, that had faulty Takata airbags despite the vehicles not being part of the initial recall. That led BMW to suspect that owners were swapping out steering wheels with unapproved ones, so the company is now simply recalling all E90s to have their wheels inspected for bad airbags. Of the nearly 400,000 vehicles being recalled, BMW estimates that only 1% of them are defective. Per the official Safety Recall Report released by NHTSA, the automaker made this determination by cross-referencing \"vehicle production information\" with release dates for the \"sport and M-sport steering wheel spare parts\" to settle on a start and end date for at-risk sedans, coupes, convertibles, and wagons.\n\nIf exposed to heat and humidity over several years, certain components inside the faulty airbag inflators can degrade, causing excessive pressure when it deploys. That increased pressure can send metal shrapnel through the airbag and toward passengers. There have been more than 30 reported deaths from Takata's defective airbags worldwide.\n\nOwners of any BMWs involved in the recall will be notified. However, if you're one such owner and your haven't replaced your steering wheel, you're likely in the clear. It's obviously still worth bringing your car in for the recall service, as you might not know what its previous owner did. E90s are almost 20 years old now, so there aren't too many still in original hands.", "source": {"uri": "thedrive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Drive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nico_demattia@thedrive.com", "name": "Nico DeMattia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takata_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Takata Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BMW 3 Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Highway Traffic Safety Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coupe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convertible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Repair", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/bmw-3-series-e90-3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721442", "eventUri": "eng-9721442", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

That's the number of Takata airbag inflators recalled in the U.S. by the NHTSA since 2019, affecting tens of millions of vehicles across several automakers, the agency said. This is the largest series of automotive recalls in U.S. history, in addition to another 33 million airbags recalled worldwide. While most airbag inflators have been installed in passenger cars, they have also been equipped on trucks manufactured by Daimler and Ferrari's luxury vehicles, according to the NHTSA.\n\nNissan issued a \"Do Not Drive\" warning to the owners of nearly 84,000 vehicles equipped with Takata's airbag inflators in May. An exploding front-passenger inflator killed one person driving a 2006 Nissan Sentra in 2018, according to Nissan, which previously recalled over 736,000 cars with the inflators in 2020. Ford, Dodge, BMW and Chrysler, among other automakers, have issued similar warnings to drivers in recent years.\n\nSeveral automakers have issued recalls for cars equipped with defective Takata airbag inflators over the last decade. The Transportation Department fined Takata $200 million for the inflators in 2016, the largest civil penalty ever handed out by the agency, which requested regulators to preserve all recalled inflators for a federal investigation. The NHTSA has been asked by the agency to test all recovered inflators. Takata filed for bankruptcy in 2017, following years of regulatory scrutiny.\n\nStellantis issued a recall on Wednesday for 332,000 vehicles equipped with front seat airbags that may not deploy as intended during a crash, increasing the risk of injury.

NHSTA says 67 units have been recalled, saying it's the biggest auto safety recall in history.\n\nNow, BMW is recalling 394,000 models because of the same safety issue. Officials say they believe the bags can explode because they utilize a metal cartridge loaded with ammonium nitrate (which blasts the bag into shape) but didn't use a stabilizer agent. In short, when the bags inflate, or possibly accidentally explode, they can scatter metal shrapnel into the driver and passengers.\n\n\"In the event of an inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the air bag cushion material, which may result in injury or death to vehicle occupants,\" BMW said in the recall report.\"\n\nDealers will replace the affected units for free, owners are urged to contact their dealer if they have one of the affected models listed by the company.\n\nTakata, a Japanese airbag manufacturer, is no longer in business. In 2018, they sold out to Key Safety Systems, which then combined with Takata to form Joyson Safety Systems.

For BMW, the problem, which potentially affects 394,029 cars, is a continuation of the Takata airbag recall, the largest automotive recall in history. Stellantis has slightly fewer potentially affected cars, with 322,000 subject to recall, but for different problem caused by a suspect sensor in the seat belt buckle.\n\nBMW\n\nWhile the BMW recall will be sent to almost 400,000 owners, the company suspects only 1 percent of that population will have a problem that needs remedying. That's because it wants dealers to check any cars where the owner has replaced the factory-fitted steering wheel with a Sport or M-Sport version equipped with a PSDI-5 inflator.\n\nThese inflators lack a desiccant or drying agent that would otherwise prevent the ammonium nitrate airbag propellant from taking on moisture, degrading the airbag's performance to the point where it could overinflate and shower the interior with metal fragments. At least 24 people have been killed by defective Takata airbags in the US, which led to 42 million cars being recalled to fix the problem.\n\nBMW's recall affects the model year 2006-11 323i, 325i, 330i, 330Xi, 335i, 335Xi; the model year 2006-12 325Xi, 328i, 328Xi; and the model year 2009-11 335d. Should inspection find a replacement wheel with a Takata inflator, it will be replaced with a new airbag module, BMW says.\n\nStellantis\n\nThe Stellantis recall appears to affect cars produced in Italy: the model year 2017-24 Alfa Romeo Giulia, model year 2018-24 Alfa Romeo Stelvio, model year 2024 Fiat 500E, model year 2019-23 Fiat 500X, and model year 2019-23 Jeep Renegade.\n\nHere, the problem is not an airbag inflator but the Hall effect sensor, supplied by ZF, on the seat belt buckle -- or, more specifically, the wiring that connects that sensor to the car's internal network. Suspect connectors were used in different models at different times, some as early as 2016 and some as late as this June. In cars with faulty Hall effect sensor wiring, the airbag may not trigger during a crash.\n\nStellantis says that dealers will directly wire the sensor to the wiring harness with a solder tube in affected cars.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_m_gitlin@arstechnica.com", "name": "Jonathan M.

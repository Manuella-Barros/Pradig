A detailed and elaborate consultation was necessary before these laws were passed but that did not happen,\" Setalvad said while speaking at an event on the topic 'India's New Criminal Laws: Reform or Repression?'Certain provisions of the law that were amended after human rights and legal movements have been reintroduced in the name of decolonization, she claimed.These laws \"militate against participating democracy and the democratic fabric of the nation\" and \"aspire towards Hindu rashtra\", Setalvad asserted.Others speakers at the event, Vrinda Grover and Vijay Hiremath, too opposed the new laws.Emphasising the danger of \"routinisation of extraordinary provisions\", Grover said some safeguards in the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) will no longer be available.The new laws are more draconian than the existing ones, Hiremath said.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/new-criminal-laws-mockery-of-constitution-teesta-setalvad-1308612", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/29/1100356-teesta-youtube.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:07:50", "author": "PTI", "authors": ["PTI"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.624}

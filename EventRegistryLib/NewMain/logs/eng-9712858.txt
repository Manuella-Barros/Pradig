BCCI Informs ICC Of Its Decision", "body": "One of the burning questions in the cricket world is whether India travel to Pakistan for the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025 or not. And finally, the BCCI has informed the ICC of its decision and the chances of Pakistani fans seeing Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma playing in their stadiums are nil.\n\nPakistan was given the hosting rights for the ICC Champions Trophy, which is being revived after 7 years. The Men in Green are the defending champions as well, as they defeated India in the final of the last tournament which was held in England in 2017.\n\nThis will be the first big ICC event Pakistan has hosted since the 1996 World Cup. However, the question remained whether India would come to Pakistan given their troubled political and geographic relations. India has not visited Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup.\n\nA bilateral series from December 2012 to January 2013 in India also marked the final bilateral series between the two nations. Since then, both nations have only clashed at ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. India also didn't travel for the 2023 Asia Cup, playing its matches in Sri Lanka, while Pakistan was the official host.\n\nThe ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled from February to March 2025 in Pakistan.\n\nBCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla said in May that the Indian team would be sent to Pakistan for the tournament only if the central government permits it.\n\n\"In the case of the Champion Trophy, we will do whatever the Government of India will tell us to do. We send our team only when the Government of India permits us. So we will go according to the decision of the Indian government,\" Shukla had said.\n\nMeanwhile, a few days back, the Pakistan Cricket Board had proposed to India to play all its matches in one city, Lahore, and even the draft schedule that PCB submitted to ICC sees India playing all its matches in Lahore, with their clash against Pakistan scheduled for March 1.\n\nThe Indian team will not travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 and will ask the International Cricket Council to hold its matches in Sri Lanka or Dubai, a BCCI source told ANI.\n\n\"India will not travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025. Will tell ICC to hold its matches in Dubai or Sri Lanka,\" a BCCI source was quoted as saying by ANI.\n\nThe Champions Trophy will be the second international competition to be held outside of Pakistan in the past two years due to India's refusal to travel there if Sri Lanka or the United Arab Emirates wins it. All of India's matches for the Asia Cup 2023 were held in Sri Lanka, while all other matches were also held there in a hybrid format.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportzwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ind-v-PAK.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-12-", "dateEnd": "2013-01-", "textStart": 846, "textEnd": 875}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 1905, "textEnd": 1912}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

Big Revelation Unveiled", "body": "It is learnt that amidst strained relations, the Indian cricket team would prefer ICC Champions Trophy 2025 matches in Sri Lanka or Dubai rather than in Pakistan.\n\nIND vs PAK Champions Trophy 2025: According to a BCCI source who spoke to ANI, the Indian team would want the matches of the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025 to be played in Sri Lanka or Dubai instead of Pakistan, ensured the International Cricket Council. The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled to take place in Pakistan in February and March next year. India has not featured in any cricket event in Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup because of strained relations between the two nations.\n\nBilateral Series History\n\nThe two nations' most recent bilateral series took place in India from December 2012 to January 2013.. Since then, matches between the two nations were only held during ICC competitions and the Asia Cup. Due to relations between the two nations, doubt has overshadowed India's participation in the upcoming tournament.\n\nIndia's cricket board had suggested to Pakistan that all of their matches would be held in one city, according to a report by ESPNcricinfo that identifies Lahore as the venue that will host all of India's matches, but the idea of visiting Pakistan does not go down well with the Indian board. Source, told ANI that, \"India will not travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025. Will tell ICC to hold its matches in Dubai or Sri Lanka.\"\n\nGovernment Approval Needed\n\nRecently in May, BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla had said that the Indian team would travel to Pakistan only if the country's central government allows it. Speaking to the ANI, Shukla said, \"In the case of the Champion Trophy, we will do whatever the Government of India will tell us to do. We send our team only when the Government of India permits us. So we will go according to the decision of the Indian government.\"\n\nHybrid Hosting and Pakistan's Recent Cricket Diplomacy\n\nThe case was the same in regard to last year's Asia Cup and was to be held in Pakistan, but PCB finally had to take on a hybrid model of hosting the Asia Cup with all India matches, including ones against Pakistan, being played in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe final of that tournament had been won by India in Colombo. Only a few months back, there were reports of Pakistan considering a hybrid model for participation in last year's ODI World Cup in India. That never came into consideration. Last held in 2017, Pakistan is the reigning champion of the Champions Trophy.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_goel@dnpindia.in", "name": "Sparsh Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IND-vs-PAK-Champions-Trophy-2025.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-12-", "dateEnd": "2013-01-", "textStart": 752, "textEnd": 781}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Will tell ICC to hold its matches in Dubai or Sri Lanka,\" a BCCI source was quoted as saying by ANI.\n\nThis decision comes after Pakistan proposed hosting all of India's matches in one city to minimize their travel, suggesting Lahore as the location. However, the Indian board has declined this offer. The ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled to take place from February to March 2025 in Pakistan. India has not participated in any cricket tournaments in Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup due to strained relations between the two countries.\n\nThe last bilateral series between India and Pakistan took place from December 2012 to January 2013 in India. Since then, the two nations have only competed against each other in ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. If the Champions Trophy is relocated to Sri Lanka or the UAE, it would be the second multi-nation tournament in two years to be moved out of Pakistan due to India's reluctance to travel there. The Asia Cup 2023 was played in a hybrid model, with all of India's matches held in Sri Lanka while the rest of the tournament was hosted by Pakistan.\n\nIn May, BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla stated that the Indian team would travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy only if permitted by the Indian central government. \"In the case of the Champions Trophy, we will do whatever the Government of India will tell us to do. We send our team only when the Government of India permits us. So we will go according to the decision of the Indian government.\"\n\nPakistan are the defending champions of the Champions Trophy, having last won the tournament in 2017. The eight-nation Champions Trophy is scheduled to be held in Pakistan in February and March 2025, marking the first major cricket event in Pakistan since the 1996 World Cup, which it co-hosted with India and Sri Lanka. The match dates for the competition, running from February 19 to March 9, are yet to be announced. India is set to play six ODIs - three against Sri Lanka in an away series and three at home against England in early February before the Champions Trophy.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hockey Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asia Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lahore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/11/1436661-indvspakct2025.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-19", "dateEnd": "-03-09", "textStart": 2315, "textEnd": 2337}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-12-", "dateEnd": "2013-01-", "textStart": 1051, "textEnd": 1080}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

While Pakistan proposed hosting all of India's matches in one city, presumably Lahore, to minimize travel, the BCCI is not comfortable traveling to Pakistan at all.\n\nIndia cricket team's reluctance is rooted in the ongoing political tensions between the two nations. Since the 2008 Asia Cup, India has not played any cricket tournaments hosted by Pakistan. Bilateral series haven't happened either, with the last one dating back to December 2012-January 2013 in India.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time India's stance has impacted a tournament's location. The 2023 Asia Cup was held in a \"hybrid\" format due to the same issue.

Although the International Cricket Council has granted Pakistan to host the Champions Trophy, the political tensions with neighbouring country India will further dent the hopes for Pakistan to host a major tournament in a full-fledged manner.\n\nAccording to reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) submitted a draft schedule to the ICC, wherein India was noted to play their fixture against the reigning champions in Lahore, though the groups weren't mentioned. The Indian team's travel is only feasible with subject to the Indian government's approval.\n\nAccording to a recent report by India Today, India will opt to play in a hybrid model similar to that of Asia Cup 2023 with their matches likely to be staged in either the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or Sri Lanka.\n\n\"It is highly unlikely that the team will travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy but a final will be taken by the government. So, in that case, a hybrid model is being worked out,\" a source in the scheme of development was quoted as saying by India Today.\n\n\"India may play their matches in UAE or Sri Lanka just like the Asia Cup. Although the ICC will also have their stand on it, as of now this is what we are thinking of. Let's see how things go in the future. As of now, it looks like it will be played in a hybrid model,\" the source further added.\n\nIndia played all their Asia Cup 2023 fixtures in Sri Lanka with the BCCI enforcing a hybrid model even though Pakistan was initially awarded complete hosting rights of the tournament. Consequently, Pakistan hosted just four out of the 13 fixtures of the Asia Cup last year.\n\nIndia and Pakistan cricket teams have been hit by the rift political relations over the years. The last time the two rivals played a bilateral series was in 2013 following which their meetings are only limited to global events such as Asia Cups and World Cups.\n\nIt should be noted that Pakistan travelled to India for the 2023 World Cup given that it was an ICC event. It will be key to observe what call does the ICC have to take in case the Indian cricket board officially refuse to travel to their neighbouring nation.

During the World Championship of Legends match between Yuvraj Singh-led India Champions and Younis Khan-led Pakistan Champions, the two sets of fans took a moment and cheered for the England men's football team during its Euro 2024 quarter-final against Switzerland.\n\nEngland and Switzerland were locked at 1-1 at the end of 90 minutes in their Euro 2024 quarter-final match in Dusseldorf, Germany. It was not possible to separate the two teams at the end of extra time following which England won 5-3 on penalties to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nIn a video that is going viral on social media, India and Pakistan cricket team fans can be seen following England's Euro 2024 match on TV screens at Edgbaston on Saturday. The two sets of fans can be seen cheering together for Gareth Southgate's men and celebrating the Three Lions's win in the thrilling quarter-final.\n\nIn a game of few chances, Breel Embolo had put Switzerland ahead after 75 minutes, with Bukayo Saka brilliantly leveling five minutes later. In the penalty shootout, England players found the back of the net without any hiccup while Jordan Pickford shone between the goalposts to help them storm into the semi-final. England will take on the Netherlands in the second semi-final while France and Spain will meet in the other semi-final.\n\nAt Edgbaston, there was more to cheer for Pakistan cricket fans as Younis Khan's side hammered India by 68 runs after posting 243 on the board. Kamran Akmal and Sharjeel Khan hit 70s to help Pakistan post a massive total in 20 overs in Birmingham in the much-anticipated contest in the tournament for legendary retired players.\n\nSuresh Raina hit a fifty, but India managed just 175 for 9 in their quota of 20 overs. It was the first defeat for India in the six-team tournament. Pakistan are currently on top of the points table with 3 wins in as many games, while India are 3rd with 2 wins in 3 games.

At one point, it seemed an easygoing for Pakistan but the Indian bowlers had other ideas. Led by Jasprit Bumrah, the bowlers produced a stunning display to leave Pakistan short.\n\nWatch: Harbhajan Singh confronts Kamran Akmal as the duo involved in animated chat after latter's controversial comment on Sikhs\n\nYounis Khan is currently playing in the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2024, which is being played at Edgbaston, Birmingham. India and Pakistan came up against each other on Saturday (July 6) where Pakistan trumped India by 68 runs.\n\nAfter the match, Younis Khan was asked to speak about the prospect of having more India-Pakistan matches in the upcoming future. Younis responded by saying that there should be more India-Pakistan matches so that the pressure is less on the players. He also cited the example during his times when India and Pakistan used to play regularly and the pressure was less on both teams.\n\n\"We are playing every match like a normal match. As a captain, it doesn't matter to me who the opponent is. Media hypes such things and when I arrived at the ground today, it seemed like I'm playing an international match during my days. So, it's a good thing when India-Pakistan matches happen. Such matches should be on a regular basis,\" Younis said after the WCL match between India and Pakistan.\n\n\"We used to play regularly against India during our playing days. As a result, the pressure was less on us. Now, when our young team plays in World Cups or any ICC event, the pressure is more on them. According to me, the series should happen so that there is less pressure and players can use their skills more during a game,\" Younis added.\n\nTalking about the WCL match, Pakistan scored a mammoth 243-4 in 20 overs. Pakistan's top three Kamran Akmal, Sharjeel Khan, and Sohaib Maqsood scored blistering half-centuries to take their team to a mammoth total.\n\nIn reply, India were reduced to just 175-9 in 20 overs. Suresh Raina scored the only half-century for India with 52 off 40 balls. Ambati Rayudu and Robin Uthappa also contributed with quick cameos but India fell well short of the target.\n\nWith this win, Pakistan Champions moved to the top of the points table with three wins in as many games.

Pakistan are the official hosts of the tournament and have already proposed a tentative schedule for the showpiece event which is set to be played in February-March next year.\n\nA report in the Telegraph UK has revealed the proposed schedule by the PCB for Champions Trophy 2025. As per the proposed schedule, hosts Pakistan will square off against New Zealand in the tournament opener on February 19. The marquee clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan has been scheduled for March 01 at the Gadaffi Stadium in Lahore.\n\nAnother blockbuster clash between England and Australia will be played in Lahore on February 22. All of India's matches have been scheduled in Lahore as per the proposed schedule. Meanwhile, Rawalpindi and Karachi have been roped in as the other two venues for the multi-national tournament which will be a significant event for Pakistan.\n\nThe Champions Trophy 2025 is the first major ICC event being hosted by Pakistan since the 1996 ODI World Cup. The top eight teams who will be taking part in the showpiece event have been divided into groups of four each as per the proposed schedule. Arch-rivals India and Pakistan are in Group A along with Bangladesh and New Zealand.\n\nGroup B consists of reigning ODI world champions Australia along with England, South Africa and Afghanistan. The first semi-final of the Champions Trophy 2025 will be played on March 05 followed by the second semi-final in Rawalpindi on March 06. The final of the tournament will be played in Lahore on March 09.\n\nThe tentative schedule proposed by the PCB is subject to approval from both the BCCI and the ICC. It remains to be seen if the BCCI will allow the Indian team to travel to Pakistan for the event. As per reports, the Indian cricket board is unlikely to send the team to Pakistan considering the strained political relations between the two countries.\n\nThe BCCI had refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup last year which led to the tournament being staged in a hybrid model. The board has maintained that the final decision on India's travel plans will depend on the government. If BCCI refuses to send Indian team to Pakistan, the tournament will have to be played in a hybrid model with India playing their matches at a neutral venue.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com",

Having secured the hosting rights, Pakistan submitted a draft schedule to the International Cricket Council (ICC) last month.\n\nHowever, the proposed plan, which includes India's matches in Lahore, is now under scrutiny due to geopolitical considerations.\n\nAccording to sources close to the matter, it is highly unlikely that the Indian team will travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.

So, in that case, a hybrid model is being worked out. India may play their UAE or Sri Lanka matches just like the Asia Cup.

A BCCI source informed ANI on Thursday morning that \"India will not travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy 2025.\"\n\nThe BCCI source added that the International Cricket Council (ICC) would be notified by the Indian board to move its matches to Dubai or Sri Lanka.\n\nAbdullah feels that Pakistan must also do its part to foster improved ties with India; he does not think that India bears the entire burden of doing so.\n\n\"What is new in this? Both countries have not played bilateral series for many years, it is BCCI's own decision not to go for the tournament. I have always said that it is not only our country's responsibility to establish better relations between these two countries, if better relations are to be made then it is Pakistan's responsibility too,\" Abdullah told reporters, as per ANI.\n\n\"The kind of attacks that are happening should not happen, the kind of atmosphere that is there should not be there, Pakistan will also have to play its role in this so that the relations between the two countries improve,\" he added.\n\nBecause of the strained relations between the two countries, India has not participated in any cricket competitions in Pakistan since the 2008 Asia Cup.\n\nThe last bilateral series between the two countries took place in India from December 2012 to January 2013. Only at ICC competitions and the Asia Cup have the two countries faced off since then.\n\nIndia's cricket board had suggested to Pakistan that all of their matches be held in one city. According to a report by ESPNcricinfo, Lahore has been selected as the venue for all of India's matches. But the idea of visiting Pakistan does not appeal to the Indian board.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

The Indian batters and bowlers put up a flop show against Pakistan Champions who dented them with their first loss of the tournament. Pakistan have climbed to the top with three wins on the trot while India sit third with two wins and a loss.\n\nAll the six participating teams except West Indies and South Africa have played three games each and have two more games left that could decide their fate. Talking about India Champions, they too have two more games left - against the legends of Australia and South Africa. Although India's road ahead after the heartbreaking loss, looks a bit difficult but the hopes aren't over yet for the retired Men in Blue.\n\nA win in either of the remaining two games will strengthen their claim for a semi-final spot but then it will be narrowed down to the probabilities of other teams either losing or winning and the margins as well for the net run rate (NRR). Four teams are bound to qualify for the penultimate stage and considering Team India's opponents - Australia and South Africa, their path surely won't be easy to book a semi-final berth. However, if they end up winning both of their remaining games, a semi-final place could be guaranteed.\n\nIndia started their campaign taking on England Champions and beat them by three wickets as they comfortably chased down 166 on the back of Robin Uthappa who hit a fifty. England were invited to bat first and scored 165/4 in 20 overs as Ian Bell and Samit Patel's half-centuries went in vain.\n\nThe Yuvraj Singh-led side then faced West Indies Champions and won the game by 27 runs via the DLS method. West Indies invited India to bat first as Gurkeerat Singh struck an unbeaten 86 and Uthappa, Yuvraj, Suresh Raina, and Irfan Pathan chipped in with valuable contributions. India posted 229/5 in 20 overs but West Indies' (31/1 in 5.3 overs) chase was thwarted by rain and India were adjudged the ultimate winners.\n\nIn the Pakistan clash, India opted to bowl and leaked 243 runs (at the cost of 4 wickets in 20 overs) to get a mammoth of target to chase. The Indian bowlers put up a flop show as Kamran Akmal, Sharjeel Khan, and Sohaib Maqsood hit fifties and helped Pakistan post a hefty total. India's chase (175/9 in 20 overs) didn't live up to the expectations as Suresh Raina's fifty went in vain and Pakistan bowlers struck at regular intervals to deny India a third consecutive win.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_sharma@news9live.com", "name": "Amit Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_run_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Net run rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgbaston_Cricket_Ground", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvraj_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yuvraj Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Uthappa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robin Uthappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohaib_Maqsood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sohaib Maqsood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamran_Akmal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamran Akmal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irfan_Pathan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irfan Pathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharjeel_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sharjeel Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samit_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samit Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suresh_Raina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suresh Raina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bhajji-Yuvi-Birmingham-Legends-League.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

I have always said that it is not only our country's responsibility to establish better relations between these two countries; if better relations are to be made, then it is Pakistan's responsibility too.\"\n\n\"The kind of attacks that are happening should not happen, and the kind of atmosphere that is there should not be there.

Last year, Pakistan hosted the Asia Cup, but India, the ultimate victors, were permitted to play all of their matches in Sri Lanka under a \"hybrid model\" set by the organizers. India claimed that their government had not granted them permission to visit Pakistan for the Asia Cup.\n\nThe eight-nation Champions Trophy tournament is scheduled to be held in Pakistan in February and March next year. This will be the first major cricket event in Pakistan since it co-hosted the 1996 World Cup with India and Sri Lanka.

India and Pakistan have a heated rivalry, especially when it comes to cricket, but they put that aside to watch Trent Alexander-Arnold smash England through to the Euro 2024 semi-finals. Gareth Southgate's men will now face Netherlands in the semi-final.\n\nWith a clip of Formula One drivers, George Russell and Lewis Hamilton, uniting with a packed Silverstone crowd to enjoy the football going viral online, cricket fans have taken it one step further, with Indian and Pakistani fans uniting in their love for the England football team in a viral clip.\n\nEdgbaston Stadium, located in Birmingham, England, was playing host to a sold out 23,000 crowd this past Saturday, in the World Championships of Legends, as a highly-anticipated match-up between India and Pakistan's cricket teams was happening.\n\nThe event is a T20-styled tournament, in which retired international cricketers reunite to represent their country. With the event ongoing, both India and Pakistan were unbeaten before their meeting, with India having dispatched of England and West Indies Champions, and Pakistan defeating Australia and Windies Champions.\n\nIndia & Pakistan's Rivalry\n\nIn a rivalry that is renowned for its ferocity, it is birthed from real life conflict, as despite the litany of similarities India and Pakistan have, the countries have fought three wars since the latter's creation in 1947. With cricket being embedded in the culture of these two countries, the rivalry that began in the real world, has spread into cricket, resulting in one of the fiercest rivalries in the history of sport.\n\nDespite both sides' unbeaten start to the World Championship of Legends, one of their unbeaten records had to come to an end sooner or later, and that fate fell sadly to India Champions, who lost by 68 runs to their fierce rivals. It puts Pakistan top of the table, being the only team to boast a hat-trick of wins.\n\nWith an ongoing tournament in which they are facing each other, and the aforementioned rivalry steeped in years of conflict, it appears there is something that can unite both fans of India and Pakistan cricket teams, and that is the England national football team.\n\nEngland Beat Switzerland at Euro 2024\n\nWith the match between India and Pakistan taking place in Birmingham, chances are a lot of the fans in attendance are British natives with family ties to both India and Pakistan, and because of this, it resulted in an incredibly wholesome and incredible clip in which both sets of fans can be seen coexisting, as they watched nervously at the England national team's penalty shootout.\n\nIn a clip that boasts nearly six million views in 14 hours, and over 40,000 likes, a packed out concourse of Pakistan and India shirts can be seen staring up at the screen as Trent Alexander-Arnold stepped up to take the decisive penalty kick. Thankfully for them, Trent managed to swoop the ball home, and it was greeted by a joyous reception with fans of both cricket teams embracing one another over their common interest, as for a split second, any cricketing rivalry fell to the back burner.\n\nRelated Lewis Hamilton & George Russell React to England Beating Switzerland\n\nMercedes duo Lewis Hamilton & George Russell were watching England vs Switzerland at Euro 2024 at Silverstone after qualifying.\n\nIt is incredibly wholesome viewing, and shows the power that the England national team have in uniting people. However, any love for England from Pakistan cricket fans will fall by the wayside for the day, as their side faces England Champions in the World Championship of Legends next.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgbaston_Cricket_Ground", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Russell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Russell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverstone_Circuit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silverstone Circuit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Snooker_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Snooker Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-07-jul-2024-10-07-am-5911.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Both the high-profile encounters are set to be hosted by Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium. Meanwhile, Rawalpindi and Karachi are the two other host cities, allotted multiple matches for the multinational tournament.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the hosts will be seen squaring off against New Zealand on February 19 for the tournament opener, while the last group stage encounter will be played between England and South Africa at Rawalpindi on March 02.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Secretary Jay Shah has asserted that decisions regarding tours to the country are guided by the Government of India.

In planning the schedule, Pakistan has aimed to minimize logistical complexities for India. India's three group-stage matches against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and Pakistan are scheduled in Lahore, conveniently located just hours from the Indian border and easily accessible by road.\n\nAmong the teams in the preliminary schedule, India is the only one not required to relocate venues between their group-stage fixtures. The Pakistan Cricket Board hopes that this strategic scheduling will encourage Indian supporters to travel and rally behind their team.", "source": {"uri": "crictracker.com", "dataType": "news",

He also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of diverting people's attention from recent terror attacks in the country through 'cricket diplomacy'.\n\n\"I am astonished that at a time when soldiers of the country are being killed in the line of duty, the leadership of the country was waiting for BCCI to react, when the reaction should have come from Defence Minister (Rajnath Singh) or Prime Minister (Narendra Modi)... As mortal remains of our soldiers are coming back, the Prime Minister of the country is giving political statements during his travels to Austria and Russia. He is not speaking a single word on the martyrdom of our soldiers,\" Pratapgarhi said.\n\nThe Congress leader's statement came at a time when seven security personnel lost their lives to terror in Jammu and Kashmir in over the past three days, close on the heels of four back-to-back terror attacks in June.\n\nPratapgarhi further questioned why the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was sending Team India for Champions Trophy to Pakistan in the first place.\n\n\"Why was BCCI sending the team to Pakistan in first place? Did the government decide that our team will go to Pakistan for tournament as part of 'cricket diplomacy'...I think this government completely failed in terms of its foreign policies,\" he said.\n\n\"Martyrdom of soldiers has nothing to do with cricket. We don't take revenge through cricket and films... in the past 10 years, this government has done just that. They just diverted people's attention from the issues,\" the Congress leader added.\n\nNational Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah also reacted to the development and said if better relations are to be established with Pakistan, then the neighbouring country will also have to play its role in the process.\n\n\"What is new in this? Both countries have not played bilateral series for many years, it is BCCI's own decision not to go for the tournament. I have always said that it is not only our country's responsibility to establish better relations between these two countries, if better relations are to be made then it is Pakistan's responsibility too. The kind of attacks that are happening should not happen, the kind of atmosphere that is there should not be there, Pakistan will also have to play its role in this so that the relations between the two countries improve,\" Abdullah said.\n\nThe Indian cricket team, under the leadership of Rohit Sharma, is unlikely to travel to Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy as the BCCI is advocating for the matches to be relocated to either Sri Lanka or Dubai.

The tournament is likely to be played between February 19 and March 9 with March 10 stated to be the reserve day. The hosting rights for the whole tournament have been given to Pakistan.\n\nWatch: Dhruv Jurel becomes MS Dhoni on the latter's birthday, hits bullseye to dismiss Wellington Masakadza\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the marquee clash between India and Pakistan will be played on March 1. Lahore's iconic Gaddafi Stadium is likely to host this big game. All of India's matches will be held in Lahore due to logistical reasons.\n\nThe Men in Blue will open their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20. Afterwards, they will play New Zealand on February 23. After a big gap of six days, they will be up against the home side Pakistan on March 1.\n\nIt is understood that the PCB has submitted the draft of the 15-match tournament but the Board of Control for Cricket in India is yet to give its consent to the tentative schedule. According to the reports, seven matches will be played in Lahore, five in Rawalpindi, and three in Karachi.\n\nAll the board chiefs of the participating countries have assured Pakistan of full support except the BCCI, which will consult the government of India and inform the ICC.\n\nIt is highly likely that the Government of India to not allow the Indian team to travel to Pakistan due to security reasons. The last time India travelled to Pakistan was in the 2008 Asia Cup.\n\nSince then, the relations between the two countries have gone from bad to worse. If India refuses to travel to Pakistan, the tournament is likely to adopt a hybrid model.\n\nThe last time these two teams played a bilateral series was in 2013 when Pakistan travelled to India for an ODI and a T20I series. The T20I series was drawn 1-1 while Pakistan won the ODI series 2-1.\n\nMeanwhile, India refused to travel to Pakistan in last year's Asia Cup which prompted the tournament to adopt a hybrid model. As a result, all of India's matches in the Asia Cup 2023 were played in Sri Lanka, including the final. India beat Sri Lanka in the final to clinch a record eighth Asia Cup.\n\nBefore the Asia Cup, PCB chairman Ramiz Raja stated that if India doesn't come to Pakistan, then Pakistan won't come to India for the ODI World Cup 2023 as well. However, Pakistan came to participate in the ODI World Cup 2023 and played their matches in five Indian cities, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Ahmedabad.\n\nPakistan had a dismal performance in the tournament and failed to qualify for the semifinals.

There was so much tension on whether the Green Brigade would come to this country for the 2016 T20 World Cup. They did and continued the same process even for last year's Men's ODI World Cup 2023.\n\nThe T20 World Cup winner of the Pakistan side, Younis Khan feels that it's the media that always creates the hype around an India-Pakistan game, and because they used to play each other almost regularly in those past days, the pressure wasn't that much on the players during the ICC major events.\n\nAlso Read: Andy Flower Picks These Five India Batters To Watch Out For In Future\n\nYounis Khan stated that they take every opponent equally and that's what makes it quite easy for the players to remain involved in the contest.\n\n'We are playing one match at a time and on an equal basis. As a captain, I don't have in mind that who should be the opponent.' The veteran Pakistan batter expressed this during a recent interview. 'The media have created some hype.'\n\nThe former players of these few countries are playing the 'World Championship of Legends' league last week at the Edgbaston ground in Birmingham. The retired right-handed batter looked back at that game when they faced India legends and how the whole ground was packed for the afternoon.\n\n'When I came to the ground this afternoon, I looked at the ground, and it felt like I am playing an international game of my old time. That much crowd was there.' Younis Khan added. 'So that's a good thing, when India and Pakistan are facing each other. See, another good thing is that these games should take place on a regular basis.'\n\nThe 46-year-old feels that the lack of bilateral games between these two countries is putting more pressure on the players and because the Pakistan team has a young group of players, they are feeling the pressure more.\n\n'We always think that when we used to play cricket, we were playing India almost regularly, so the pressure on us wasn't that much.' The middle-order batter Younis Khan elaborated. 'But now, I see they play only in World Cups, or in those other major ICC events, and that's why we have pressure given Pakistan have a young team at the moment.'\n\nAlso Read: Ravindra Jadeja Wishes MS Dhoni On His 43rd Birthday; Calls Him Only Favourite Person In Cricket\n\nThe last time both these teams met each other during the T20 World Cup at the Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York, the 2009 champions failed to chase down a low total of 120 runs, and later were knocked out from the group stage of the event.\n\n'In my view, they should play more, so that the pressure won't be that much. The Players should be able to play more with their skills and showcase their character to us.' The Mardan-born Younis Khan concluded.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if India makes a trip to Pakistan for the upcoming Champions Trophy 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sportzwiki.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportzwiki"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younis_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Younis Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Flower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Flower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgbaston_Cricket_Ground", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edgbaston Cricket Ground"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportzwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GOLBVJKaIAA_65T.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712858", "eventUri": "eng-9712858", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

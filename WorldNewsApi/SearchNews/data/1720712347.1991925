{"id": 232005342, "title": "\u2018Toxic and hostile environment for Jewish students\u2019 at UC Irvine, students claim", "text": "For those unwilling to condemn Israel in the harshest terms, he said, the UC Irvine campus has become a hostile and dangerous place. \u201cWhen Jewish students say something is hurtful or problematic, they\u2019re told, \u2018You\u2019re crazy,\u2019 \u2018territorial,\u2019 called \u2018racist,\u2019 \u2018Islamophobic,\u2019 \u201d said Rabbi Daniel Levine of Hillel in Orange County. \u201cIt\u2019s not just here. This is part of a much wider trend.\u201d Turns out that Levine\u2019s contract to teach History 18A \u2014 Jewish Texts \u2014 as a lecturer was not renewed at UCI in late May. The university says that\u2019s because it has hired two new, full-time, tenure-track faculty members to beef up offerings in Jewish studies \u2014 a very good thing. But dozens of students who adore Levine say it\u2019s a cave-in to demands for an \u201cacademic boycott\u201d of Israel and the scrubbing of \u201cZionist programming\u201d from campus life. Those two new faculty members have expressed public dismay over Israel\u2019s conduct in the war with Hamas, they say, as have professors in the position to weigh in on Levine\u2019s contract renewal. \u201c(T)he History Department, which oversees Jewish Studies, has become a toxic and hostile environment for Jewish students,\u201d says the students\u2019 protest letter to UCI\u2019s Humanities Department. \u201c(W)e urge the university to transfer the Jewish Studies discipline to a different department outside of Humanities.\u201d The students are ardent, sincere in their passions and organized. They sing Levine\u2019s praises to the heavens, saying they\u2019ve never had a better professor, that he helped them better understand themselves and their culture, that his knowledge of the subject material is impeccable. \u201c(N)ot a single question was asked in the class that he did not know the answer to,\u201d one wrote. \u201cHistory 18A with Daniel Levine played such an important role in my educational experience at UCI and I think it would be a shame for future students not to be able to take it.\u201d From the students\u2019 perspective, and Levine\u2019s as well, ideological bias certainly played a role in all this. They suspect decisions on Levine\u2019s contract were made before the new Ph.D. hires accepted their positions, and that UCI professors who would have supported Levine were frozen out of the discussion. It\u2019s worth noting that Levine is still slated to teach medieval Jewish thought in UCI\u2019s School of Social Sciences next year. He lectures at Cal State Fullerton and Cal State Long Beach as well. It\u2019s also worth noting that a \u201cWanted\u201d poster of a political science/Jewish studies professor, complete with picture, was posted online Thursday. The professor\u2019s \u201ccrimes\u201d included \u201ccomplicity in genocide,\u201d \u201cmisinformation,\u201d \u201creceiving grants from US DOD & US Military Academy,\u201d and \u201cactively funding Israeli genocide and colonial settlement in the West Bank and Gazan Strip.\u201d A \u201ccash reward\u201d was listed, and the background print said, \u201cDivest Our Tuition Fees.\u201d It set off a firestorm. \u201cI find the wanted poster aesthetic really distasteful, since wanted posters historically were a call to action to apprehend and sometimes kill the person,\u201d one commenter on UCI Reddit said. \u201cUtterly vile,\u201d said another. Others defended the poster. \u201cScrolling through his (the professor\u2019s) liked tweets, it is evident he praises the IDF, has ZERO mentions of the atrocities being committed towards the Palestinian people, and only ever mentions the \u2018war\u2019 when it\u2019s Israelis being in danger,\u201d a commenter said. \u201cSo yeah.. he\u2019s a Zionist freak and this poster not only isn\u2019t antisemitic, it\u2019s also truthful. Cry about it.\u201d \u2018Violent threats\u2019 Tensions have grown so fraught that UCI\u2019s original announcement touting the two new Jewish studies hires was edited to remove their names \u2014 and Levine\u2019s name as well. There\u2019s no dark conspiracy here, the university said. Levine did a great job. He\u2019s a well-respected lecturer. Students love him. UCI is \u201cfully committed\u201d to supporting Jewish studies, and the two new tenure-track positions prove it, representing a \u201cmajor expansion\u201d of the program. It\u2019s as simple as this, officials said: With two new full-time Ph.D.\u2019s soon on board, there\u2019s simply no need for a part-time contract lecturer to teach History 18A/Jewish Texts. \u201cUC Irvine\u2019s Department of History has become the object of a pressure campaign,\u201d said a missive on the flap posted June 5 by Tyrus Miller, dean of the School of Humanities. \u201cA flood of messages, mostly automatically generated or copied, but a few individually crafted as violent personal threats, degrading insults and calls for punishment, have been received by the department, the school and the campus leadership. There has also been a series of slanderous online conversations that either omit or misrepresent key factual details. \u201cAll of these messages contain a significant amount of misinformation, whether deliberately or because of lack of familiarity with processes the university uses for hiring faculty and establishing curricula. Those who choose to amplify false and erroneous information deliberately will no doubt continue to do so; but as the leader responsible for the programs of the School of Humanities, including the History Department, the Center for Jewish Studies and the minor in Jewish Studies, I cannot leave such falsehoods unchallenged.\u201d Now, about that particular course. The history department has offered it regularly, but not constantly, since 2007. Over the past 17 years, it has been taught just 10 times, by five different faculty members and lecturers. This isn\u2019t the first time a lecturer\u2019s contract has not been renewed. And while the class isn\u2019t slated to be offered in the fall, that\u2019s nothing exceptional: it will be offered in either the winter or spring quarter next year, officials said. And it will be taught by faculty. As the faculty union\u2019s contract specifies, faculty have priority over part-timer lecturers for course assignments. Also worth noting: The hiring process for new faculty is never in any one professor\u2019s hands. It takes months and there\u2019s a rather elaborate protocol, as per UC. This one included \u201ca rigorous international search\u201d and an independent committee appointed by the dean to review applications, conduct interviews, agree on four candidates for on-campus interviews and recommend two finalists. The entire faculty in both history and comparative literature approved the recommendations. Connecting the trauma of the recent protests with the staffing of History 18A/Jewish Texts is just incorrect, officials said. They\u2019re hoping the Jewish studies minor gets more popular now that it will be more fully staffed; only four students have the minor right now, and only one student graduated with the minor in the past four years. Dean Miller, for his part, sounds mighty angry. \u201c(W)e have been slandered and slurred,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have received degrading, threatening messages of hate and misogyny. We have had to hear the qualifications of our new faculty questioned and have received baseless messages, shared with the leadership of the campus up to the Chancellor and the UC Regents, claiming that our newly hired Senate faculty received their positions not because of their scholarly merit and accomplishment but because of their political views. \u201cThis is unacceptable and deeply reprehensible. I decry this attempt to negatively influence and derail the academic mission of the university.\u201d Unconvinced The students aren\u2019t satisfied with the university\u2019s response. Rather than addressing whether individual beliefs were misused in the hiring process, the focus has been on how threatened officials felt by a few emails. Levine\u2019s class \u201chas been one of the most intellectually engaging experiences I have had at UCI,\u201d said student Sami Ilan by email. \u201cThe nonrenewal of his contract pulls back the curtain on a wider systemic issue at UCI and beyond, where the needs and fears of Jewish students are not only ignored but conflated with conspiratorial thinking.\u201d UCI\u2019s two new hires \u201cdemonstrate that personal beliefs can take precedence over honesty and academic integrity, which is a complete violation of academia,\u201d Ilan continued. \u201cIndividuals not directly affiliated with an age-old conflict believe they possess complete understanding and feel justified in violating academic principles to impose a one-sided view on their students. It is disappointing because a teacher is supposed to open the doors to learning, allowing students to choose their path.\u201d Ilan and other students call for Levine\u2019s reinstatement. Levine sees a problem with the humanities writ large \u2014 \u201cthe reduction of nuanced thinking, of activism parading as academia,\u201d he said. We should be suspicious of black/white thinking, of those who purport to have all the answers. There are no clear answers. \u201cThere is a tension of values here,\u201d he said. \u201cA real tension that can\u2019t be reduced to \u2018We need to kill all Hamas\u2019 or \u2018Israel just wants to kill babies.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, in the UCI Reddit where the \u201cWanted\u201d poster set off a firestorm, there was great debate. Was it really from a student? Or was it a false flag planted to discredit the other side and create the appearance of enemies where none exist? \u201cIgnore the ragebait folks,\u201d one commenter urged. If only. If only we could.", "summary": "Columnist Teri Sforza writes that a lecturer's contract was not renewed, leading to complaints that he was replaced because the university caved to demands for an 'academic boycott' of Israel.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/09/toxic-and-hostile-environment-for-jewish-students-at-uc-irvine-students-claim/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/OCR-L-UCIDAY3-0502-09-PB.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:42", "author": "Teri Sforza", "authors": ["Teri Sforza"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.088}

{"id": 239761222, "title": "UK weather: Heat-health alerts as temperatures to near heatwave", "text": "The next few days are expected to bring the highest temperatures of the summer so far as warm air surges northwards across the UK. Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to see their warmest weather on Monday, with highs of 24 to 26C, before cloudier and cooler weather arrives from the west on Tuesday. But in England and Wales the heat is expected to be longer-lasting, with midweek temperatures of 28 or 29C likely in the South East - accompanied by plenty of strong sunshine. It is possible that some areas might reach the Met Office\u2019s official heatwave criteria. The nights will also be warmer and more humid than we have been used to lately. The weather is expected to turn cooler and wetter by the end of the week but there is considerable uncertainty about how quickly that change will take place. If you are making plans further ahead, including for Glastonbury, it is worth staying up-to-date with BBC Weather over the coming days.", "summary": "A yellow heat-health alert will be issued for most of England from 08:00 BST on Monday.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrrjm496gpo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/05d2/live/98539b60-30d8-11ef-90be-b75b34b0bbb2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:30:09", "author": "Ben Rich", "authors": ["Ben Rich"], "language": "en", "catgory": "environment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.192}

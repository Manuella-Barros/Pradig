[+] World Cup Qatar 2022 Group E match between Costa Rica and Germany at Al Bayt Stadium on December 01, 2022 in Al Khor, Qatar. (Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images) Getty Images Even judged by the surreal methodology by which FC Barcelona has operated over the past decade the firing of Xavi was bizarre. In January, the legendary manager turned coach revealed he was leaving at the end of the season following a rotten run of results. \"I think the club needs a change of dynamic,\" Xavi said at the time, \"for the good of the players, I believe that they will free themselves. We play with a lot of tension. It appeared that his announcement did precisely that because almost as soon as he\u2019d told the world of his desire to be rid of the position where he felt he was \u201cnot valued\u201d and \u201cmistreated\u201d results improved. The upturn so impressed the club\u2019s leadership that by April Xavi was hugging President Joan Laporta at a press conference announcing a reversal of the decision. \"We know that he made some statements in the middle of the season, but today we have the good news that he is staying and he has conveyed to me the enthusiasm and confidence he has in the project,\u201d Laporta gushed at the time. It was a strange turn of events given that FC Barcelona still trailed Real Madrid by 11 points and had been dumped from the Champions League at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain. The love-in lasted barely a month, as the Catalan giants continued to limp to the finish line the hierarchy decided they didn\u2019t want Xavi in charge anymore. However, the words of the outgoing coach were rather formal and cryptic when asked about his axing. \"I spoke with the president and he transmitted to me his reasons for considering the need for a change,\" said Xavi.

He's the one who makes the decisions at the club. We shook hands, hugged and wished each other the best. I will be another fan in the stands now. \"The decision was made thinking of the club's [best interests] because they believe a change of direction is needed. \"I have remained motivated, hungry and ambitious until now. I believe in the squad, that we could do big things with small changes, but it was not to be.\" Although he was prone to the odd touchline hysterics and famously told the media \u201cWho's the fool now?\u201d After Barcelona defeated Napoli in the Champions League Round of 16, one of Xavi\u2019s problems was he never seemed to be able to master the intense pressure of the role. The constant noise around the club, known as \u2018entorno\u2019, has taken its toll on characters far sturdier and more experienced than Xavi, like Louis Van Gaal or Pep Guardiola. So it is incredibly strange that FC Barcelona would identify a man who is almost the antithesis of the tough-edged coach to replace him: Hansi Flick. The Accidental Leader LISBON, PORTUGAL - AUGUST 23: Hans-Dieter Flick, Head Coach of FC Bayern Munich lifts the UEFA ... [+] Champions League Trophy following his team's victory in the UEFA Champions League Final match between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich at Estadio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica on August 23, 2020 in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Michael Regan - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images) UEFA via Getty Images Although he arrives in Catalonia as a Champions League winner who has collected every available trophy available to a German manager Flick is something of an accidental hero. He made his name as an assistant manager to Germany national coach Joachim L\u00f6w during the nation's most successful modern period. His elevation to head coach was a result of Bayern Munich firing Nico Kova\u010d midseason and putting Flick, who\u2019d be drafted in as his number two, in the top job. Winning the treble for the second time in the club\u2019s history that year established him as a top manager in his own right, although that would be called into question by what happened next. With Bayern on course for another league title and unfortunate to have exited the Champions League at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain Flick inexplicably announced he had asked the club to terminate his contract. The statement irked the Bavarian giants which said it \u201cdisapproves of the unilateral communications issued by Hansi Flick\u201d but ultimately agreed with the decision for him to depart. Following the departure he returned to the Germany national team this time as the manager where he oversaw a disastrous 2022 World Cup campaign exit at the group stage. Barcelona appears to have done what most people do in soccer, viewed a person\u2019s results whilst removing all of the contextual information that surrounds them. They\u2019ve looked at Flick\u2019s medals but not into what made them possible. The blunt truth is Flick\u2019s success as a manager can be boiled down to a brilliant two-thirds of a season with Bayern Munich where he replaced a manager who\u2019d lost the faith of both players and fans with a rather cold negative approach. As an Athletic analysis of the treble-winning campaign explained: \u201cFlick doesn\u2019t do big, memorable speeches, either in the dressing room or in front of the media. \u201cThose who have watched him closely over the last few months will tell you he has succeeded by simply being himself, a genuine man who treats everybody with respect and understands what a team of Bayern\u2019s qualities needs to thrive: simple, clear instructions and a basic set-up that brings out their best.\u201d With the best will in the world that is simply not going to be enough in the madhouse that is FC Barcelona, the entorno takes no prisoners, silence is filled with hysterical speculation and even the most genuine actions are twisted into a sinister plot. I would love to be wrong and see the good guy be the answer to all the self-inflicted maladies that blight the Catalan giants. But I just can\u2019t see it. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

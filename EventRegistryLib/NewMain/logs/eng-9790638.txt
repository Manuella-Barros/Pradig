Today marks a special milestone as Kajol, one of Bollywood's most cherished actresses, celebrates her 50th birthday. Born on August 5, 1974, Kajol has carved a niche for herself in the Indian film industry with her incredible acting prowess and captivating screen presence. Her career, spanning over three decades, is marked by a series of memorable performances that have left an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences worldwide. Kajol Birthday: 7 Iconic Performances of The Stunning Actress That Have a Long Way To Go.\n\nShe has seamlessly transitioned through various phases of her career, continuously reinventing herself and taking on diverse roles that challenge her acting abilities. Her ability to portray a wide range of emotions with authenticity has endeared her to fans of all ages. On her birthday today, here's looking at some of her best films that became timeless classics. Kajol Birthday: Picking 7 Best Pieces from Her Perennially Chic Wardrobe (View Pics).\n\nKajol's portrayal of Simran in this iconic romantic drama is legendary. Her chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan set a new benchmark for Bollywood romances, and the film continues to be celebrated for its heartwarming story and unforgettable music.\n\nIn Karan Johar's directorial debut Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kajol played the role of Anjali, where audiences saw her transform from a tomboyish college student to a graceful woman. In a new interview with Rajeev Masand's Netflix Actors' Roundtable, however, Kajol shared that she initially wanted to play Rani Mukerji's role in the film. She was quoted as saying, \"I fought in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. I fought with Karan Johar, I wanted to play Tina's role and he was like, 'No. You are playing Anjali.' I was like, 'But I want to play Tina's role. You don't know what I will do with Tina.' Karan told me to shut up.\"\n\nIn this family drama, Kajol played the vibrant and affectionate character of Anjali from Chandni Chowk, a lively and spirited woman who brings warmth and humour to the film. Her chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan, who played the role of Rahul Raichand, was one of the highlights of the movie. The duo's on-screen rapport was electric, adding depth and authenticity to their characters' love story.\n\nKajol's portrayal of Zooni, a Kashmiri blind woman who falls in love with a terrorist, showcased her versatility as an actress. Her performance was both poignant and compelling, making Fanaa a standout film in her career.\n\nTeaming up with Shah Rukh Khan again, Kajol delivered a powerful performance as Mandira, a woman who faces significant challenges due to racial prejudice. The film was acclaimed for its sensitive handling of delicate issues, with Kajol's role earning widespread praise.\n\nAs Kajol celebrates her birthday today, we look back at her remarkable contributions to Indian cinema. Her films have not only entertained but also inspired millions. Here's wishing Kajol a very happy birthday and continued success in all her future endeavours.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Johar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karan Johar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajeev_Masand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajeev Masand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simran_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simran (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rani_Mukerji", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rani Mukerji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandni_Chowk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chandni Chowk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kajol-Movie-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Cupid, in her book, didn't follow a calendar.\n\nSimilarly, 23-year-old Nutan had got married to Rajnish Bahl in 1959, the very same year as her landmark triumphs, Anari and Sujata.\n\nContinuing to defy conventional Bollywood groupthink, Kajol went on to star in major successes (Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Fanaa) even after marriage and motherhood.\n\nThis too harks back to her maasi Nutan whose career had flourished (Bandini, Milan) even after the birth of her son, Mohnish Bahl.\n\nAunt and niece both hold a record-breaking five Filmfare Best Actress Awards.\n\nIMAGE: Kajol with her mother Tanuja and grandmother Shobhana Samarth. Photograph: Kind courtesy Film History Pics/Twitter\n\nCinema is in Kajol's very bloodstream.\n\nShe is a worthy successor to her mother Tanuja, aunt Nutan and grandmother Shobhana Samarth's acting legacy.\n\nHer father, director Shomu Mukherjee, also belonged to an illustrious film family going back to patriarch S Mukherjee of Filmalaya studios.\n\nJoy Mukherji is Kajol's uncle while Ashok Kumar and Kishore Kumar are her granduncles.\n\nThe mischievous sparkle in her eyes is inherited from her mother Tanuja known for her livewire roles.\n\nA naughty, boisterous child, Kajol was the ringleader among her group of kids, which included sister Tanisha and cousin Rani Mukerji.\n\nKajol's definitive personality trait has always been her confidence.\n\n'I'm not nervous of talking to anybody,' she had said.\n\nThis helped the harum-scarum 16 year old with thick eyebrows and an undeveloped fashion sense land her debut film, Bekhudi (1992) which flopped.\n\nIMAGE: Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in Baazigar.\n\nThe success of her second film Baazigar (1993) made Kajol a star though she was nether breathtakingly beautiful nor a sensational dancer.\n\nAs Karan Johar once said, 'Her face dances more than she does but that is itself a pleasure to watch.'\n\nWhat Kajol had in her corner was undeniable talent and a felicity for expression. She did not just act out her scenes and deliver her lines in Baazigar; she inhabited her character.\n\nKajol subscribed to none of the behavioural clich\u00e9s heroines are famous for.\n\nShe hated scratchy wigs and didn't care for elaborate dressing up (paradoxically, she loved reading gothic romances) and claimed to detest having her eyebrows threaded.\n\nHere was an anomaly in glamour-obsessed Bollywood. But the movie camera loved her, as did the audience.\n\nIMAGE: Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge.\n\nLike her character in Yeh Dillagi (1994), Kajol's screen persona also underwent a dramatic makeover and the rough edges were smoothened out, courtesy Karan Johar, Manish Malhotra and Mickey Contractor.\n\nBut Kajol became a sensation not because of her designer outfits; but for her extraordinary ability to communicate with the audience.\n\nShe could expunge all signs of her natural vivacity and convey emotional vulnerability through her expressive eyes as in Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (1995) in which she famously pleads with her domineering father 'Kya aap meri khushi ke liye meri apni zindagi se mujhe ek mahina bhi nahin de sakte hai?'\n\nDDLJ is the longest-running film (28 years) in Bollywood history and it consolidated the Kajol-Shah Rukh pairing as the most popular in recent times.\n\nWhile Baazigar and Karan Arjun saw their passion short-circuited by a desire for revenge, Shah Rukh and Kajol worked best in sunnier, brightly-lit romances like their other youth epic Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998) in which they again played soulmates perennially circling around each other.\n\nIMAGE: Kajol, Bobby Deol and Manisha Koirala in Gupt.\n\nTo her credit, Kajol accomplished top-level stardom, not by being a meek trend follower but by being staunchly individualistic.\n\nThough she adamantly steered clear of art cinema, she was the first to dare to put the grrr in girl playing a murderess in Gupt (1997).\n\nAnd she gave an insight into a traumatised woman who has been unable to prevent the rape and murder of her twin sister in Dushman.\n\nKajol did take artistic risks.\n\nIn Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, when an inadvertently drunk Kajol wakes up to find herself in Shah Rukh's bed, she bursts into hysterical sobs whereas in Dil Kya Kare (1999), her character has a no-strings one-night-stand with Ajay Devgn.\n\nIMAGE: Kajol and Ajay Devgn. Photograph: Kind courtesy Kajol/Instagram\n\nKajol was at the peak of her career and had just had a rare hat-trick of hits (Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain) when she decided in 1999 to get married to Ajay Devgan, whom she had been dating for five years.\n\nIt's a marriage of opposites.\n\nAjay is the strong silent type while Kajol is effervescent.\n\nYet, they successfully celebrated the silver jubilee of their marriage this February.\n\nKajol refused to hit the brakes on her career after marriage unlike the time-honoured tradition followed by Jaya Bhaduri and Mumtaz or even Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla.\n\nShe rose even further with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001) for which she won her third Best Actress Filmfare Award.\n\nIMAGE: Kajol with daughter Nysa. Photograph: Kind courtesy Kajol/Instagram\n\nThe actress did take a break after delivering a baby girl Nysa to concentrate on her upbringing.\n\nA five-year-long hiatus later, Kajol achieved something most heroines have failed at -- a post-baby comeback as the leading lady of a hit big-budget extravaganza.\n\nKajol also bagged the Best Actress award for this film ,Fanaa (2006), and proved that she was still salsa-hot.\n\nShe did films on her own terms, like Ajay Devgn's directorial debut U Me Aur Hum, another award-winning role in My Name Is Khan, as a terminally-ill mother in We Are Family and, at the age of 41, a grey-shaded role in her seventh teaming with superstar Shah Rukh: Dilwale.\n\nIMAGE: Netflix's Vice President Content Monika Shergill, Kajol, Kriti Sanon and Kanika Dhillon will get together for Do Patti. Photograph: Kind courtesy Kajol/Instagram\n\nKajol has hit 50, and in today's Hindi film world, that is the new 35.\n\nHer recent roles like Helicopter Eela and Salaam Venky were met with a lukewarm response but she has pivotal roles in as many as four films on hand: Maharagni with Prabhudeva, her home production Maa, Sarzameen with Prithviraj and Do Patti with Kriti Sanon.\n\nThese films will decide Kajol's future status within the industry.\n\nBut those who know Kajol are not too worried.\n\nIf there's one thing the full-of-beans star knows, it's how to stay happy.\n\nYearFilmLeading Man

From romantic comedies like the girl next door to intense parts, her remarkable skill never failed to capture our hearts. Kajol's father Shomu Mukherjee was a well-known director, and she is the daughter of legendary star Tanuja. She followed in her mother's footsteps and made her acting debut in Bekhudi at the age of 17. She began receiving praise from both critics and fans for the role. The action-romance did not do well at the movie office, even with favourable reviews. Here's a look back at the moment Kajol revealed she didn't want to perform at all, in honour of her 50th birthday. Yes, you read that right!\n\nKajol appeared on the Saavn podcast back in 2018, during which she stated that she didn't want to be an actor to Rajeev Masand and Anupama Chopra. \"I never wanted to be an actor actually. I didn't think of it was worth the money that was being paid out. I didn't think it was worth the effort and I definitely thought my worked too hard for whatever she was doing and however we were at that point of time (as quoted by NDTV).\" But Tanuja, her mother, was determined that her daughter begin working and get a paycheck at the end of each month.\n\nKajol's career reached new heights when she was cast in Abbas Mastan's criminal film Baazigar in 1993 crime-thriller. The movie, which also starred Shah Rukh Khan and Shilpa Shetty, was a hit, and Kajol's performance won several accolades. After that, there was no turning back as Kajol starred in several high-profile movies, including Karan Arjun, Gupt, Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya, Dushman, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Raju Chacha, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and many more.\n\nShe won the 1995 Filmfare Award for Best Actress for her role in the romantic drama Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ), directed by Yash Chopra. In recognition of her enormous contribution to Indian film, Kajol received the esteemed Padma Shri Award in 2011, which is the fourth-highest civilian honour. The public loved her on-screen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nThe mother of two, Kajol, took a little hiatus from acting following the release of the 2015 movie Dilwale. However, in 2017, she returned to the big screen in the Tamil film Velaiilla Pattadhari 2, which starred Dhanush as well.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shomu_Mukherjee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shomu Mukherjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_next_door", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Girl next door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajeev_Masand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajeev Masand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anupama_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anupama Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmfare Award for Best Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhanush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhanush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yash Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Shri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Padma Shri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shilpa Shetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tamil cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kajol-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The actress has been a part of the industry for the last three decades but has walked with time and came up with performances that evoked emotions in each decade. She has made a special place in the hearts of the audience with her amazing acting and bubbly nature. Kajol has done many such films in her career which were blockbuster hits. Her pairing with Shah Rukh Khan is considered the most hit. From the girl next door to the villain's role in a romantic comedy, Kajol has done a great job. Today on August 5, Kajol is celebrating her 50th birthday. On this occasion, we are telling you the 5 best performances of the actress that became iconic.\n\nIsha Diwan in Gupt: The Hidden Truth (1997)\n\nThis mystery thriller film had Bobby Deol and Manisha Koirala in the lead roles. Gupt is known for its tremendous suspense and Kajol's excellent acting. She played a negative role in the film. She also won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role.\n\nNaina and Sonia in Dushman (1998)\n\nKajol played a double role for the first time as Naina and Sonia. Ashutosh Rana played the villain in the film. This was a revenge film in which Kajol takes revenge for the rape and murder of her twin sister.\n\nAnjali in Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (2001)\n\nKajol once again won everyone's hearts by becoming Anjali along with SRK. She played the role of a bindaas girl from Delhi in the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, who was totally desi and playful. From her weird childhood behaviour to her funny Shayari dialogues, Kajol has performed brilliantly in every frame. Kajol's \"Bade Mazaakiya Ho\" dialogue from the film became quite famous.\n\nJuni in Fanaa (2006)\n\nIn 2006, Kajol played the role of a blind girl Juni in Kunal Kohli's film Fanaa. Although this film was not very successful, Kajol won everyone's hearts with this role.

Her impactful performances and versatility have helped the diva to establish a special place in the hearts of the audience.\n\nKajol as an actress needs no introduction. She made her foray into Bollywood with director Rahul Rawail's 1992 film Bekhudi. However, she attained commercial success with Baazigar, starring Shah Rukh Khan in the lead. Over the years, she has carved a niche for herself in the Hindi film industry. Her impactful performances and versatility have helped the diva to establish a special place in the hearts of the audience.\n\nApart from that, Kajol's quirks and hilarious antics, highlight her fun-loving personality which often leaves her fans in splits. As the actress turns 50 today, August 5, let's take a walk down memory lane, revisiting her journey in the world of glitz and glam as well as her top movies, web series, best songs, and family life:\n\nKajol was born on August 5, 1974. She is the daughter of veteran actress Tanuja while her father Shomu Mukherjee was a prominent filmmaker. Following her mother's footsteps, Kajol made her acting debut at the age of 17 with Bekhudi in which her performance garnered appreciation from fans and critics alike. Despite the positive reviews, the action romance failed to perform at the box office.\n\nThe following year, Kajol was roped in for Abbas Mastan's crime thriller Baazigar, which took her career to new heights. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan and Shilpa Shetty, the film was a blockbuster and Kajol's performance received much praise. There was no looking back after that, as Kajol appeared in several big-budgeted films like Yeh Dillagi, Karan Arjun, and Gundaraj among others.\n\nIn 1995 Kajol received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress for Yash Chopra's romance-drama Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ).\n\nIn 2011, Kajol was honoured with the fourth-highest civilian award -- the prestigious Padma Shri Award, for her immense contribution to Indian cinema. Her on-screen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan was a hit with the audience.\n\nThe duo appeared in films like Baazigar, DDLJ, Karan Arjun, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, My Name is Khan and Dilwale. The actress has also showcased her acting prowess in the digital world. She has appeared in noteworthy web series too.\n\nKajol met Ajay Devgn for the first time on the sets of Anees Bazmee's Hulchul in 1995. Initially, Ajay found Kajol very \"loud, arrogant, and a very talkative person\". The actor revealed the fact in an old interaction with Pioneer. \"We were very different from each other in terms of personality. But, I guess what is meant to happen, happens,\" he said.\n\nKajol, in an interview with the Humans of Bombay, revealed that when she first met her now-husband, both were dating two different people. \"I was going out with somebody, I think he was going out with somebody at that point in time. We just started talking, became friends, then eventually I broke up, he broke up and then we became a little more than friends,\" she disclosed.\n\nEventually, the two became good friends and began dating while shooting for the 1995 film Gundaraj. After dating for 4 years, the couple tied the knot on February 24, 1999, in a lavish Maharashtrian-style wedding. Kajol and Ajay Devgn welcomed their first child, daughter Nysa in 2003 and became proud parents to son Yug in September 2010.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Rawail", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Rawail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shomu_Mukherjee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shomu Mukherjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmfare_Award_for_Best_Actress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmfare Award for Best Actress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yash_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yash Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shilpa Shetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Devgn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Devgn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anees_Bazmee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anees Bazmee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Shri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Padma Shri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/kajol-birthday-2024-08-ed508cdaccd9904de64b47b902041f3c-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 797, "textEnd": 805}, {"amb": false, "date": "1999-02-24", "textStart": 3240, "textEnd": 3257}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-09-", "textStart": 3410, "textEnd": 3424}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

During the promotion of Dilwale, a DDLJ-inspired film released in 2015, Kajol pulls SRK's cheeks and says \"koochie koochie koo,\" letting out a big laugh. With the bond these two share, Kajol claims she is the only one who can do this with SRK.\n\nThe DDLJ fever never left some of us, and the lingering side effects include bursting into iconic song regularly. Kajol's enthusiastic personality is what set her apart from the crowd during her peak in Bollywood, and this throwback video she shared on Instagram of her singing 'Ho Gaya Hai Tujhko Tok Pyaar Sajna' from her movie DDLJ shows Kajol is never afraid to be herself. The caption, \"Who needs perfect pitch when you've got this much enthusiasm?\" perfectly captures the motto Kajol lives by.\n\nOn the account of World Laughter Day, Kajol posted an Instagram reel of a compilation of some videos that caught her tripping, stumbling, flipping, fumbling. These clips posted by Kajol prove that she can have a good laugh, even if she is the one everyone is laughing at.\n\nA video from a pujo pandal in 2021 showed Kajol fighting it out with her younger sister Tanisha as mom Tanuja tried to play peacemaker. The video showed the hilarious way siblings fight no matter how old they get. While it wasn't clear what they were quarrelling about, Kajol and Tanishaa were seen arguing playfully. At one point, Kajol is heard telling Tanishaa, \"Just stop, you're not getting any brownie points...\"\n\nIn an interview with BBC Asian Network, Kajol was asked to recreate and reenact her iconic dialogues from her famous 90s Bollywood movies, and she indeed did. She enacted her famous \"Gamla nahi Vase\" dialogue from Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham, and the bit was bang on. Kajol never shies away from an opportunity to show off her quirks, and her dramatics are one of the many.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanishaa_Mukerji", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanishaa Mukerji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Asian_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Asian Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/kajol_birthday_50_1722858541839_1722858542036.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

With four diverse projects in various stages of production, the actor reflects on her enduring career and the evolving landscape of Indian cinema.\n\n\"I don't do too much work. That's my motivation,\" Kajol tells Variety with characteristic frankness. \"I want to work with good people. I want to work with people that I can tolerate for the entire amount of time that I'm shooting with them.\" This selective approach has served her well over the decades, allowing her to stay relevant.\n\nKajol's career has been marked by a string of memorable performances in commercial and critical successes. Her collaborations with Shah Rukh Khan in films like \"Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,\" \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" and \"My Name is Khan\" have become cultural touchstones. She's also won acclaim for more dramatic turns in \"Fanaa\" and \"Gupt,\" while her recent forays into streaming with Netflix's \"Tribhanga\" and \"Lust Stories 2\" and Disney+ Hotstar's \"The Good Wife\" adaptation \"The Trial\" have showcased her adaptability to changing audience preferences. Her ventures into Tamil-language cinema, including \"Minsara Kanavu\" and the more recent \"Velaiilla Pattadhari 2,\" have further demonstrated her cross-cultural appeal.\n\nHer upcoming slate showcases her versatility, spanning horror, action, drama and mystery. In \"Maa,\" Kajol ventures into the horror genre for the first time. \"It scares the crap out of me and hopefully, you as well,\" she quips. However, she's quick to point out the film's complexity: \"It's more than just horror. It's a psychological drama with elements of thriller and suspense. You can't really keep it to one genre.\" Working with director Vishal Furia, known for his work in the genre, has been a positive experience. \"He's a fabulous director, and you have a great time working with him,\" she notes.\n\nKayoze Irani's \"Sarzameen,\" a mystery thriller, delves into relationships and the facets of love. \"I've worked with Prithviraj [Sukumaran] for the first time and he's absolutely wonderful to work with and so was Ibrahim [Ali Khan], so I think it's going to be quite interesting to see both of them on screen,\" Kajol says.\n\nCharan Tej Uppalapati's action-packed \"Maharagni - Queen of Queens\" reunites her with Prabhu Deva 27 years after Rajiv Menon's \"Minsaara Kanavu.\" While details are under wraps, Kajol describes it as an \"out and out commercial film\" with strong characters pitted against each other.\n\nNetflix's \"Do Patti\" sees Kajol playing a cop. \"That's a completely different character for me to play,\" Kajol says.\n\nReflecting on the current state of Indian cinema, Kajol notes the unpredictable nature of box office success. \"Right now, it's a huge question mark. There is no formula,\" she observes. \"We can't predict audiences. If we could, we'd be gods of the film industry.\"\n\nShe acknowledges the impact of global content on audience tastes. \"When you're watching content in all different languages across the world, you're bound to compare your own content to it,\" Kajol says. \"Today, you're not only going to be compared to the people within your sphere, it's a lot bigger, this pool is much bigger for you to stand out in. And therefore, you have to perform at that level as well.\"\n\nKajol remains focused on her craft. \"My hero is my script,\" she states. \"I have to really like what I'm doing, who I'm playing. I have to be able to find that amount of material to work with. A good script is not easy to find, it's really not easy to find, it's something that you have to like, look through, look through, look through.\"\n\nAs for the possibility of working in Western productions, Kajol is open but selective. \"I'd like to, but again, I feel that that's something that it's a different world altogether. I want to be able to do something that would really be worthwhile,\" she explains.\n\nKajol continues to navigate the ever-changing landscape of Indian cinema with her trademark blend of practicality and passion. Fans of her recent streaming hit \"The Trial\" may have reason for optimism, as Kajol teases the possibility of a second season, saying, \"Cross your fingers and pray.\"", "source": {"uri": "qnewshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "QNewsHub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shreya_bhatt@qnewshub.com", "name": "Shreya Bhatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+_Hotstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+ Hotstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhanga_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tribhanga (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithviraj_Sukumaran", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prithviraj Sukumaran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayoze_Irani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayoze Irani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishal_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vishal (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tamil language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Wife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Good Wife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Menon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Menon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabhu_Deva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prabhu Deva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i1.wp.com/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kajol1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

She even ignored Shah Rukh Khan's advice on learning acting techniques, only to realise later how important it is for an actor to sometimes not give their everything to a character.\n\n\"I reached a point in my career where I was doing things unconsciously. I was doing everything... I was like 'ye bhi kar do, ye dialogue bhi bol do, sab kuch andar se nikal raha tha' (Do everything, say every dialogue, everything was coming from within),\" Kajol shared during an interview with Humans of Cinema.\n\nAt the time, Shah Rukh Khan, with whom Kajol had shared the screen in films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, advised her to learn acting technique. But she didn't take him seriously.\n\n\"I remember having this conversation with Shah Rukh, and he was like, 'Maybe you have got to learn this technique of acting.' I was like, 'What's that? Aisi bhi koi cheez hai? (Is there something like that too?)' He said, 'Yes, people are taught this technique, and you have to learn this because you cannot do everything from within.' I didn't take it seriously then,\" Kajol recalled.\n\nBut then came a time when Kajol felt exhausted from her job and told her mother, actor Tanuja, that she wanted a break from \"meaningful cinema.\"\n\nKajol shared, \"I did a film called Udhar Ki Zindagi (1994). After that film, I felt I was done with the film industry and acting. I was completely burnt out as an actor and I didn't want to do movies any more. I told my mother I was taking a break from all this meaningful cinema, this rona-dhona and good roles. I didn't want to do them any more. I told her I wanted to be a typical 3-scenes and 4-songs kind of actor who doesn't have many scenes. So, I signed 3 films which had that kind of role, and they were a relief.\"\n\nHowever, during this time, Kajol also learnt the importance of learning the technique. She realised, \"You don't have to give so much of yourself to something and you can just act knowing you are good at it.\"\n\nKajol made her acting debut with the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi. Though the film was a box office failure, Kajol gained popularity. She first tasted success with the 1993 film Baazigar, co-starring Shilpa Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-office_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box-office bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shilpa Shetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/kajol-054121532-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=pCRY7ExSb8Ktt5LkhYSVPRbDe35w3Xp.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 117}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Despite advice from Shah Rukh Khan on the importance of learning acting techniques, Kajol initially dismissed the idea, only to later understand its significance.\n\nIn an interview with Humans of Cinema, Kajol revealed, \"I reached a point in my career where I was doing things unconsciously. I was doing everything... I was like 'ye bhi kar do, ye dialogue bhi bol do, sab kuch andar se nikal raha tha' (Do everything, say every dialogue, everything was coming from within).\"\n\nKajol recalled a conversation with Shah Rukh Khan, her co-star in iconic films like Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. \"Shah Rukh told me, 'Maybe you have got to learn this technique of acting.' I was like, 'What's that? Aisi bhi koi cheez hai? (Is there something like that too?)' He said, 'Yes, people are taught this technique, and you have to learn this because you cannot do everything from within.' I didn't take it seriously then.\"\n\nFeeling exhausted from her intense roles, Kajol eventually confided in her mother, veteran actor Tanuja, about needing a break from \"meaningful cinema.\" Reflecting on that period, Kajol said, \"I did a film called Udhar Ki Zindagi (1994). After that film, I felt I was done with the film industry and acting. I was completely burnt out as an actor and I didn't want to do movies anymore. I told my mother I was taking a break from all this meaningful cinema, this rona-dhona (crying) and good roles. I didn't want to do them anymore. I told her I wanted to be a typical 3-scenes and 4-songs kind of actor who doesn't have many scenes. So, I signed 3 films which had that kind of role, and they were a relief.\"\n\nDuring her period of burnout, Kajol gained a crucial understanding of the importance of acting techniques. Reflecting on her journey, she shared, \"You don't have to give so much of yourself to something; you can just act knowing you are good at it.\"\n\nKajol's acting journey began with the 1992 romantic drama Bekhudi. Although the film was a box office failure, it marked the start of her rise to fame. Her breakthrough came with the 1993 film Baazigar, co-starring Shilpa Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan, which catapulted her to stardom.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-office_bomb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box-office bomb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shilpa Shetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/kajol-shah-rukh-khan-2024-08-74487d93c0252928027807591744ea24-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

With her performances, she has wowed the audience many times. Kajol has played several roles, each with equal compassion. While everyone talks about her roles, it's her dialogue delivery that has caught our attention. On Kajol's birthday, here's a look at some of her famous dialogues which have become part of our everyday conversations.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Kuch kuch hota hai Rahul, tum nahi samjhoge\" - Anjali, 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'\n\nThis has to be one of the most loved dialogues of Kajol. Remember how Anjali fell in love with Rahul but couldn't express it? This dialogue reminds us of that hurt and pain. For millennials, this dialogue is not just some lines but an emotion.\n\n\"Rahul is a cheater. He is a cheater, he is a cheater, CHEATER\" - Anjali, 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'\n\nWhen Anjali and Rahul were playing basketball, this is exactly when he cheats to win, and taddaa Kajol unknowingly delivers a dialogue that went on to become iconic. You have to admit, every time someone cheats in a game, this dialogue is what we want to say to them.\n\n\"Aisa pehli baar hua hai satrah atrah saalon mein, andekha anjaana koi aane laga khayalon mein.\" - Simran, 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' (1995)\n\nDDLJ has to be Kajol's most loved film, and her character Simran got her immense love and recognition. The movie, which stars Kajol opposite Shah Rukh Khan, is one of her highest grossers. This dialogue is from DDLJ, and Kajol says this after she falls in love with Raj (played by Shah Rukh Khan).\n\n\"Tere dil mein meri saanson ko panah mil jaye, Tere ishq mein meri jaan fanaa ho jaye\" - Zooni, 'Fanaa'\n\nZooni was one of the innocent roles that stuck with us. This dialogue is from Kajol's film opposite Aamir Khan.\n\n\"Bade mazaki ho... Bade mazaki ho\" - Anjali, 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' (2001)\n\nK3G has been our guilty pleasure for ages now. And this dialogue has become the go-to line for expressing disbelief over something.\n\n\"Lucknow da kurta, Pathani salwar... tab lage mard, varna lage bekaar\"\n\nI think we can just pick all the dialogues from K3G because they are all iconic. It is when Rahul tries to flirt with Anjali that she says these iconic lines as he comes to eat a feast wearing a three-piece suit.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Compassion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simran_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simran (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fana_(Sufism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fana (Sufism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ishq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varna (Hinduism)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamir_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aamir Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/aug/kajol-three-july_d_d.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

In an interview with Humans of Cinema, Kajol revealed that she reached a point in her career where she was acting unconsciously. She explained that she was doing everything instinctively, delivering every dialogue and performing every action from within.\n\nKajol recalled a conversation with Shah Rukh Khan, her co-star in iconic films like 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' and 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge'.Shah Rukh had advised her to learn the technique of acting, to which she initially responded with disbelief, questioning the existence of such a technique. He emphasized that people are taught this method and that she couldn't rely solely on her instincts. However, Kajol admitted that she didn't take his advice seriously at the time.\n\nFeeling exhausted from her intense roles, Kajol eventually confided in her mother, veteran actor Tanuja, about needing a break from meaningful cinema. She reflected on that period, explaining that after doing the film 'Udhar Ki Zindagi' (1994), she felt completely burnt out and didn't want to continue acting. She told her mother that she wanted to take a break from all the meaningful, emotional roles and instead wanted to be a typical actor with only three scenes and four songs. Kajol mentioned that she signed three films with such roles, which provided her with the relief she needed.\n\nLater on, the actress admitted that she gained a crucial understanding of the importance of acting techniques. Reflecting on her journey, she shared that one doesn't have to give so much of themselves to a role; they can just act, knowing they are good at it.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

The actress debuted with the film Bekhudi.\n\nKajol has turned 50 years old today, August 5. The actress has been a part of the entertainment industry for over three decades. Even though she does fewer films today, she was one of the leading actresses in the 90s. She stunned fans when she married at the peak of her career with Ajay Devgn in 1999. However, in the early days of her career, the actress struggled to get her hands on the blockbuster films. One of the major reasons was her dark complexion and body weight.\n\nHowever, the actress never considered these taunts as obstacles and paved her way to success in Bollywood. Today, even though she does fewer films, she earns crores as a businesswoman. She owns her makeup brand along with a partnership with Ajay Devgn's production house. According to the report of Financial Express, Kajol's net worth is Rs 250 crore. She reportedly earns around Rs 25 crore annually.\n\nKajol is the daughter of late producer-director Somu Mukherjee and actress Tanuja. Kajol debuted with the film Bekhudi. She was 17 years old at the time of her debut. The actress's first film was not commercially successful at the box office. After this, the actress became the centre of criticism due to her complexion and weight.\n\nTalking to Humans of Bombay, Kajol recalled, \"She is dark, she is fat and she wears specs all the time. These were some of the judgments that were passed when I first started working in the industry. I couldn't care less. I knew I was smart, cool and better than everyone out there who had any negatives to say about me. So, I kept continuing to be myself and never let it show. Sooner or later, when they couldn't pull me down, the world simply embraced me for who I was- Kajol.\"\n\nThe actress's second film was Baazigar. It was directed by Abbas-Mastan, and starred Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Shilpa Shetty in the lead roles. Following the success of the film, the actress became a star overnight. The producers of big banners started approaching the actress for the films. The actress is known for films like Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kiya, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Dil Kya Kare, Hum Aapke Dil Me Rehte Hah, Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham and others.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajay_Devgn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ajay Devgn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuja", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tanuja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Financial_Express_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Financial Express (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Rukh_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shah Rukh Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shilpa Shetty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/08/img-2-2024-08-05t122454.711-2024-08-af1d995ea001ea403325144b289aab4a-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 172}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

From Devi to Salaam Venky, a look at the birthday girl's increasingly experimental filmography", "body": "The more recent years of her career however, have seen her make a marked shift from typical commercial projects to more nuanced scripts, which tend to be packing some impactful social messaging. In honour of her birthday then, let's round up the best of the lot during the second innings of her career.\n\nSpanning all of 13 minutes, Kajol's first and only short film, Devi, released back in March 2020 and made quite the waves with its innovative storytelling and plot twist. Directed by debutante Priyanka Bannerjee, the primary theme of the film was how women from different stratas of life, stand united by one common experience -- their abuse. Created to reflect a purgatory of sorts for women who have been victims of rape, the short film also stars names like Shruti Haasan and Neha Dhupia. The last snippet of the short feature is bound to leave you jarred.\n\nThe very next year, Kajol took her tryst with women-centric cinema a step further with digital release Tribhanga: Tedhi Medhi Crazy (2021). Written and directed by Renukan Shahane, the film largely flew under the radar. That being said, it still makes for one of Kajol's more nuanced picks, presenting the story of three generations of women plagued by their past and grappling with their present. Tribhanga makes for an honest take on mother-daughter relationships being necessarily flawed, not on account of them being women, but on account of them being human.\n\nRevathi's Salaam Venky (2022) may not have featured Kajol front and centre, but her role as Kolavennu Sujata Krishnan, was the driving force behind the major strides taken by Kolavennu Venkatesh Prasad Krishnan, played by Vishal Jethwa. The film follows the short but impactful life of Venky, diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The film is a heartening take on honouring one's zest for life, no matter the circumstances.\n\nArguably Kajol's most popular title in this lineup, Lust Stories 2 marked its digital release in 2023. Kajol featured in the lead for Amit Sharma's segment of the anthology film, titled Tilchatta. Kajol essayed the role of Devyani, a former prostitute, living an unpleasing life with her husband, a former king characterised by his incessant abusive tendencies towards women. The film is a skillful but heartbreaking take on Devyani attempting to weaponise her husband's lust against him, in a plan that majorly backfires. The less said the better about Tilchatta if you are yet to see it.\n\nKajol has a series of projects currently in the works, many of which she has already completed filming for. First in the lineup is Ibrahim Ali Khan's acting debut, Sarzameen, directed by Kayoze Irani. Interestingly, Ibrahim will be debuting without a leading lady and Kajol will be holding a pivotal role in this patriotic thriller set in Kashmir.\n\nKajol has also completed filming for Kriti Sanon's debut venture as producer, Do Patti. Do Patti is yet another female-centric project the actor has chosen to be a part of. Directed by Shashanka Chaturvedi, the mystery thriller is entirely set in North India and is being touted as a film which will feature Kajol and Kriti in never-before-seen roles.\n\nAs of currently, Kajol is filming for Maharagni - Queen of Queens, directed by Charan Tej Uppalapati. Kajol plays the lead role of Maya.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribhanga_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tribhanga (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shruti_Haasan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shruti Haasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neha_Dhupia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neha Dhupia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaam_Venky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salaam Venky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishal_Jethwa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vishal Jethwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devayani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devayani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujatha_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sujatha (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revathi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revathi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venkatesh_Prasad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venkatesh Prasad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Sharma_(director)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amit Sharma (director)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashanka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shashanka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayoze_Irani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kayoze Irani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leading actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthology film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/Happy_Birthday_Kajol_1722843925427_1722843925683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 400}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Take cues from Kajol Devgan and be all set to make a statement.\n\nKajol, one of Bollywood's most beloved actresses, has not only won hearts with her acting skills and different movie characters but also with her impeccable sense of style. As she embraces her 50s, Kajol continues to be a fashion icon, inspiring women with her confident and timeless looks. Her style evolution over the years is a testament to her ability to blend classic and contemporary elements, making her a style guide for women around 50.\n\nHere are five key elements of Kajol's fashion game that can serve as a guide for women embracing this elegant phase of life.\n\nKajol's style is rooted in timeless elegance. She often opts for classic pieces that never go out of style, such as well-tailored sarees, elegant kurtas, and structured blazers. For women around 50, investing in such timeless pieces can be a game-changer. A well-fitted black dress, a beautifully crafted saree, or a crisp white shirt can form the foundation of a versatile wardrobe. These pieces are not only flattering but also exude a sense of sophistication that is ageless.\n\nKajol is known for her love of bold colours and prints, which she incorporates into her wardrobe with flair. From vibrant reds and blues to subtle pastels and earthy tones, Kajol shows that age is no barrier to experimenting with colours. For women around 50, embracing colours can add vibrancy and freshness to their look. Similarly, playful prints like florals, geometric patterns, or traditional motifs can inject personality into an outfit. The key is to balance bold colors and prints with neutral tones, creating a harmonious and polished look.\n\nComfort is a crucial aspect of Kajol's fashion choices. She frequently opts for outfits that are stylish yet comfortable, whether it's a breezy maxi dress, a flowing saree, or a relaxed pantsuit. As women age, comfort becomes increasingly important, but it doesn't mean compromising on style. Investing in well-made, comfortable clothing that fits well can make a significant difference. Look for fabrics that breathe and move with you, such as cotton, linen, or silk blends, and opt for cuts that flatter your body shape without being restrictive.\n\nKajol's approach to accessories is thoughtful and purposeful. She knows how to make a statement with minimal effort, often opting for standout pieces like bold earrings, statement necklaces, or a classic handbag. For women around 50, accessories can be a powerful tool to elevate a look. A pair of statement earrings or a chic scarf can transform a simple outfit into something special. However, the key is to strike a balance and not over-accessorize. Choose one or two pieces that complement your outfit and reflect your personality.\n\nPerhaps the most significant element of Kajol's fashion game is her confidence. She carries herself with grace and poise, which enhances whatever she wears. Not only for women in their 50s but just for anybody, confidence is key to looking and feeling fabulous. Embrace your style, know what works for you, and wear it with pride. Confidence can make even the simplest outfit look stunning. It's about owning your choices and wearing your clothes rather than letting them wear you.\n\nKajol's fashion sense offers valuable lessons for women around 50, that style is not about following trends but about embracing what makes you feel good. By focusing on timeless elegance, playing with colors, prioritizing comfort, accessorising thoughtfully, and exuding confidence, women can create a personal style that is as unique and beautiful as they are. Just like Kajol, they can continue to inspire and turn heads at any age.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kajol", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kajol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sari"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindi cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blazer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motif (visual arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pattern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pantsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Necklace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scarf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clothing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/MixCollage-05-Aug-2024-02-05-PM-1918.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790638", "eventUri": "eng-9790638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

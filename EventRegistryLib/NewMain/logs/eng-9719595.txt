Records say otherwise | WITF", "body": "FILE - David McCormick, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, speaks during a campaign stop in Lititz, Pa., on May 13, 2022. Donald Trump's attacks on McCormick contributed to his defeat in a Republican primary earlier this year for a critical U.S. Senate seat in Pennsylvania. As he eyes another run, the former president's derision may not be such a liability. McCormick is considering a challenge to three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey.\n\nDavid McMcormick, the Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate seat, touts himself as a job creator, ready to bring his business acumen to serve Pennsylvanians. He told Fox News he \"created hundreds of jobs\" and his X account boasts he is a \"PA job creator.\"\n\nHowever, McCormick's tenure as the head of a FreeMarkets -- a Pittsburgh-based business-to-business software company -- has come under scrutiny, and the claim that he created \"hundreds of jobs\" in Pittsburgh appears unsupported by evidence.\n\nMcCormick joined the online auction and sourcing company as a vice president in December 1999, when the company employed 375 people.\n\nBy the time McCormick became president in October 2002, the company had 1,068 employees.

Now, the entire day-to-day operation of the company is more my concern.\"\n\nDuring McCormick's term as CEO, FreeMarkets lost millions of dollars in revenue, operated at a loss and sold off assets in addition to laying off employees. In SEC filings, the company cited its \"transition to a new business model\" and a \"weak\" economy for the downturn. The losses primarily came from its flagship product FullSource, an online sourcing software.\n\nPossibly as a result, McCormick started pursuing a merger with a West Coast competitor, which resulted in more local job losses.\n\nIn June 2003, McCormick initiated discussions with Robert Calderoni, chairman and CEO of Ariba, a Palo Alto-based FreeMarkets competitor, about the possibility of a \"strategic relationship of some form\" and potentially a \"business combination.\" After more discussions, McCormick approached his board about the idea in September.\n\nFrom the beginning, the company made clear its intent was to save money by reducing \"redundancies,\" including those resulting from duplicative jobs. According to SEC filings, FreeMarkets told its shareholders that a benefit of the merger would lead to \"at least $25 million in annual potential cost savings, through the consolidation of redundant facilities, personnel and overhead.\" Jim Frankola, chief financial officer for Ariba at the time, told analysts on a January 2004 conference call, \"Of those savings, we anticipate approximately one-third to come from duplicative G&A functions, plus the one-half from redundant R&D efforts, and the remainder from other functions.\"\n\nLater that month, Michael Schmitt, Ariba's executive vice president and chief marketing officer, told San Jose Mercury News that FreeMarkets would consolidate its headquarters into Ariba's, with the companies trying to \"eliminate redundant jobs.\" That same day, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted an analyst saying it was likely \"a lot of people in Pittsburgh will lose their jobs,\" adding \"that's certainly what typically happens\" with a merger.\n\nMcCormick told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \"There will certainly be redundant functions and consolidation of those functions.\" In a July 2004 deposition regarding the merger, he told the court that job losses were expected \"particularly in our technology development organization where our plan as part of the merged company is to eliminate that completely.\" The next month, McCormick told Ariba shareholders what they \"accomplished\" leading up to the merger: \"We have already eliminated 150 positions and have plans to eliminate another 100 positions over the next two quarters.\"\n\nIndeed, by the time the merger was complete, in July 2004, FreeMarkets had laid off or eliminated 150 positions. By December 2005, the combined company had reduced its workforce by an additional 100 employees, for a grand total of 250 lost jobs. At least 100 of those jobs were in Pittsburgh.\n\nCalderoni defended McCormick in an interview with the New York Post, saying, \"When we bought FreeMarkets, Dave insisted on keeping jobs in Pittsburgh. It really mattered to him as part of the transaction. In fact, he pushed for us to move jobs from California to Pittsburgh.\"\n\nIt was a difficult time to run a startup tech company. The early aughts saw the bursting of a tech bubble that had grown during the late 1990s thanks to easy access to capital but started to pop in the early 2000s. As the Pittsburgh Gazette reported, the merger married \"two unprofitable online business-to-business software and service firms that made names for themselves at the height of the dot-com boom, only to see their fortunes turn sour with the industry, forcing them to struggle to grow.\"\n\nMcCormick wrote in his book that \"creative destruction along with the bursting of the tech bubble eventually found its way to our sector as well.\" However, he also admitted, \"We didn't move fast enough to become one of the true 'software as a service' companies that would eventually dominate the landscape. As CEO, I hadn't built a team around me capable of evolving our business model quickly enough,\" leading to the decision to merge with Ariba.\n\nThe merger, however, profited McCormick quite well. He became president of Ariba and a member of its board of directors, drawing $500,000 in annual salary, compared to the $350,000 he made at FreeMarkets, and was eligible for an annual bonus targeted at $300,000. He was also awarded 83,333 shares in Ariba, valued at $921,663, and 500,000 shares of stock options that had a potential realizable value between $3.4 million and $8.8 million. In September 2005, McCormick resigned as president of Ariba to work in the George H.W. Bush administration and received another $1,701,699 in severance.\n\nMcCormick spokesperson Elizabeth Gregory told WHYY News in a statement, \"Dave is proud to have helped create hundreds of jobs in Western Pennsylvania during his time at FreeMarkets.\"", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff",

I don't owe Mitch McConnell anything,\" McCormick said.\n\n\"I am my own person fighting for the future of Pennsylvania... if they vote to put me into office.\"\n\nIn contrast, McCormick noted that his Democratic opponent Sen.

The breakdown will run in alphabetical order with at least two players each day between June 14 and July 25. Contract data courtesy spotrac.com.\n\nThe past: McCormick made 57 consecutive starts at FCS power South Dakota State. In his four full seasons as a starter, the Jackrabbits went 48-7. McCormick was a first-team AP FCS All America selection each of the past two seasons, during which South Dakota State won the national championship each year. McCormick spent six seasons at the school, playing in three games as a redshirt in 2018 and making two late-season starts in 2019 before moving into a full-time role the next season (which was played in the spring of 2021). McCormick played almost exclusively left guard in college aside from early in his career when he had sporadic snaps at right guard and center. He was a three-year college captain.\n\nPro Football Focus graded McCormick as the second-best guard in college football in 2023 (FCS and FBS combined), giving him the best grade of anyone for run blocking. PFF charged McCormick with allowing three sacks over 1,605 career college passblocking snaps.\n\n2024 outlook: Projected as a consensus mid-round pick headed into this draft, the 6-foot-4, 309-pound McCormick impressed scouts with a tough demeanor. He tested well at the combine: his 1.71-seconds split for the first 10 yards of his 40-yard dash, for example, was bested by just five of the more than four dozen offensive linemen who ran it. (Incidentally, he was tied with Steelers' first-round tackle Troy Fautanu). Only three o-linemen had a better vertical jump (35.5 inches) or 20-yard shuttle time (4.45 seconds) and none had a better broad jump (9 feet, 9 inches).\n\nTaken in the fourth round, McCormick was taking second-team reps at guard during organized team activities and minicamp. With entrenched (and well-paid) veterans James Daniels and Isaac Seumalo starters at guard, McCormick has no path to start as a rookie. But Daniels is on record that he expects to test free agency this coming spring, and the Steelers are hopeful McCormick can be his replacement.\n\nIt's still very early, and McCormick of course will have to prove his bona fides as a pro.

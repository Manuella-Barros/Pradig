The mutations are found on the GNE gene and impact an enzyme, also called GNE, that is involved in the synthesis of sialic acid and a process called sialylation, which is critical for brain development. The mutations were first identified in a pediatric patient with macrothrombocytopenia, also cal"}, "location": null, "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biochemistry_and_Molecular_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "wgt": 70}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 78}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Genetic_Programming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Genetic Programming", "wgt": 100}], "articleCounts": {"eng": 7}, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 449107200, "relevance": 1}

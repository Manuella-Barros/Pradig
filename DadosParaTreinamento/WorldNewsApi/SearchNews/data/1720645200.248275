According to the police officials, the deceased have been identified as Adnan Qureshi and the three injured persons are Arif Khan (29), Imran Qureshi (19) and Asif Khan (26).The arrested accused are Salman Khan (18), his brother Aman (20), Mohamed Anas Shaikh (28), Sama Sheikh (28), Sana Khan (21), Husena Shaikh (49) and Shakeel Shaikh (23). Two others, Saban Khan and Imran Khan, who are still on a run, are Salman\u2019s brothers.An officer said, \u201cSalman's sister named Saba had married Arif\u2019s elder brother Aftab a decade ago. They even have a child but as he got diagnosed with cancer and when he was at it's last stage, Saba left him and married Arif instead.\"The police said that Saba\u2019s four brothers and her father-in-law were against the marriage but as the rest of her in-laws were in favour, the two got married. \u201cThe dispute started between the two families only after their marriage two years ago. Her four brothers objected to it because Arif is a history sheeter and was even externed from the city limits,\u201d said an officer adding, \u201cHer father-in-law who was against the marriage sold Aftab's Kalyan house in anger. He kept the money to himself\u201d.And when her four brothers, Salman, Aman, Saban and Imran confronted her father-in-law two months ago, there was an altercation between them and the brothers were then assaulted by the victim\u2019s family in this case, said an investigator.At around 8pm Friday, Saba along with her brother-in-law Asif went to Salman's house in Chunabhatti to get her clothes and other belongings.Salman, who was at home, abused Asif for entering his house. He called his brother and assaulted him. \"Asif sustained injuries in the attack and went to Shatabdi hospital where he called his brothers Adnan and Imran. In the meantime, Arif came to know about the incident and then went and confronted Salman,\" said an officer.After providing medical aid, the police said that when Adnan, Imran and Asif were returning home, they saw that Salman and his brothers were assaulting Arif.\u201cThey stopped the rickshaw to save Arif after which the group of people attacked them with sharp objects,\" said an officer.The police said that Adnan died on the spot while Imran, Arif and Asif were severely injured. Imran and Arif are on a ventilator.An officer from Chunabhatti police station said, \"We were informed about the incident by the hospital authorities after which a team was sent and the six accused were subsequently arrested from the area.\"", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/one-killed-3-injured-as-2-groups-clash-over-family-dispute-in-mumbai-7-held-9380502/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/arrest_ef69e0.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:19:50", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.213}

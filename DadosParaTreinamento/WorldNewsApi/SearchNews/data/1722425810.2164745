{"id": 243215010, "title": "Why the Mets just might be trade deadline buyers after all", "text": "If the Mets stay hot, general manager David Stearns could be a surprise buyer at the MLB trade deadline. Stearns wasn\u2019t ready to commit to a buy-or-sell strategy Friday with 31 days of strategizing ahead, but he \u201csure\u201d can envision a scenario where he is adding pieces for a playoff push if nothing changes. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity,\u201d Stearns said, \u201cand we need to continue to run with it.\u201d An eye-opening 10-2 stretch entering a series against the equally sizzling Astros has opened possibilities that seemed laughable only two weeks ago, including owner Steve Cohen adding to a $340 million payroll. \u201cI think Steve has shown repeatedly that he is committed to investing the resources in the team that we need to compete,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cAnd certainly I think we\u2019ll continue to do so.\u201d As the Mets showed in climbing back to .500 for the first time since May 7, a lot can change quickly in the bunched-up National League wild-card race. The Mets could be in the driver\u2019s seat, treading water or out of contention completely by the July 30 deadline. \u201cThe truth is we still have time before we have to make decisions,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cClearly, our team performance has improved quite considerably over the last few weeks. We\u2019re playing much closer to the level of baseball and consistency of baseball that we envisioned throughout the course of the season.\u201d Stearns, as president of baseball operations for the Brewers, traded All-Star closer Josh Hader while adding other pieces to a first-place team at the deadline in 2022. Could he try to split the baby \u2014 subtract from a potential position of strength while fortifying other areas \u2014 in a contending season with the Mets? \u201cEvery situation is different, and certainly the types of decisions you are making in a situation in [small-market] Milwaukee are probably a little different than the types of decisions you are making here,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d rule out anything at this point. A lot can transpire in a relatively short amount of time during the season.\u201d Stearns joked that his self-imposed deadline for sizing up the Mets could be as late as July 30. \u201cDecision points surface at different times in different years,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cSometimes there are decision points about a potential transaction on July 15, and sometimes the decision points really don\u2019t surface until much closer to the deadline or deadline day. It\u2019s tough to predict when those will occur, but we\u2019ll certainly be prepared to make the best decisions we possibly can.\u201d Here are Stearns\u2019 other notable thoughts ahead of the deadline: 1. Pete Alonso, who has 16 home runs, 43 RBI and a .791 OPS, is wrapping up his best month of the season after a slow start. The Mets\u2019 resurgence temporarily has shelved speculation that he could be traded while making $20.5 million in the final year of his contract. \u201cPete has handled uncertainty, pressure, New York exceptionally well throughout his career. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s impacting him this year,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cI think Pete has had a good year. He\u2019s on pace for a bunch of home runs. He is hitting in the middle of our lineup. He gets pitched very carefully every night. I think he\u2019s doing what we would expect Pete Alonso to do.\u201d 2. Stearns doesn\u2019t point to moving Francisco Lindor into the leadoff spot on May 18, a roster reshuffling on May 31, beating the Phillies in London on June 9 or J.D. Martinez\u2019s walk-off home on June 13 as the single catalyst for a turnaround. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some of our better players now get hot all together at the same time,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cWhen you do that, it lengthens that lineup, it allows you to score runs in bunches \u2014 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to do.\u201d 3. One factor not lost on Stearns is the Mets\u2019 22-3 record in the last 25 games with catcher Francisco Alvarez in the lineup. He missed 51 days on the injured list during that stretch. \u201cLooking at Alvy\u2019s impact on the team is something that we all see,\u201d Stearns said. \u201cWe see it in how we\u2019ve played when he\u2019s been active and frankly how we\u2019ve played when he hasn\u2019t been active. Some of that is probably timing. Some of that is also the importance of a catcher \u2014 and how a catcher can impact the entire game \u2026 [on] both sides of the ball.\u201d", "summary": "If the Mets stay hot, general manager David Stearns could be a surprise buyer at the MLB trade deadline.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/why-the-mets-just-might-be-trade-deadline-buyers-after-all/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-1xemovsy7-1719616782358.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719602463&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:12:16", "author": "Ryan Dunleavy", "authors": ["Ryan Dunleavy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.04}

{"id": 231373540, "title": "Charlie Mitchell's heroics help seal Joe McDonagh Cup triumph as Offaly bag two titles in seven days", "text": "Just a week after the Offaly under-20s claimed All-Ireland honours, Johnny Kelly's men made it two national titles in seven days for the Faithful county as their rise back up the hurling ranks continues. Offaly went on a disastrous slide, having been relegated from the Leinster SHC in 2018 before immediately suffering another demotion to the Christy Ring Cup, hurling's third tier. Those times are a distant memory now. Goals in either half from Brian Duignan and Ois\u00edn Kelly were crucial, but it was the second-half exploits from man-of-the-match Charlie Mitchell that just about managed to hold off a valiant Laois fightback. Offaly, beaten at this stage 12 months ago in heart-breaking fashion after extra-time against Carlow, were really made to sweat coming down the home straight as Willie Maher's O'Moore side threw everything at them, but they dug deep to survive. The winners got off to a lightning start and Kelly's side were 1-3 to 0-1 to the good in no time, with Duignan, who finished with 1-4, playing like a man possessed in the early stages. The Durrow attacker excellently finished to the net in the third minute after a stray Enda Rowland puck-out was cut out by under-20 skipper Dan Bourke and the ball was in the onion sack seconds later. Laois quickly settled, though, and hit the next five points to level, with Paddy Purcell and Aidan Corby's hard running and accuracy causing the Faithful all kinds of problems at midfield. It was tit-for-tat, thereafter, as Laois got to grips on the Offaly puck-out and forced Mark Troy to go long to the O'Moore's benefit, while Purcell and Corby made hay on the scoreboard. The midfield pair finished with 0-8 from play in the opening half, while Eoghan Cahill picked up the scoring slack at the other end, with all five of his first-half points coming in the second quarter. Teen sensation Adam Screeney, having his first outing in Croke Park, found the going tough, but he did chip in with a nice first-half point and Cahill's late free sent Offaly in one to the good at the break, 1-13 to 0-15. The Faithfull opened the new half exactly as they started the game, with a goal inside 20 seconds as lively substitute Kelly, who has overcome two cruciate knee surgeries in recent seasons, found the bottom left-hand corner of the net. Mitchell was outstanding in that closing period and his side were seven points to the good by the 44th minute, 2-17 to 0-16, as Laois rued 10 second-half wides (a whopping 18 in total). The gap was still at seven by the 50th minute, 2-19 to 0-18, before Laois unloaded the cavalry with Stephen 'Picky' Maher and Ross King making an impact off the bench. Laois slowly chipped into the lead, with captain Aaron Dunphy making a huge impact as the game opened up and it looked like Maher's men had all momentum down the home straight. Dunphy levelled it up in the 67th minute, 2-20 to 0-26, with Offaly struggling for oxygen up front, but Mitchell refused to bend with four second-half points and the winners hit the last three scores to take the spoils.

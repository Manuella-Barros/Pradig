{"id": 225025796, "title": "Prince Harry's abrupt 'two words' after snubbing 'William's heart-to-heart", "text": "Prince Harry and Prince William once portrayed a united front, however, their relationship is now in bits following Harry and Meghan's decision to step down as senior working royals. Yet, it's been claimed there were attempts made to prevent the feud from escalating when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex initially struggled with their royal responsibilities. According to one book, a significant meeting between the siblings was called off as Harry dismissed it bluntly in two words, reports the Mirror. Hints of their discord first surfaced in 2019 in an interview given by the Duke of Sussex during his and Meghan's tour of South Africa, only a few months before their dramatic departure from their responsibilities. In a candid conversation with ITV's Tom Bradby, Harry admitted that he and Meghan were battling against certain Royal pressures, revealing a fluctuating state of their brotherly bond, experiencing \"good days\" and \"bad days\". This revelation in the book titled 'Courtiers: The Hidden Power Behind the Crown' suggests that following the broadcast of this explosive interview, William, who now holds the title of Prince of Wales, tried to extend an olive branch to his younger sibling. According to the author, Harry initially seemed receptive to his brother's gesture but eventually declined out of fear that the Royal staff might leak news of their scheduled reconciliation. Author Valentine Low reveals: \"The day after the documentary aired, William WhatsApped his brother to ask if he could come and see him. Initially, Harry was in favour. Then he spoke to his brother again and asked him whom he would tell. William explained that he'd have to clear his schedule, which would mean telling his private secretary. \"At that point, Harry told him: Don't come. He was so concerned that William's team would leak the visit to the press that he would rather not see his brother than risk it getting into the papers.\" The book also notes that the missed opportunity for a face-to-face meeting was seen as 'heartbreaking' by those close to both princes and underscored the challenges some royals face in communicating privately under intense media watch. The relationship between Princes William and Harry has been notably tense, a stark contrast to their once-close bond during their youth. The rift reportedly began before Harry's marriage to Meghan Markle, with Harry suggesting William had acted snobbishly towards his then-fiancee. However, the situation deteriorated further following the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, especially after the serious allegations Harry made against William in his explosive memoir, 'Spare', and his Netflix series. In 'Spare', published shortly after the Queen's death, Harry claimed that William had physically assaulted him, knocking him into a dog bowl during an argument about Meghan. During his recent trips back to the UK, Harry has not had any meetings with William or his wife Kate, and has only met once with his father, King Charles.

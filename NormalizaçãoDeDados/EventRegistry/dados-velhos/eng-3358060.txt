stall at Kotrupi near Padder in Mandi around midnight when the landslide swept everything in its way for about eight hundred meters and washed away a short stretch of the road.\n\nSo far, all the forty-six bodies have been recovered with three dead from the first bus and 42 from the second, of which 23 have been identified. A biker was also killed in the calamity.\n\nThe Jogindernagar-Mandi section of the Pathankot- Mandi National highway has been closed.\n\nThe district administration has advised people to take the Mandi-Kullu route via Kalota.\n\nThe two buses belonged to the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC). The air-conditioned bus carrying 47 passengers to Manali from Chamba, has also been retrieved now, said sources while the bus heading to Katra from Manali with eight passengers was wrecked. Three people died as it was the first to be hit by the landslide.\n\nTwo of the deceased include bus driver Chandan Sharma and conductor Satpal.\n\nMandi deputy commissioner Sandeep Kadam said, \"Twenty four bodies were recovered and five rescued after a long operation. The death toll could rise as the search continues. Rescue teams were digging throughout the day to find survivors trapped in the rubble.''\n\n24 bodies were recovered by search and rescue teams comprising Army and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel and state administration. Five people were admitted to the Manali zonal hospital.\n\nThe other deceased were identified as Rajesh of Dharamsala, Manju of Karsog, Sachvetra of Rampur, Anita of Mandi, Beauty Sharma of Patna, Bihar, Shubam of Pathankot and Rajesh of Dharamsala.\n\nHimachal Pradesh Transport Minister GS Bali said that according to information the bus was packed. Chief minister Virbhadra Singh visited the spot and announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased.\n\nVirbhadra Singh said rescue operations would continue until every body was found. He directed an assessment of loss to property at the earliest so that compensation and assistance could be provided. Singh also met the victims' kin.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \"Pained by the loss of lives due to landslide related accidents in HP's Mandi district, my condolences with the families of the deceased.''\n\nThis is said to be the third such big accident involving landslides and buses in the state.

after a landslide buried two buses on the Mandi-Pathankot highway near Joginder Nagar in Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh on Saturday night.\n\nSources said both buses had stopped at a roadside tea stall at Kotrupi near Padder in Mandi around midnight when the landslide swept everything in its way for about eight hundred meters and washed away a short stretch of the road.\n\nThe two buses belonged to the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC). The air-conditioned bus carrying 47 passengers to Manali from Chamba, has also been retrieved now, said sources while the bus heading to Katra from Manali with eight passengers was wrecked. Three people died as it was the first to be hit by the landslide.\n\nTwo of the deceased include bus driver Chandan Sharma and conductor Satpal.\n\nMandi deputy commissioner Sandeep Kadam said, \"Twenty four bodies were recovered and five rescued after a long operation. The death toll could rise as the search continues. Rescue teams were digging throughout the day to find survivors trapped in the rubble.''\n\n24 bodies were recovered by search and rescue teams comprising Army and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel and state administration. Five people were admitted to the Manali zonal hospital.\n\nThe other deceased were identified as Rajesh of Dharamsala, Manju of Karsog, Sachvetra of Rampur, Anita of Mandi, Beauty Sharma of Patna, Bihar, Shubam of Pathankot and Rajesh of Dharamsala.\n\nHimachal Pradesh Transport Minister GS Bali said that according to information the bus was packed. Chief minister Virbhadra Singh visited the spot and announced an ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the kin of the deceased.\n\nVirbhadra Singh said rescue operations would continue until every body was found. He directed an assessment of loss to property at the earliest so that compensation and assistance could be provided. Singh also met the victims' kin.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, \"Pained by the loss of lives due to landslide related accidents in HP's Mandi district, my condolences with the families of the deceased.''\n\nThis is said to be the third such big accident involving landslides and buses in the state. In 1994, 42 people were killed in a landslide at Luggar Hati in Kullu district and in 1988 around 45 passengers were buried in a landslide near Matiyana in Shimla.", "time": "15:40:00"}

Six bodies had been recovered so far but there were fears for many more still missing, said Sandeep Kadam, a senior official at the scene. \"The other bus has been swept away, 800 metres down the steep hillside.

five people have perished in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district on Sunday, when two buses carrying over 40 passengers were buried under a massive landslide.\n\nThe death toll is expected to go up as many passengers are still missing or buried under the debris in Kotrupi on the Mandi-Pathankot highway.\n\nIncessant rainfall and loose rocks caused the landslide in which an entire side of the hill came crashing down on the road. One of the two buses were buried under tons of rock and mud, while the other was swept 800 metres off the road. The two buses were enroute Manal Katra and Mani Manali, when the accident took place in Kotrupi.\n\nA cloud burst is feared to have triggered the landslide that has destroyed a 250 metre stretch of the road. There are also concerns that in addition to the two buses, there could be other vehicles trapped under the mud.\n\nSeveral rescue teams are now trying to dig through the rocks and slush to trace the missing passengers. While five bodies have been dug out so far, six injured passengers have been shifted to a hospital in Padhar town nearby.\n\nThe National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) has been called to the spot even as Army rescue teams and civilian bodies armed with private earthmovers are trying to make its way through the rubble.\n\nHundreds of tons of rock and mud are posing a challenge to the rescue agencies, while minor landslides continue to rattle the site.\n\nThe routes on Mandi-Pathankot Highway (NH-154) have been diverted at three different locations and the new routes are Ghatasi-Jhadigri-Katindi-Mandi, Jogindernagar-Nauni-Padhar and Jogindernagar-Dharampur-Potli-Mandi.\n\nAngry locals criticised the state leaders including the health minister for not reaching the spot to oversee operations. State transport minister GS Bali said additional forces are on their way to Kotrupi to help the relief and rescue operations.", "time": "05:51:00"}

India said that 27 dead bodies were recovered and five people were rescued after a huge rescue operation since last night.\n\nHe said that there is a possibility that the death toll would go up as the rescue team is still continuing their search for many trapped inside the mud.\n\nThe tragedy took place around 12.20 AM near Kotpori village in Jogindernagar on the Mandi-Pathankot highway located some 220 km away from Shimla, the famous tourist destination.\n\nTwo government transport buses heading to Chamba from Manali in Himachal Pradesh and Katra in Jammu and Kashmir were washed away in the incident as the buses stopped there for refreshments.\n\nDead bodies of nine passengers traveling in one of these buses which carried 47 passengers were retrieved while three dead bodies were recovered from the other bus.\n\nThe remaining dead are from the local residents. The villagers said that they escaped running from their houses when they sensed that the tragedy was to befall as some boulders started rolling down ahead of the disaster.

The debris first fell on four houses,luckily none was at home. The Manali-bound bus was second causality. The bus according to state transport minister GS Bali was carrying over 40 passengers.\n\nThe bus driver did not get a chance to save himself and the passengers as the amount of debris was enormous and beyond imagination. The volume of the landslide matter can be estimated from the fact that parts of bus were recovered from a distance of one km from the road.\n\nRESCUE OPERATIONS ON\n\nMore than 40 people were feared killed in the Mandi landslide incident. The local administration began the rescue operations at 2.30am and so far has recovered a dozen bodies of passengers. Rescue was on to locate nearly two dozen missing passengers. The number of missing passengers could be higher as the exact number of passengers travelling in Manali-bound bus is not known. However, the chances are very slim as the bus in which they were travelling was broken into pieces by the boulders. The local administration has, however, said the rescue will continue till all the bodies are recovered.\n\nAnother bus, which also met with an accident after the huge landslides occurred, was on its way to Katra.\n\nAccording to the local administration there were 8 passengers including the bus staff when it was trapped under the landslide. While two passengers died on the spot 6 injured passengers were rescued early Sunday morning.\n\nThe survivors also include the bus driver and conductor.\n\nPerson who cheated death\n\nMeet Ramesh Kumar, a local resident, who cheated death when a mountain slipped and fell on 50 passengers.\n\nRamesh, along with his friend, was on a motorbike on this road .They stopped when boulders started falling down. While Ramesh stopped ,his friend who was standing in the middle of the road was killed.\n\n\"I can still recollect the horror.

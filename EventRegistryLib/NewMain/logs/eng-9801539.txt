However, it is a new day in the DMV area as the franchise has undergone a facelift at the ownership level, with the coaching staff, and the roster.\n\nThe whole premise behind the Commanders new thought process is based off years of either not being good or being mediocre at best and by overhauling and cutting the fat while bringing in freshness to the organization they have hopes that they have everything in order to turn the page on their lackluster performances recently.\n\nA large part of the Commanders success will likely hinge on recently drafted quarterback Jayden Daniels, who at this point in training camp, is showing great signs of development and is picking things up fairly quickly for a rookie.\n\nWith how Daniels and the team have performed thus far into camp, people are starting to notice, especially with him being the second overall pick in the draft and the team being in a large market, and their power ranking in the NFL in on the rise as they head into their first preseason game of 2024.\n\nIn NFL.com's most recent preseason Power Rankings, the Commanders have risen three spots to number 26.\n\nREAD MORE: Washington Commanders Coach Kliff Kingsbury 'Couldn't Be More Pleased' With Backfield\n\n\"The Jayden Daniels buzz has me twitching a little bit. The Commanders have received another incremental bump since the start of the offseason, and this is one of the teams I'm more anxious to watch in the preseason,\" says NFL.com's Eric Edholm. \"Mostly because of Daniels, admittedly, as he's inching closer to my preseason Offensive Rookie of the Year pick. It would be something else if Daniels outplayed No. 1 pick Caleb Williams, a D.C. native, in 2024, ushering in a debate over which QB has the better future. Look, this situation isn't vastly different situation from the one the Texans were in one year ago. Washington has a new, defensive-minded, player-friendly coach. A precocious rookie QB. New energy and hope in the building. Plus just enough playmakers on each side of the ball. I'm not saying the Commanders are winning both their division and a home playoff game, as Houston did in 2023. But the Texans started 0-2 and 3-4, and they entered Week 17 on the outside of the playoff picture last season. I realize this ranking doesn't currently reflect it, but I'm prepared to push Washington up soon. Just a feeling.\"\n\nThere is a lot to like about what the Commanders did this offseason. From coaching to roster build, they seem to have a found something that will work and has the potential to blossom as long as everyone's mindset remains the status quo. For the Commanders to continue climbing the power rankings of the NFL they will need the best out of their rookie QB and for everyone else around him to play up to the level that is expected of an NFL contending team.\n\nREAD MORE: What CB Mike Sainristil Loves About His Role With The Washington Commanders\n\n* Former Washington Commanders Tight End Lands With NFC East Rival Philadelphia Eagles\n\n* Washington Commanders Add Offensive Tackle to Roster On Eve of Jets Joint Practice\n\n* Washington Commanders Rookie OT Taking 'First Good Step' in Training Camp", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliff_Kingsbury", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kliff Kingsbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1320,h_742,x_0,y_21/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/commander_country/01j4pc9tr6ty2jqptn3w.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

As for their chances in 2024 specifically?\n\nDespite being a trainwreck for much of the 2000s, the Commanders have quietly won seven or more games in seven of the past nine seasons, including three of the last four.\n\nThe bottom fell out last year, though, as they ended the season 4-13 and were rewarded with the second overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. That was the pick they used on Daniels, and that pick could immediately change the Commanders' future.\n\nFor 2024, though, the books are not expecting the Commanders to take a huge leap. Their win total is priced at a low 6.5 over/under, while the most optimistic book on them to make the playoffs is DraftKings, which is still only giving them a 27% chance to make the playoffs.\n\nWashington Commanders 2024 Betting Outlook\n\nThis year's Commanders team looks completely different than last year's team, almost across the board.\n\nThe franchise cleaned house with the coaching staff, firing head coach Ron Rivera and bringing in Dan Quinn, with Kliff Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator and Joe Whitt Jr. as the defensive coordinator.\n\nKingsbury will run the show on offense, so he can essentially be viewed as the head coach of the offense, as Quinn is a defensive-minded head coach. Of course, for 2024 specifically, the Commanders will not be defined by wins and losses, but more so how Daniels looks.\n\nNow, let's dive into Washington's 6.5 win total over/under.\n\nWhat will Jayden Daniels look like in his rookie season?\n\nWhether the 2024 season is a successful one for the Commanders all depends on the answer to this question. Daniels, the second-overall pick in the 2024 draft out of LSU, put up gaudy numbers his last year in college that won him the Heisman Trophy.\n\nDaniels was somewhat of a one-year wonder in college, as he did not have much success as a passer prior to his final year at LSU, but so was Joe Burrow, and Burrow has been just fine at the NFL level.\n\nDespite being the second pick in the draft, Daniels actually has some good weapons around him. PFF only gives them the 20th-ranked receiving core in the NFL, but Terry McLaurin is a stud and a bona fide no. 1 receiver in the NFL, while third-year WR Jahan Dotson showed potential in his rookie year but was less effective last year.\n\nIf Dotson can recapture what he showed in 2022, then that is an above-average 1-2 wide receiver combo.\n\nWashington's starting running back (Austin Ekeler) and starting tight end (Zach Ertz) would look a lot better if it was the year 2020, but it is never a bad idea to give a rookie QB multiple respected veterans to learn from.\n\nBehind Ertz at tight end is rookie Ben Sinnott, who is not projected to do much in 2024 but is a prospect that the Commanders are excited about.\n\nThe biggest issue with this offense, though, is its offensive line. Washington completely overhauled its line from last year, with a projected three new starters in 2024. Cornelius Lucas, who is a career backup, is the projected starting left tackle, with former Chiefs backup Nick Allegretti projected to start at left guard and ex-Cowboy Tyler Biadasz projected to be the starting center.\n\nDaniels does have the running chops to scramble if the line is consistently getting beat, but we have seen plenty of examples of a bad offensive line stunting a QB's development, so we just have to hope that is not the case with Daniels.\n\nOverall, it would be unrealistic to expect consistency from this Commanders offense, but they will likely have three to five games this year where the explosiveness of Daniels comes out, giving fans hope for the future.\n\nCan Quinn get the Commanders defense to average?\n\nWhile the offense has the potential to put up huge numbers in specific matchups, it is hard to have any type of excitement over the Commanders defense. They finished with the second-worst defense in NFL last year, according to DVOA, with the worst passing defense by far.\n\nThe Commanders traded away two of their best pass rushers in Chase Young and Montez Sweat in the middle of the season last year. After those deals, their defense went from bad to a disaster. From Week 5 to the end of the year, they allowed the most passing yards and passing touchdowns per game, and 2024 does not project to be much better.\n\nProFootballNetwork projects the Commanders to have the No. 26 defense in the NFL, with the most glaring issue being their secondary, which PFF projects to be the third-worst secondary heading into 2024. PFF gives Washington's linebacker (No. 17) and defensive line units (No. 19) both a below-average ranking as well.\n\nQuinn was able to coach up an elite unit in Dallas, but the talent in Washington is stratospheres away from what he had to work with in Dallas, so patience should be expected with this unit in 2024.\n\nWhile there is legitimate hope for the future in Washington, that future is for 2025 and beyond, not for 2024. The guess here is that Daniels is going to have moments when you can see the potential, but will be inconsistent overall, which is a completely normal season for a rookie.\n\nIf the offensive line can be better than projected, then there is a chance the Commanders could sneak out seven wins, but the more likely scenario is that they win six or fewer, making the under the play here.", "source":

Washington was in New Jersey for a joint practice with the New York Jets ahead of their preseason game Saturday.\n\nThe weather -- rainy and gloomy -- often matched Washington's performance. The Commanders were without part of their projected starting offensive line. The Jets held out quarterback Aaron Rodgers due to the rainy conditions.\n\nNext up is Saturday's game between the Commanders and Jets. What type of performance can we expect from Washington that we didn't see on Thursday?\n\nHere are six takeaways from Thursday's practice.\n\nGood work for Jayden Daniels\n\nJul 26, 2024; Ashburn, VA, USA; Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels (5) passes the ball during warmup before day three of training camp at Commanders Park. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIf you didn't get to see Washington practice against the Jets, don't go on social media looking to find out how quarterback Jayden Daniels performed. He was fine. He completed one deep ball to Dyami Brown, but most of the Commanders offense was short and quick. This was Daniels' first time against a defense other than his own, and the Jets have one of the NFL's better defensive units.\n\nThe goal of these practices is for your team to face different looks. That goal was accomplished. Daniels received several snaps in less-than-ideal conditions against an excellent defense. The Jets are outstanding at every level. No one on Washington's sideline came away from this practice discouraged about Daniels. In fact, it's likely the opposite.\n\nIt was a bad day for Emmanuel Forbes\n\nThis tweet sums up everything. He got beat multiple times and allegedly tried to pick a fight. That's not what anyone wants to hear about Forbes. He's had a mostly solid training camp and everyone was excited to see him against another team to see how he progressed. Instead, it was more of the same. Let's not write Forbes off after a bad practice. After all, it is one practice. but eyes will be on him Saturday and next week when the Commanders face the Dolphins in a joint practice. Forbes did have an interception at one point, but all anyone is going to remember are the videos of Garrett Wilson taking him to the woodshed multiple times.\n\nOffensive line depth remains a concern\n\nIt was very disappointing to see rookie offensive tackle Brandon Coleman not practicing. Outside of Daniels, he was probably the player most wanted to see. Facing a strong New York front, how would Coleman hold up? With the weather, it made sense to hold Coleman out. He doesn't appear to be seriously hurt. Washington needs to see Coleman against opposing defenses to have a better understanding of where he is heading into the season.\n\nShould the Commanders sign another offensive tackle? They signed one this week, but that was a depth signing. If Washington adds another offensive lineman, it needs to be one who can come in and play immediately. There aren't many available.\n\nPass rush a bright spot\n\nThere's no doubt that Washington needed help rushing the passer this offseason. However, the Commanders believe their interior duo of Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne will be active rushing the passer, while also creating opportunities for the edge rushers. Linebacker Frankie Luvu flashed on Thursday, but that's not a surprise. Dorance Armstrong will also be fine, too.\n\nThe name to watch here is rookie Javontae Jean-Baptiste. Before camp began, Jean-Baptiste looked more like a project who'd spend his rookie season on the practice squad. However, he's quietly had a good camp and is a player to watch on Saturday.\n\nThe kicker is not on the roster\n\nWhen the Commanders signed Riley Patterson to compete with Ramiz Ahmed, it sure looked like he'd be the kicker this season. However, Patterson has looked no better than Ahmed during his short stint with the team. When final cuts begin, other kickers will be cut. General manager Adam Peters may be waiting for that to happen.\n\nNeither had a good day on Thursday. It is important to note that it was raining, but it will rain during the season, too, and teams expect kickers to make those kicks. Patterson has had some NFL success and is still young. Ahmed has never kicked in an NFL game. The games will matter for these two.\n\nIt's one practice\n\nHaven't we said that already? Sam Fortier of The Washington Post explained this the best. Perhaps fans were a little excited based on training camp clips. Thursday was just one practice. If it happens during Saturday's game and into the next joint practice and the final two preseason games, then we have ourselves a problem. The Commanders improved in some areas as practice progressed on Thursday. There is confidence in this coaching staff, unlike the previous one. Head coach Dan Quinn and his staff will have plenty to evaluate in all three phases. That's a good thing.\n\nEveryone should remember this is the first year of a rebuild, even if the Commanders do not want to say it. They need to show improvement throughout the year. No one expects a Super Bowl this year.", "source": {"uri": "commanderswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Commanders Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But the Washington Commanders have seen enough from their rookie to anoint him as the team's starting quarterback.\n\nHowever, on Saturday, we'll finally get our first chance to witness the Heisman winner play, even if it's just a preseason matchup with the New York Jets. Yet, the Jets have been scrimmaging against the Commanders this week in training camp, so some of Gang Green's players have already gotten a firsthand look at the former LSU superstar. One is already very impressed with what he's seen.\n\nRelated: NFL Playoff Predictions: Can Jayden Daniels lead the Commanders to the postseason?\n\nAs a two-time All-Pro despite having played just two seasons, Sauce Gardner is already one of the NFL's best cornerbacks. Maybe, someday Jayden Daniels will join him among the NFL's elite players. But Gardner believes the Washington QB is already off to a strong start.\n\n\"He gonna be nice. We were just joking with each other. I know LSU, I know they talk a lot, so you know, when we first lined up, I was talking, like 'He young,' I was just trolling him and you know, he was smiling out there. I just told him, 'You're going to be real good man.' Feels great to just be able to line up against him. As a corner, you want to go against a rookie quarterback, but he's one of those guys, like, he's developed, obviously. You know, he was drafted that high, but he had some great throws out there.\"\n\nIf Daniels can spread the ball around to the likes of Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, and Zach Ertz while displaying his trademark rushing ability, he'll be well on his way to competing for Offensive Rookie of the Year. Yet, the Commanders hope Daniels can make an impact in the win column after going 4-13-1 last season. It was their second consecutive last-place finish in the NFC East.\n\nThe competition won't get any easier in the East this season, but Daniels has sky-high potential. If he's the real deal, he might just be able to turn the Commanders into a contender, quickly. We saw it last year with CJ Stroud and the Houston Texans, who won just three games the season before. But rookie quarterbacks rarely have such a significant impact. Maybe Daniels can buck that trend too.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_buller_russ@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Andrew Buller-Russ", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce_Gardner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauce Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahan_Dotson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahan Dotson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Ertz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Ertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NFL-Washington-Commanders-Training-Camp-23829052.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He'd probably love to play all the snaps and win by multiple touchdowns, although preseason games quickly are forgotten once the clock ticks down to zero.\n\nAnd the stats would be huge as well. Commanders offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said no one sets goals higher than Daniels, the former LSU star and No. 2 player of this year's NFL Draft.\n\n\"I think he is just putting in the work to reach the level that he expects himself to play at this year, which is probably higher than what any of us could imagine,\" Kingsbury told reporters. \"But I just see day in, day out, its consistency in his approach, his consistency in how he treats people and how he studies, how he works. And when you continue to do those things and stack those days, you're going to get the results you want.\"\n\nThe Commanders want to be better than last season. That's a minimal goal considering Washington finished with a 4-13 record. It's why they were in position to select Daniels, last year's Heisman Trophy winner. He went right after USC's Caleb Williams, but ahead of every other quarterback.\n\nNew Washington coach Dan Quinn announced this week that Daniels was No. 1 on the depth chart. Quinn said Daniels earned the spot. The Commanders will play the Jets to kick off the preseason. Marcus Mariota remains Plan B.\n\nQuinn said of Daniels: \"I had high expectations for him coming in, but I would say he's definitely surpassed even my expectations of the readiness, the command. I knew he was gonna be cool, knowing the system. He's just got that way about him. You do see the other players gravitate toward him. They recognize how hard he's worked at it.\"\n\nDon't expect for Daniels to play a ton in the preseason opener. But he's still getting the work. The Jets and Commanders conducted a joint practice Thursday. That's where Daniels got the most productive snaps.\n\nAs for the young quarterback, he did spell out his specific goals earlier this week.\n\n\"How sharp can we be? How fast can we execute our offense?\" Daniels told reporters, as he ticked off the check list. \"Limit the pre-snap and post-snap penalties. Go out there and try to execute at a high level. It's my first one ever, so I don't know what I'm getting myself into, so it'd be a surprise for me, but just go out there and have fun.\"\n\n\"I love the process,\" Kingsbury said of Daniels. \"I love how he approaches each day, how he handles the good, the bad, all the installs.

Guard Sam Cosmi was back from his two-day absence but didn't participate in the team portions either.\n\nIn their place, the mostly second-team offensive line struggled mightily against the New York pass rush and as a result quarterback Jayden Daniels was under pressure for most of the day.\n\nThis led to short pass attempts and hurried throws that fell mostly incomplete. On one rep, Jets defensive end Will McDonald IV hit Daniels' arm knocking the ball loose. It's a no-no to touch the quarterback in practice, but is also an example of how dominant the New York pass rush was on Thursday.\n\nROOKIE QUARTERBACK\n\nDaniels is a rookie. One who knows he has much room to grow before being crowned the franchise savior so many hope he will be.\n\nIf he needed proof of this, it came on Thursday.\n\nWhile the pressure isn't something he can control, he's going to look back at the tape and wish he'd handled certain moments better. For the first time all training camp we saw Daniels consistently throw the ball into double and even triple coverage, putting the ball at risk in ways he hasn't been doing back in Ashburn.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE DEFENSE?\n\nOur perch at the Jets facility made it a little difficult to fully observe the Washington first-team defense going up against the New York offense, but we got a good look at something that isn't going to make many people happy.\n\nSecond-year cornerback Emmanuel Forbes did reportedly have an interception during the 7-on-7s portion of practice but during the full team sessions he more than gave that one back to Jets receiver Garrett Wilson.\n\nJust see the following video posting for evidence of this.\n\nOverall, however, the defense looked fast and the pass rush does look improved from what we saw last year.\n\nDefensive tackle Jonathan Allen told us after the practice that they're obviously not where they want to be yet. That may be a bit of an understatement. The good news is there's still time to fix the deficiencies we saw on Thursday, and may see again on Saturday.\n\nREAD MORE: Washington Commanders Rookie OT Taking 'First Good Step' in Training Camp\n\n* Dan Quinn Wants to See One Certain Thing At Commanders' Joint Practice With Jets\n\n* Washington Commanders On The Rise In Latest NFL Preseason Power Rankings\n\n* Former Washington Commanders Tight End Lands With NFC East Rival Philadelphia Eagles", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_harrison@si.com", "name": "David Harrison", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Saleh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Saleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_McDonald_IV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will McDonald IV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cosmi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cosmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Forbes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashburn,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashburn, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashburn, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2135,h_1200,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/commander_country/01j4sfhprnv1bkm197k4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

That led to the Washington Commanders drafting him second overall in the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nThe rookie pivot is likely to be the starter for the Commanders during the regular season, barring some unexpected setbacks in training camp or preseason play. That starts with Washington head coach Dan Quinn marking Daniels as QB1 for Saturday afternoon.\n\nHowever, Daniels will get a tough test in his first matchup. He's facing off against a New York Jets defense that allowed only 168.3 passing yards per game last season, keeping New York competitive despite Aaron Rodgers' season-ending injury.\n\nThe Jets aren't likely to give many reps to their starting defenders in Saturday's game, but that hasn't meant much historically, as the team has used the preseason to show off its defensive depth in recent years.\n\nThat has been particularly true against rookie quarterbacks. Last year, the Jets faced No. 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young in exhibition action, holding Young to just one first down in three possessions and preventing the rookie from completing a single pass of over eight yards.\n\nWith Washington looking to answer questions about its wide receiver depth -- Brycen Tremayne and Mitch Tinsley are likely to be fighting for roster spots, while starters like Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson get limited, if any, playing time -- it's unlikely that Daniels will benefit from any spectacular play against one of the best secondaries in football.\n\nThe Jets won't be focusing much on their first-team offense, either. In New York's case, that's being done to protect their veteran arms.\n\nIt's no surprise that the Jets want to protect Rodgers after what happened last year, but they'll also be sitting 35-year-old backup Tyrod Taylor. Rookie Jordan Travis is also injured, meaning undrafted rookie Andrew Peasley and UFL MVP Adrian Martinez will be sharing QB duties for New York.\n\nNone of this is a recipe for a high-scoring game, even by preseason standards.

The Jets will host the Commanders on Saturday in the preseason opener for both teams.\n\nFans are excited to see Washington rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels go against a defense other than his own. How will Daniels respond? He's had a phenomenal summer, only continuing to improve with each practice. After splitting first-team reps with veteran Marcus Mariota during the first week of camp, Daniels has taken most of those reps recently.\n\nHow much will Daniels play in the preseason opener? As head coach Dan Quinn said earlier this week, what happens in the preseason opener could be much different than what happens in the joint practice. Some players will participate more in the scrimmage but will not play long in the game.\n\nWhich players need a strong showing this weekend against the Jets? We look at seven players who must perform well this weekend against New York, whether it's the joint practice or the game.\n\nWR Mitch Tinsley\n\nWashington Commanders wide receiver Mitchell Tinsley (86) catches a pass over Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Allan George (42) during the second half at FedExField. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe second-year wide receiver has quietly had a strong training camp. There are four locks for the 53-man roster: Terry McLaurin, Jahan Dotson, Luke McCaffrey, and Olamide Zaccheaus. Yes, Zaccheaus is a lock now. Washington will likely keep six, possibly seven receivers, depending on its plan for kick/punt returner.\n\nTinsley runs strong routes, has great hands, and creates separation. He will need to prove his worth on special teams. Tinsley secured a spot on last season's 53-man roster with a good preseason. He is poised to repeat that performance this summer.\n\nWR Brycen Tremayne\n\nJul 26, 2024; Ashburn, VA, USA; Washington Commanders wide receiver Brycen Tremayne (89) catches a pass on day three of training camp at Commanders Park. Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrycen Tremayne is one of the hottest names in training camp. Like Tinsley, Tremayne was an undrafted free agent last year. However, he didn't make the roster but spent the season on the practice squad. Tremayne has a lot going for him. He's easily the team's biggest receiver (6-foot-4) and is a relentless worker. Tremayne will win a spot on the roster or practice squad with his performance against the Jets in both the joint practice and the preseason game.\n\nTE Cole Turner\n\nDENVER, COLORADO - SEPTEMBER 17: Cole Turner #85 of the Washington Commanders celebrates after a play during the second quarter against the Washington Commanders at Empower Field At Mile High on September 17, 2023 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Jamie Schwaberow/Getty Images)\n\nCole Turner's path to making the roster improved after the Commanders released Armani Rogers this week. Turner and Rogers were competing to be Washington's fourth tight end. Rookie Ben Sinnott can play a hybrid role for the Commanders, lining up as a fullback/H-Back/tight end, while Ertz is the traditional starting tight end. John Bates is the primary blocking tight end. With Sinnott being able to move around, there's a good chance Washington keeps four tight ends instead of seven receivers. Turner must prove himself against another team. He has size and athleticism and has flashed in all three training camps since entering the NFL. It's time to do it against a quality defense like the Jets.\n\nOT Brandon Coleman\n\nNov 2, 2023; Lubbock, Texas, USA; Texas Christian Horned Frogs offensive tackle Brandon Coleman (77) blocks Texas Tech Red Raiders defensive tackle Tony Bradford Jr. (97) in the second half at Jones AT&T Stadium and Cody Campbell Field. Mandatory Credit: Michael C. Johnson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAll eyes are on rookie offensive tackle Brandon Coleman. He is atop the depth chart for Washington at left tackle. He's been impressive all summer. However, there is cautious optimism surrounding Coleman until he proves it against another team. One strong practice against the Jets doesn't mean Coleman is the future left tackle, but it could go a long way in outsiders saying Washington needs to sign another offensive tackle. Everyone is watching Coleman in the practice and the game.\n\nLB/DE Jamin Davis\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, NEW JERSEY - OCTOBER 22: Jamin Davis #52 of the Washington Commanders looks on prior to a game against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium on October 22, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (Photo by Dustin Satloff/Getty Images)\n\n2021 first-round pick Jamin Davis is clearly on the roster bubble. While the new depth chart means nothing, Davis was listed as a backup outside linebacker behind edge rusher Dante Fowler Jr. Davis has worked primarily as an edge rusher in training camp. Washington's top two linebackers are set with Bobby Wagner and Frankie Luvu. Davis must flash during the practice and the game. If he can't create any pressure, how can the Commanders justify keeping him over another young pass rusher? This is a massive weekend for Davis.\n\nC Ricky Stromberg\n\nWashington Commanders center Ricky Stromberg (53) prepares to block against the Cincinnati Bengals during the first half at FedExField. Mandatory Credit: Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n\nRicky Stromberg was a third-round pick last season. Some players from last season's team said he was Washington's best center. However, the former coaching staff never truly gave him a chance before he injured his knee and missed the second half of the season. The new regime meant a new opportunity for Stromberg, but the Commanders signed Tyler Biadasz as the team's center. Stromberg is listed as the No. 3 center behind Biadasz and Michael Dieter on the latest depth chart. Stromberg can play guard, too, so he needs to show something this entire preseason to stick around.\n\nCB Emmanuel Forbes\n\nWashington Commanders cornerback Emmanuel Forbes (13) reacts after being ejected for a personal foul during the first quarter at Lumen Field. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nForbes is not in danger of being cut. The second-year cornerback did everything asked of him by the new coaching staff this offseason. He's also had a solid start to training camp. But Forbes had such a bad rookie season that he needs to prove he can step up against opposing wide receivers. The Jets have some good receivers, primarily Garrett Wilson. Forbes needs some strong reps against players like Wilson for his own confidence. He lost his confidence last season, thanks to an inept coaching staff. Things have been going well for Forbes, but there's work to be done. That work begins on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "commanderswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Commanders Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_manning@commanderswire.usatoday.com",

As Daniels continues to build rapport with his pass catchers, the Commanders will hope these highlights continue to rack up in the regular season.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\" Enjoy more free NFL Draft coverage with NFL Draft on SI \u00e2\u20ac\"\u00c2\n\nProminent NFL insider weighs in on Caleb Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 progress", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliff_Kingsbury", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kliff Kingsbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3631,h_2042,x_0,y_151/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/nfl_draft/01j4ssez4by8z6e5cyvt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Rain is one thing. Thursday's steady showers, which morphed into a deluge at times, is another.\n\n\"I was prepared, as in they told me it was coming,\" the third-year wide receiver said. \"(I was also) ready, as in I was ready to go inside.\"\n\nWashington's execution on the field showed that, despite sunny reviews from its home practice, it remains a work in progress in all three phases.\n\nRookie quarterback Jayden Daniels took his first reps against one of the NFL's top defenses. The performance reflected the variance expected with first-year passers. The defense labored to keep up with Jets receiver Garrett Wilson, even without quarterback Aaron Rodgers suiting up, and the Commanders' two kickers struggled with accuracy in the elements.\n\nRegardless, these practices are about competition and growth, not the scoreboard. On that front, players left the field feeling content about working against a new team.\n\n\"It was fun. It was wet and rainy, but I had a good time out there,\" defensive tackle Jonathan Allen said. \"It's hard for me to tell (everything that happened) because half the time, I'm in the middle of six dudes, and it's chaotic in there. ... We're not where we want to be, but I don't think it's a bad start at all.\"\n\nPlaying behind a makeshift offensive line, Daniels unofficially finished 7-of-15 in 11-on-11 drills with minimal yardage while working primarily underneath. He also hit Dyami Brown deep during an early drill, with the receiver making a spectacular one-handed catch.\n\n\"I think he did a great job of processing,\" wide receiver Terry McLaurin said of Daniels. \"I felt like he did a great job of getting the ball out of his hands and making quick decisions, but that's what he's been doing all camp.\"\n\nPassing isn't the only aspect of the quarterback's play assessed by coaches and teammates, and they haven't forgotten about the weeks of work back home.\n\n\"It feels like the game is starting to slow down for him even more,\" McLaurin continued. \"Coming in, he had a great feel (for) his ball placement and his anticipation. I think that's what really sets him apart. ... He probably wants some (throws) back, but that's why we practice.\"\n\nTight end Zach Ertz was Daniels' favorite target. Following two short completions in full-team drills, one to each side of the formation, Daniels ripped a low and outside strike to McLaurin near the sideline.\n\n\"I know they love him,\" Jets coach Robert Saleh said. \"He's an impressive kid. Going through the evaluation process in the draft ... our building thought very highly of him.\"\n\nThough kept out of the padded practice because of the weather, Rodgers chatted with Daniels during special teams. Jets All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner also made a point of catching up with the rookie after trolling him in practice. He came away impressed.\n\nThe rookie's positive spirit is already top-notch.\n\n\"He did great having fun, which is important,\" left guard Nick Allegretti said. \"He is just excited to be playing football, which is what you need, to love playing this game. There's going to be stress. There's going to be pressure. But if you're not enjoying it, it's really going to get to you, and I think he's got a really good handle on that.\"\n\nTo help Daniels develop and have a functional offense in practice and preseason games, bolstering the offensive line is becoming vital. Not solely for the long-held concerns about the tackle options, but available bodies.\n\nThird-round pick Brandon Coleman, an emerging left tackle contender who wore a shoulder wrap Tuesday, did not participate in a second consecutive practice. Right tackle Andrew Wylie continued the pattern of dressing but not working in team drills. Right guard Sam Cosmi (illness) returned to practice after missing the previous two sessions in Virginia but wasn't an every-snap participant.\n\nFans shouted their collective desire to acquire tackles for months. Washington's front office couldn't snap its fingers to conjure up a Pro Bowl option. Upgrading Trent Scott's reserve spot seemed doable. There should be urgency now after the Jets' pass rushers exposed Scott's limitations.\n\nGuard Chris Paul took snaps at right tackle. His false start penalty erased Daniels' lone completion on a late two-minute drive. Another guard, Mason Brooks, was forced into a left tackle role with Braeden Daniels lined up on the right side of the line after working primarily inside during training camp. Alex Taylor, largely a practice squad player in his career, was signed Wednesday to join Cornelius Lucas and Scott as the only healthy pure tackles.\n\nKnowing the line must work as a unit, the personnel-shifting puts additional stress on the interior starters and overall efficiency. Penalties, often pre-snap, remain a summer concern.\n\n\"Whoever's next to me, right and left, that is who it is,\" Allegretti said. \"I try to do a good job of learning how they communicate, whether it's through practice or through meetings so that we don't really have any issues there.\"\n\nDaniels and Marcus Mariota aren't likely to play significant snaps Saturday. Coach Dan Quinn might keep them to minimal exposure if there aren't enough viable linemen available.\n\nWashington didn't game plan for the Jets' players. \"It's really about training your skills, your techniques,\" Quinn said.\n\nEven if they had, containing Wilson is a chore. There were times when the Jets' top receiver took over practice, hauling in passes from Tyrod Taylor and taking turns beating the Commanders' cornerbacks.\n\nThe front seven with Allen and linebacker Frankie Luvu had better success, and the defense studied the Jets in a two-minute drive phase.\n\n* Rain isn't a friend of kickers, and Ramiz Ahmed and Riley Patterson were erratic on field goal attempts. In one period, with each taking five attempts from 40 yards or longer, Ahmed missed his final three. Patterson followed with two off-target, including a wayward kick left. Practice ended with Ahmed ending a two-minute drive by missing from 51.\n\n* Wide receiver Brycen Tremayne continued catching contested deep passes. He grabbed two in seven-on-seven drills, and later took a rep or two with Daniels.\n\n* The team avoided the skirmishes that popped up in recent practices around the league, other than some pushing between Washington's defense and the Jets' offense.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_standig@nytimes.com", "name": "Ben Standig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahan_Dotson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jahan Dotson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce_Gardner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sauce Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Ertz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Ertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Saleh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Saleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braeden_Daniels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Braeden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Patterson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riley Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornelius Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Luvu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Luvu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrod_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrod Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Mariota", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Mariota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Paul"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/08/08181350/AP24219698918354-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Training camp has been a crucial period for assessing the team's progress and addressing concerns. With a renewed sense of unity and urgency, the Commanders are working towards a successful 2024 season.\n\nOne of the standout players in camp is veteran tight end Zach Ertz. After joining the Commanders in free agency and reuniting with offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury, Ertz has shown that he still has plenty to offer.\n\nDespite skepticism about his ability to perform after a challenging season with the Arizona Cardinals, Ertz has been impressive in training camp. His crisp routes, reliable hands, and leadership are providing valuable contributions to the team's offense. Ertz's role as a mentor to younger tight ends like Cole Turner and Ben Sinnott is also proving beneficial.\n\nWide receiver Jahan Dotson is another player making waves.

That's what defensive tackle Jon Allen said after a soggy joint practice Thursday that saw coach Dan Quinn's squad struggle in a downpour against the New York Jets.\n\nThe Commanders' offense, led by rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, looked out of sync all day and the defense had trouble stopping a Jets attack that lacked star quarterback Aaron Rodgers -- New York's coaches rested the 40-year-old signal-caller to prevent injury on the soaked fields.\n\nEven the special teams units underperformed: Kickers Riley Patterson and Ramiz Ahmed each missed several field goals.\n\n\"Obviously, we're not where we want to be,\" Allen said. \"But I don't think it's a bad start at all.\"\n\nQuinn has said he's pleased with his squad's development through offseason activities and training camp. But Thursday's joint practice was an important benchmark -- a first chance to see his players face NFL competition wearing something other than burgundy and gold.\n\n\"It's a lot of fun for a coach because you'll get a lot of film out of today,\" he said before emphasizing communication, ball security and speed. \"Those three things are top of the pile for me.\"\n\nThe two teams battled against the weather and each other, as steady rain kept the balls and the field slick. But that's part of football, several players noted.\n\nWide receiver Jahan Dotson said he was both prepared and ready for the less-than-ideal conditions.\n\n\"Prepared, as in, they told me it was going to rain. Ready, as in, I was ready to go inside,\" the Penn State product joked. \"It's good work though, because not every game is gonna be sunshine and rainbows. You never know the element you're gonna plan in on Sundays.\"\n\nPracticing with another team brings an intensity often missing from training camps. But Quinn told his players to avoid the fights that have dominated conversations at joint practices around the NFL.\n\n\"All we're looking to do is come and compete and battle and enjoy it,\" he said. \"Not looking for anything past that.\"\n\nHe got his wish, minus a chippy exchange between cornerback Emmanuel Forbes and Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson. The 2022 Offensive Rookie of the Year beat Forbes early and often during the team drills, leading to some light pushing and shoving after one play during 11-on-11 drills.\n\n\"They had some good concepts in there, stuff that gave us challenges,\" Commanders cornerback Mike Sainristil said of the Jets offense. \"I think the best thing for us is being able to go back to the film room and see what they did and learn from it.\"\n\nWhile Washington's secondary struggled, the highly-touted defensive line performed as advertised. The group, led by Allen, disrupted several plays at the line of scrimmage and applied pressure to New York's quarterbacks.\n\nBut Thursday's struggles extended to all three phases of the Commanders' roster, as the kickers underperformed and the offense struggled to find explosive plays.\n\nWashington's rookie quarterback was mostly held to check-down passes as New York's pass rush bore down on him. The Commanders' offensive line -- which was missing projected starters Brandon Coleman, Andrew Wylie and Sam Cosmi -- was no match for the Jets' star-studded pash rush.\n\nThe reigning Heisman Trophy winner fared better during the 7-on-7 drills, including a deep pass down the right sideline that wide receiver Dyami Brown grabbed with one hand.\n\n\"He's gonna be nice,\" Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner said, noting that he and Daniels exchanged pre-snap trash talk throughout the day. \"He had some great throws out there.\"\n\nThe film from Thursday's practice, from the great throws to the blown coverage, will inform Washington's preparation as they look toward the regular season.\n\n\"We still have room for improvement,\" cornerback Michael Davis said. \"That's what we're going to do: go back to the drawing board and watch the film and see what we can correct.\"\n\nThe recently overhauled Burgundy and Gold will have another shot at the Jets on Saturday during their preseason opener at MetLife Stadium. For rookies like Daniels, Coleman and Sainristil, the game will be their first taste of an NFL gameday.\n\n\"They've been waiting their whole lives to play in the NFL,\" Quinn said. \"My message to them will be: You've already been doing it every day in practice.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_griffin@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Liam Griffin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Patterson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riley Patterson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Forbes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahan_Dotson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jahan Dotson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penn State Nittany Lions football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce_Gardner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sauce Gardner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cosmi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Cosmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Benchmarking_and_Best_Practices", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Benchmarking and Best Practices", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Noahidism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Noahidism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/08/06/Commanders_Football_43784_c0-230-5500-3436_s1770x1032.jpg?219bcb365c9400fdeb1dd4ed0bff20751ade7461", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801539", "eventUri": "eng-9801539", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Keep in mind that Quinn stressed it was a preliminary, unofficial depth chart; he half-joked that vice president of football operations Sean DeBarbieri played a large role in creating it. Joint practices and preseason games will reveal much more.\n\nStill, it provides some insights as to where things stand ahead of joint practices and the preseason opener. Here are three major ones, outside the quarterback announcement:\n\n1. Brandon Coleman at left tackle\n\nDaniels' blindside -- for now -- will be protected by another rookie, third-round selection Brandon Coleman. The TCU product has impressed in camp with his athleticism and ability to acclimate after he played both guard and tackle for the Horned Frogs.\n\nStill, it's just been a few weeks of practice, and Quinn knows that. He singled Coleman out as a player he's particularly interested in watching against the Jets' talented defense.\n\n\"Anything we ask Brandon to do, he's shown up and he's tried it,\" offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said. \"A lot of times with young rookies, they're used to a certain technique that may not be able to work at this level, and so you got to adjust it. And he's tried to do it exactly how we've coached, and he's a tremendous athlete and works his tail off, so we like his progress.\"\n\nShould Coleman remain the starter, he'd be Washington's first rookie to start a season opener at left tackle since Trent Williams in 2010.\n\n2. Wide receiver spots are wide open\n\nTerry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson are the clear top two wide receivers, and Dyami Brown has drawn praise for his work and is listed as a second-stringer behind McLaurin. After that, there are far more players than spots available, and the next few weeks will be key in determining who Daniels' targets will be.\n\n\"We know of a couple that for sure are going to be on the team and what you're going to get,\" Kingsbury said. \"And then there's a group there that we're still waiting to see what they can do, how they fit in our offense, how to best maximize them. I think the guys that are able to do more -- if you can move them inside, move them outside in our system -- are the ones that are going to have a chance to stick.\"\n\nOlamide Zaccheaus is listed as the starting slot wide receiver. That's pretty consistent with where he has fit in during camp, getting plenty of run with first- and second-stringers alike. Zaccheaus was with Quinn in 2019 and 2020 in Atlanta and posted a career-high 533 yards receiving for the Falcons in 2022. He was with the Eagles last season. Zaccheaus is directly in front of fourth-round rookie Luke McCaffrey in that spot. McCaffrey, a converted quarterback, has some promising upside but is still learning the nuances of the position.\n\nBrycen Tremayne has made some big downfield catches and, at 6-foot-4, provides the room with some size. Davion Davis has made some athletic catches throughout camp, and Mitchell Tinsley has had moments as well. Jamison Crowder, Kazmeir Allen and recently acquired Byron Pringle can all help in the return game, which has taken on new importance with the rule changes. Zaccheaus has also been used in that aspect, too, and if coaches deem he can fill two roles, that will leave one fewer opening.\n\n3. Deep competition at safety\n\nSafety is arguably the team's deepest position. Jeremy Chinn and Quan Martin are listed as starters, with last year's starter, Darrick Forrest, and special-teams ace Jeremy Reaves behind them. Percy Butler, a very good athlete who can help on special teams, and sixth-round pick Dominique Hampton occupy third-string roles, and intriguing undrafted rookie Tyler Owens is a fourth-stringer.\n\nSorting this out will require some time -- and some tough decisions. Chinn and Martin seem to be relatively entrenched as starters, and Butler has gotten a lot of work with the second team and the first team, especially with Forrest out recently. Reaves is a former captain and a clear leader, not just among the defensive backs, but on the team as a whole. And then there's Owens, who has made a penchant for being around the ball and is an excellent athlete.\n\n\"I'm really excited, man,\" Owens said Tuesday of the chance to face a new team. \"I just want to go out here and compete, do it on the biggest of stages. It's been my dream, so it's great.\"\n\nTuesday's practice was the final one before the team heads to Florham Park, New Jersey, for a pair of joint practices with Aaron Rodgers and Co. and also the final one with fans in attendance. Despite temperatures soaring to near 90 degrees and plenty of humidity making it feel hotter, the fans showed out in impressive fashion to watch Washington practice in shells. Here are some of the main takeaways from the session:\n\nOffenseDaniels got most of the first-team work, though it was behind a makeshift offensive line that included Trent Scott at right tackle, Cornelius Lucas at left tackle and Michael Deiter at guard.Starting right tackle Andrew Wylie continues to miss time with \"tightness,\" while Coleman and starting right guard Sam Cosmi (illness) did not participate. Washington is expected to work out offensive linemen, per The Athletic's Ben Standig.Still, Daniels had some good moments. That included a lofted ball to Zach Ertz, who made a fantastic one-handed stab to reel in the ball alongside the sideline in front of Jeremy Reaves. Ertz has had some nice moments in camp, and this was another one.Daniels followed that up with another pretty deep ball to Tremayne, who continues to flash. Tremayne beat Michael Davis on the play. Tremayne also took a short swing pass for a considerable gain -- though it can be hard to tell without pads -- in a later 11-on-11 session.Ertz probably had the catch of the day, but Dotson made a great adjustment on a wobbly Marcus Mariota pass down the middle of the field. The speedy third-year wide out had a step or two on the defense but slowed down, tracked the ball and made the grab while going to the ground in between two defenders. Dotson has been busy all training camp.Brian Robinson Jr. and Austin Ekeler both had some nice runs. They are listed as co-starters on the depth chart, and they will both figure prominently.Like Tremayne, Davion Davis has had some nice catches, and that continued on one-on-ones, when he and Mariota connected on a touchdown against Noah Igbinoghene.DefenseThe Commanders continue to rotate a ton of bodies defensively, and the highlight of the day was a diving interception from reserve safety Ben Nikkel. The ball was tipped, and Nikkel laid all the way out to reel it in. Javontae Jean-Baptiste had a nice move inside to create some disruption up front.Jean-Baptiste and K.J. Henry continue to flash as the potential young depth behind Dorance Armstrong, Clelin Ferrell and Dante Fowler Jr. Henry and Frankie Luvu combined to create some pressure on Daniels early in an 11-on-11 session.Jamin Davis, who has played linebacker throughout his career but has mostly been an edge defender this training camp, seems to be behind both Jean-Baptiste and Henry in the pecking order. Switching positions is never easy, and while Davis has impressive physical tools, it's clear he has a long way to go as an edge rusher. The 2021 first-rounder is listed as Fowler's backup as outside linebacker on the depth chart.Bobby Wagner's veteran presence is felt up and down the roster. On one 11-on-11 rep, Wagner beat running back Jeremy McNichols, who was in protection. During field goal drills at the end of practice, Wagner went over to the offensive side and talked to McNichols. In one-on-ones, Michael Davis had a great pass breakup against Brown, who appeared to get separation for a split second. Davis undercut the route and knocked it away, earning vociferous praise from assistant defensive backs coach (and longtime Steelers cornerback) William Gay.Kyu Blu Kelly also had a good pass breakup, playing through the ball and knocking it out as Luke McCaffrey tried to finish the catch.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

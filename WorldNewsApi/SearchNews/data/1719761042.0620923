She\u2019s already shared the LP\u2019s \u201cKravitz\u201d and \u201cPantalla azul,\u201d and, now, she\u2019s released the music video for the single \u201cEnfrente.\u201d The video, directed by Jos\u00e9 Ostos and Ana Drucker, features Fratti, Edwin Mensah, and Timi Adisa. Watch it below. \u201cThe starting point was water, we were interested in its movement and plasticity,\u201d Ostos and Drucker explained of their visual in a press statement. \u201cWe also wanted the images to work as a rhythmic accompaniment to the song\u2019s groove. After some testing, we established a system that enabled us to film diverse subjects through distortions and reflections created by the dynamic interaction of light and water. We focused on this technique to create a series of scenes and images with an internal rhythm and a chromatic palette that blended with the textures and colors of Mabe\u2019s song.\u201d Fratti is playing a number of shows in support of her Se Ve Desde Aqu\u00ed follow-up. See her schedule, which includes performances as part of Pitchfork Music Festivals London and Paris, below.

In a video posted from the episode on Instagram, Stanbury said, \u201cAfter 40, we all know, it\u2019s very, very hard to lose weight. But I met so many 40-year-old women going, \u2018How have you done it?\u2019 And I don\u2019t want to lie to you \u2026 I used Ozempic, which I think is one of the best tools if you\u2019re able to use it.\u201d \u201cWhat did Kate Moss say? \u2018Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\u2019 There\u2019s something to be said for that,\u201d added Stanbury. Ozempic is a type 2 diabetes prescription drug used popularly for weight loss in Hollywood. The medication is a brand name for semaglutide, found also in the clinical obesity drug Wegovy, which is a GLP-1 receptor that helps reduce appetite. Speaking about their nutrition balance outside of these aids, Stanbury\u2019s husband Sergio Carrallo explained on the podcast, \u201cWe try to maintain the balance \u2026 if we have a big dinner we try to just fast a little bit until breakfast.\u201d He then told Standbury, \u201cFrom a professional background in sports, I think you\u2019ve found your balance now.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Carrallo said it was \u201cone of the hardest moments of my life\u201d in the footage as his wife was seen barely able to move at home and resting in bed following the surgery. \u201cSeeing the person that you love with all your heart suffering and in pain how she was \u2026it was very hard,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cAs a husband, I will always support her and be here for her and as much as I was against it, she really wanted to do it. So, I was there for her, supporting and helping her day to day.\" Stanbury appears on season 2 of RHOD, which premieres Sunday, June 2 at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.

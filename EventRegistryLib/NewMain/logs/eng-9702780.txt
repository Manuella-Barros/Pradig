Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Biden bestows Medal of Honor on Union soldiers who helped hijack train in Confederate territory\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

These men, part of a Union Army contingent that stole a Confederate train, were not recognized until now.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday will award the Medal of Honor posthumously to two U.S. Army privates who were part of a daring Union Army contingent that stole a Confederate train during the Civil War, the White House said.\n\nPhilip Shadrach and George Wilson, will receive the medals during a White House ceremony that will recognize their \"gallantry and intrepidity\" during what become known as the Great Locomotive Chase, one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history, the White House said. The operation, which took place 200 miles (322 km) behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862, saw Union Soldiers dressed as civilians hijack a train in Georgia and drive it north into Tennessee for 87 miles, placing explosives on the track behind them as they headed north to destroy Confederate infrastructure.\n\nSix of those participants became the Army's first recipients of the then-newly created Medal of Honor. Over the next two decades, another 13 members were recognized for their role in mission, but Shadrach and Wilson, who were both hanged for their actions after being captured, were never recognized until now. The White House ceremony offers Biden a brief respite from mounting criticism from some of his fellow Democrats after his shaky and halting performance in last week's presidential debate against Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe mission saw 24 men infiltrate the South in small groups, rendezvousing north of Atlanta at Marietta, Georgia. On the day the operation was executed, 22 of the men commandeered a locomotive known as \"The General\" and proceeded north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went. Shadrach, a native Pennsylvanian orphaned at an early age, was only 21 years old when he volunteered for the dangerous mission. Wilson, born in Ohio, was a journeyman shoemaker who enlisted in the Union Army in August 1861.\n\nThe White House said it was not clear why Shadrach and Wilson were not originally recommended for the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed forces who show great personal bravery or self-sacrifice and distinguish themselves at the risk of their own lives while engaged in military actions.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marietta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marietta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_14_7140931.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 888, "textEnd": 896}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden will award the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry on Wednesday to two Union soldiers who stole a locomotive deep in Confederate territory during the Civil War and drove it north for 87 miles (140 kilometers) as they destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines.\n\nU.S. Army Pvts. Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden is recognizing their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration.\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

The soldiers, U.S. Army Privates Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson, seized a locomotive and traveled 87 miles north while disrupting enemy infrastructure.\n\nDespite being captured by Confederate forces and subsequently hanged, Biden is posthumously awarding them the prestigious Medal of Honor, acknowledging their bravery over a century and a half later.\n\nThis recognition of Shadrach and Wilson's heroism comes against the backdrop of the enduring impact of the Civil War on American history. With the nation still grappling with the aftermath of a conflict that claimed the lives of over 600,000 soldiers from both the Union and the Confederacy, the political landscape in the U.S. remains influenced by issues related to race, constitutional liberties, and the extent of presidential authority, particularly as the country navigates a divisive election year.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as \"the Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called \"Andrews' Raiders\" met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named \"The General.\" The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor award ever bestowed went to Private Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nBorn on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, Shadrach was just 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking entitled \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" that starred Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden on Wednesday awarded the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry to two Union soldiers who stole a locomotive deep in Confederate territory during the Civil War and drove it north for 87 miles (140 kilometers) as they destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines.\n\nU.S. Army Pvts. Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nBorn on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, Shadrach was just 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday awarded the Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry to two Union soldiers who stole a locomotive deep in Confederate territory during the Civil War and drove it north for 87 miles (140 kilometers) as they destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines.\n\nU.S. Army Pvts. Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden is recognizing their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration.\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riff ed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-greatgreat-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded.\n\nThey were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohiobased volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Deere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Falls,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Gettysburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nHistoric World War II aircraft to fly into Valparaiso $80 million Palace Theatre redevelopment billed as biggest investment in downtown Gary in 50 years UPDATE: Valpo man, woman identified as deceased in Valpo-area motorcycle crash John Deere closes on land for 1.2 million-square-foot warehouse that will be longer than the Sears Tower lying on its side NWI Business Ins and Outs: Chicago's best seafood winner Lowcountry, Little Italy, Dirty Dogs, Al Salam Market and Chipotle opening; House of India and Rockablock close The Original Rainbow Cone Ice Cream Shop coming to Dyer, Flossmoor and New Buffalo Child found riding bike alone in Valpo while mom passed out at home, cops say New stores open at Lighthouse Place Premium Outlets Man pleads guilty to murder in brutal Valpo health club stabbing Fallen soldier returned to Region Major road project begins in Winfield Seven injured, homes and cars damaged by errant fireworks in Griffith Walgreens planning to close many locations New details say truck was not slowing at time of fatal crash, Porter County cops say Hammond superintendent appointed McDermott's chief of staff\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded.\n\nThey were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\" \"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohiobased volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLean_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "McLean County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McLean County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartland_Community_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heartland Community College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gallows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Gettysburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports Birth of West Virginia The First Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Shiloh The Seven Days Battles From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft The Confederacy splits in two The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Jefferson Davis is finally captured; the last Confederate troops lay down arms 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susan_walsh@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Susan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Waterloo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Deere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedar_Falls,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cedar Falls, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George S.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Gunfire at Fort Sumter Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports Birth of West Virginia The 'Border States' refuse the Confederacy but not slavery The First Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Shiloh The Peninsula Campaign The Seven Days Battles From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft The Battle of Gettysburg The Confederacy splits in two Union victories in Tennessee Grant's Wilderness Campaign The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts The Confederacy falls Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Jefferson Davis is finally captured; the last Confederate troops lay down arms Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susan_walsh@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Susan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Of the 40 million who have served in the Armed Forces since the Civil War, only roughly 3,500 have earned it.\n\nThe ceremony will take place on the eve of the nation's Independence Day.\n\nShadrach and Wilson will receive their Medals of Honor more than 160 years after they were executed by the Confederacy for their role in what's known as the ill-fated Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nThe two soldiers were part of Andrews' Raiders -- an infamous group of two civilians and several infantrymen -- who in April 1862 donned civilian clothes and stole a Confederate locomotive near Kennesaw, Georgia.\n\nThe Raiders fled northward toward Chattanooga, ripping up railroad tracks and destroying telegraph lines and bridges to disrupt communications in the rebel areas of the South. However, the train ran out of fuel near Ringgold, Georgia.\n\nThey abandoned the locomotive, fleeing into the countryside, but were soon captured by Confederate troops.\n\nConfederate soldiers took the Raiders, including Shadrach and Wilson, to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they were convicted of \"bridge burning.\" They were then moved to Atlanta where seven of the Raiders, including civilian scout James Andrews along with Shadrach and Wilson, were hanged in June 1862.\n\nAnother eight Raiders escaped the Atlanta jail and, in March 1863, the remaining six were exchanged in a prisoner swap.\n\nThe six who were exchanged as prisoners were the first Medal of Honor recipients in the nation's history.\n\nIn all, between 1863 and 1884, 19 Raiders were Medal of Honor recipients. A medal was offered to another soldier, who declined to accept it because he'd been stopped by Confederate troops and never made it to Georgia.\n\nThe White House said it was unclear why Shadrach and Wilson were not originally recommended for the Medal of Honor, noting both met all of the qualifications to be honored.\n\nIn January 2008, President George W. Bush signed legislation authorizing the United States to award the Medal of Honor to Shadrach and Wilson.\n\nHowever, it took more than 16 years and three administrations for the two soldiers to receive their honor.

Mike Rounds\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports Birth of West Virginia The First Battle of Bull Run From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft Union victories in Tennessee Grant's Wilderness Campaign The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts The Confederacy falls Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Jefferson Davis is finally captured; the last Confederate troops lay down arms Gunfire at Fort Sumter Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection The 'Border States' refuse the Confederacy but not slavery The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Shiloh The Peninsula Campaign The Seven Days Battles The Battle of Gettysburg The Confederacy splits in two 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "susan_walsh@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Susan Walsh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCook_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "McCook Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cherokee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanborn_County,_South_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanborn County, South Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sanborn County, South Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nAssociated Press writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Gunfire at Fort Sumter Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports Birth of West Virginia The 'Border States' refuse the Confederacy but not slavery The First Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Shiloh The Peninsula Campaign The Seven Days Battles From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft The Confederacy splits in two Union victories in Tennessee Grant's Wilderness Campaign The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Jefferson Davis is finally captured; the last Confederate troops lay down arms The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Gettysburg The Confederacy falls Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Over the next two decades, another 13 members were recognized for their role in mission, but Shadrach and Wilson, who were both hanged for their actions after being captured, were never recognized until now.\n\nThe White House ceremony offers Biden a brief respite from mounting criticism from some of his fellow Democrats after his shaky and halting performance in last week's presidential debate against Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe mission saw 24 men infiltrate the South in small groups, rendezvousing north of Atlanta at Marietta, Georgia. On the day the operation was executed, 22 of the men commandeered a locomotive known as \"The General\" and proceeded north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went.\n\nShadrach, a native Pennsylvanian orphaned at an early age, was only 21 years old when he volunteered for the dangerous mission. Wilson, born in Ohio, was a journeyman shoemaker who enlisted in the Union Army in August 1861.\n\nThe White House said it was not clear why Shadrach and Wilson were not originally recommended for the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed forces who show great personal bravery or self-sacrifice and distinguish themselves at the risk of their own lives while engaged in military actions.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors":

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging.

Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson posthumously\n\nOn April 12, 1862, a group of Union soldiers from Ohio regiments stole a locomotive in Georgia and rode it north, destroying track and telegraph lines in their wake.\n\nThe plan, masterminded by Kentucky civilian scout James J. Andrews, was to cut off Chattanooga, Tenn. from the Confederacy by destroying the railroad tracks, bridges and telegraph lines that connected the city to Atlanta. Twenty-two Union soldiers from Ohio regiments and another civilian joined the plot, which involved sneaking into the South wearing civilian clothes.\n\nOn March 25, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's war secretary bestowed Andrews' Raiders with the country's first Medals of Honor. In the years since, all but two soldiers involved in the raid have received the nation's highest military decoration for their bravery.\n\n\"Privates (Philip G.) Shadrach and (George D.) Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to protect the Union, but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each deserved,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will fix the 161-year-old oversight by honoring Private Philip G. Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson posthumously.\n\nThe Great Locomotive Chase\n\nShadrach was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 1840, to Robert and Elizabeth Shadrach, and became an orphan at an early age. Shadrach enlisted in the 2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1861 and volunteered for the dangerous mission at age 21.\n\n\"Like many other young volunteer soldiers, Private Shadrach was willing to encounter both peril and hardship to fight for what he believed in,\" according to a White House news release.\n\nWilson was born in Belmont County, Ohio, in 1830 to George and Elizabeth Wilson. Originally a craftsman, Wilson volunteered for the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1861 and joined Andrews' Raiders shortly after.\n\nOnce Shadrach, Wilson and the others arrived in Georgia, they commandeered a locomotive called \"The General\" and its three boxcars. They stole the train while the crew and passengers were eating breakfast at the Lacy Hotel in Big Shanty, Georgia. The train's conductor chased them, first on foot and later by handcar for 87 miles, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nThe pursuit continued for until about 18 miles from Chattanooga, where the Union soldiers abandoned the \"General\" and fled. They were caught and eight men were later executed by hanging, including Andrews, Shadrach and Wilson.\n\nOne of the raiders wrote about the operation and in 1956, Walt Disney Productions released a film about the event called \"The Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nIn 2007, former U.S. Rep. Dave Hobson, R-Springfield, introduced legislation to correct the omission of Shadrach and Wilson's medals. A constituent from Amanda brought the issue to his attention. The following year, Congress authorized honoring the men - but it never happened.\n\n\"These gentlemen were left out. They performed the same heroic acts,\" Hobson said in an interview. \"I thought this is not right. We're going to try to fix this.

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as \"the Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called \"Andrews' Raiders\" met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named \"The General.\" The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor award ever bestowed went to Private Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nBorn on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, Shadrach was just 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking entitled \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" that starred Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General\" starring Buster Keaton was also based on the historic event.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will receive the honor for their gallantry and intrepidity while participating in a covert military operation 200 miles behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862, which became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nIn what was one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history, Union soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy and hijacked the General Locomotive in Georgia before proceeding north.\n\nLAST SURVIVING MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT FROM THE KOREAN WAR LIES IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL\n\nThe goal of the operation was to destroy the Western and Atlantic Railroad between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and help bring about the end of the Civil War. They were pursued by Confederate forces on foot, and then later on by a succession of locomotives, including The Texas.\n\nAlthough the raiders caused a lot of damage, they were unable to burn bridges or damage Tunnel Hill and the train stopped 18 miles from Chattanooga after the wood they had hoped to burn was soaked by rain resulting in the locomotive running out of fuel.\n\nThe plan for the Great Locomotive Chase was hatched by James J. Andrews - a Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout. Andrews and 23 other men, including Shadrach and Wilson, later became known as the Andrews' Raiders and infiltrated the South in small groups, rendezvousing north of Atlanta at Marietta, Georgia.\n\nSix of the Union participants became the Army's first recipients of the newly created Medal of Honor. It is unknown why Private Shadrach and Private Wilson were not originally recommended for the award. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor, and it has been awarded to more than 3,500 people.\n\nCOL. RALPH PUCKETT, KOREAN WAR HERO AND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT, DEAD AT 97\n\nAccording to the White House, both were deserving in 1863 and will be posthumously awarded later today. The first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nShadrach, a native Pennsylvanian and Union Army Soldier, and Wilson, a soldier from Belmont County, Ohio, were eventually captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden is recognizing their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration.\n\nShadrach, who was left orphaned at an early age, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the dangerous mission. He left home in 1861 and enlisted in the Ohio Infantry's 2nd Regiment.\n\nWilson was originally a tradesman who supported his family as a journeyman shoemaker. He enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth The General and The Texas survived the war and have been preserved in museums.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden is recognizing their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration.\n\nThe posthumous recognition comes as the legacy of the Civil War, which killed more than 600,000 Union and Confederate service members between 1861 and 1865, continues to shape U.S. politics in a contentious election year in which issues of race, constitutional rights and presidential power are at the forefront.\n\nBiden, a Democrat, has said that the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump was the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War. Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of the slavery and the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Patel to reopen Rose Hill as business after estate fails to find new owner in foreclosure sale 'Looking forward to it:' Aiken residents make voices heard on Powderhouse Connector Fermata Club members vote to sell to private developers Aiken to hold Powderhouse Connector meeting July 2 Arrest made in May shooting on Aiken's Southside Savannah River National Lab-led project receives nearly $10 million in federal funding Angela Moore named principal of Aiken High School for the upcoming school year Tropical Smoothie Cafe opens in Aiken Towne Park Aiken business won't reopen after fire earlier this year Thurston Williams named principal of New Ellenton Middle Steam Magnet School\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson, members of the Union Army's 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, will receive the Medal of Honor on their behalf during a White House ceremony led by President Biden.\n\nThe event closes a decades-long campaign by the men's families to rectify what they and many historians came to see as an unjust oversight in recognizing everyone involved in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nShadrach and Wilson were among a group of 24 who carried out the brazen plan in April 1862, commandeering a train outside Atlanta and blazing an 87-mile path of destruction north through Georgia to the Tennessee line with adversaries in hot pursuit. When the chase finally ended, the raiders were captured, and eight were put to death. Most escaped, though several were held as prisoners of war for nearly a year.\n\nNineteen soldiers received the Medal of Honor -- including the first ever awarded -- for their role in the mission. (Several of them were recognized posthumously.) Another soldier, captured before the raid began, later refused the award, historians said. Two others involved were civilians and did not rate it.\n\nIn an emotional discussion with reporters on Tuesday, Shadrach's and Wilson's descendants swelled with pride knowing that the efforts of their ancestors and their families' grass-roots lobbying effort, alongside historians, will at last be recognized.\n\nSome who made the trip to Washington were acquainted with the story long ago. Others, including Wilson's great-great-granddaughter Theresa Chandler, learned from the Army only four years ago that her lineage included a prominent Civil War figure.\n\nNow 85, she said it has reshaped a legacy nearly lost to history.\n\n\"I would have given anything,\" she said, \"to be able to say, 'Grandpa, tell me about it. ... What was it like?'\"\n\nThe mission was born from a desire to destroy the South's ability to move troops and military equipment.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel, assigned by the Union to its Tennessee campaign, mulled how to best attack Chattanooga, a well-defended Confederate citadel located along vital water and rail lines. If invaded head on, the rebels could flood the area with reinforcements on train cars from the south and overwhelm U.S. forces, he concluded.\n\nJames J. Andrews, a civilian spy for the North, crafted a novel solution. A small team of volunteers would travel 200 miles into Confederate territory dressed as civilians, steal a train engine, and then destroy tracks and burn bridges to strangle the secessionists' logistical lines.\n\nThe plan faced setbacks from the start, said Shane Makowicki, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military History. It had rained ahead of the mission, making it difficult to ignite the bridges. The soldiers lacked tools and had to improvise, he said. And while some had experience with trains, there were little if any preparations undertaken beforehand.\n\n\"That speaks to the courage and heroism of these men that they volunteered for this,\" Makowicki said. \"Today, if we were going to send people to do this, you have months or weeks of specialized training.\"\n\nThe mission, lead by Andrews, began north of Atlanta in present day Kennesaw, Ga., where the team seized a locomotive named the General and its three boxcars. The conductor, William Fuller, gathered a party and gave chase on foot before taking over a hand car and eventually several other locomotives to catch up with the Union soldiers.\n\nThe raid party made periodic stops to tear out track ties and sever telegraph cables in a bid to prevent other Confederate troops from learning about the raid. Oncoming trains on the single track forced the General to stop several times, according to an Army summary of the mission.\n\nAs Fuller and his party closed in, the Union raiders aboard the General, low on wood to feed the engine, abandoned the locomotive 18 miles short of Chattanooga, the Army said. The men scattered, but all were eventually captured within two weeks.\n\nChattanooga fell the next year.\n\nAndrews and seven others, including Shadrach and Wilson, were tried as spies and saboteurs and hanged. Jacob Parrott, who was severely beaten in captivity, was among those who survived the ordeal and later made history as the first service member to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nHistorians and family members could only speculate why Shadrach and Wilson were overlooked for so long. The unit was involved in heavy fighting afterward, and officers who would have kept track of such accomplishments were pushed to other units, said Brad Quinlin, a historian and author involved in advocating for the men's Medals of Honor.\n\nSome members of the Shadrach family had pushed for the recognition since the Carter administration, they said. A 2008 spending bill included a provision to award the medal to the two men, but momentum did not pick up until 2012, when Quinlin and family member Ron Shadrach met. They later submitted fresh evidence for defense officials to review.\n\nAlthough the mission ultimately failed, it is remembered as a prominent moment of the Civil War and has yielded books and films, including Buster Keaton's \"The General\" in 1926 and \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" in 1956.\n\nBrian Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-great-nephew, said delving into family history left him in awe, and doing so with his father deepened their relationship. They lovingly call Shadrach \"Uncle Stealer,\" and Taylor once climbed aboard the General, now a museum piece in Georgia.\n\nAhead of the White House ceremony, Taylor strummed an acoustic guitar and crooned a song he wrote about the mission. \"Do it for the glory, boys,\" he sang, \"because you may not find your way back home tonight.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_horton@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Alex Horton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach_(Beastie_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormsby_M._Mitchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ormsby M.

He was a tradesman who supported his family as a journeyman shoemaker, according to the Army. Wilson enlisted in the Union Army's 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment on Aug. 31, 1861.\n\nPhilip Shadrach enlisted into the same regiment the following month. He was born in Somerset County, Pa., in 1840, and left orphaned at an early age. Less is known of Shadrach's work, other than he was a \"laborer.\" But on Sept. 20, 1861, he left home and enlisted, according to the service.\n\nThe two men eventually volunteered for the same mission and experienced the same fate.\n\nPvts. Wilson and Shadrach will be awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously Wednesday, becoming the last members of a unit known as Andrews' Raiders to be recognized with the nation's highest decoration for combat valor.\n\nIn one of the earliest special operations in Army history, Union soldiers dressed as civilians to infiltrate the Confederacy, hijack a train and drive it north for 87 miles, destroying enemy infrastructure along the way. During what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase, six of the Union soldiers became the Army's first recipients of the newly created Medal of Honor, according to the service.\n\nThe plan for the Great Locomotive Chase was hatched by James Andrews, a Kentucky-born civilian who served as a spy and scout. He proposed a group of volunteers penetrate the Confederacy with the aim of degrading the railway and communication lines that supported the South's stronghold of Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nAndrews, another civilian and 22 volunteer Union soldiers, who later became known as Andrews' Raiders, made their rendezvous point in Marietta, Ga.\n\nShane Makowicki, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military History, said the plan was hatched April 6, 1862. Wilson, Shadrach and the other soldiers volunteered one day later. They made it to Marietta on April 11.\n\nOn April 12, 22 of them commandeered a locomotive known as the General and proceeded north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went along. The General's conductor, William Fuller, and two others began chasing the raiders -- first on foot, then by a handcar, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nAndrews' efforts driving the General were slowed by their sabotage efforts and because he needed to permit oncoming trains to pass on the single-track railway. This allowed Fuller's party to gain on the Union force. Running low on fuel and with the Texas, a locomotive commandeered by Fuller, on their heels, Andrews' Raiders abandoned their effort just 18 miles short of Chattanooga.\n\nAfter it became clear the mission failed, Shadrach and Wilson along with several others attempted to evade Confederate troops and escape. Some including Shadrach and Wilson were eventually captured.\n\n\"The event, if it would have been successful and cut off Chattanooga from Confederate supplies, it could have shortened the war by a year, year and half, two years,\" author and historian Brad Quinlin told reporters Tuesday.\n\nAndrews was tried as a spy and saboteur and executed on June 7, 1862. Seven others were subsequently hanged, including Shadrach and Wilson, on June 18.\n\nNineteen of the 22 Union soldiers received the Medal of Honor. One soldier was offered the medal but declined as he did not fully participate. Former President George W. Bush signed the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act that included a measure to allow him to award Wilson and Shadrach with the medal. But Bush never did.\n\n\"The Civil War Medal of Honor is ancient history. Things moved in relevant and more current directions,\" Ron Shadrach, a great cousin of Shadrach, said Tuesday.\n\nMakowicki said it is important to remember the Medal of Honor at the time of the Civil War was a new award.\n\n\"Today we might think everybody on the mission would have good documentation and every soldier who participated would be awarded the medal just the same,\" he said. \"You often needed someone to advocate on your behalf if your officers had left the regiment. It was a bit more of an ad hoc process, so it really does appear to be by all accounts more of an oversight than certainly any comment on their behavior.\"\n\nRon Shadrach, 67, from Independence, Ohio, remembers seeing a plaque his aunt showed him as a little kid that had the Shadrach name on it but didn't know what it was about. In 2003, he saw a newspaper article pulling for Wilson and Shadrach to get the Medal of Honor.\n\n\"That started to connect the dots. Anytime I brought it up over the years my dad would say the same thing, 'It's something that happened down South and we're totally not related,'\" Shadrach said.\n\nOnce he learned of the relation, Shadrach started to work on getting the Medal of Honor for both men. He started compiling the information in 2012 and connected with Brad Quinlin.\n\nShadrach had a binder of information that he submitted in February 2016 to Gen. Mark Milley who was the Army Chief of Staff at the time. The binder includes drawings of Wilson and Shadrach before being executed by hanging. There were photos of letters that the private's youngest sister wrote for 20 years trying to get back pay and any rations that Shadrach was eligible for while in a Confederate prison.\n\n\"I didn't have much patience with the government for these delays. It's like, 'This makes no sense,'\" Shadrach said. \"If not for that delay, I wouldn't have had time to put this document together. It wouldn't have uncovered all this information. It's like a blessing in disguise.\"\n\nScott Chandler, 61, from Fredericktown, Ohio, said he got into this story back in 2020 when there was talk about Wilson receiving the Medal of Honor. But his family didn't have much knowledge of Wilson.\n\n\"I just had the thought -- My mom's [older than] 80, her sisters aren't far behind her in age so I started pushing for it because I wanted to see her be able to accept it,\" Chandler said.\n\nHe heard the award was on the president's desk so there wasn't much he could do. During that time, Chandler started doing his own research. He used some information that his mother had and was sharing some with his sister, Kimberly, 59, who lives in Walla Walla, Wash., with her family.\n\nIn accounts about Wilson, he was fighting to help keep the Union together and it appeared he wanted slavery abolished. There is a drawing that depicts Wilson and the men being hung. He gave a final statement, saying he had \"no ill-will toward the South\" and ended it by saying \"one day the Union flag will fly over your states again,\" according to Chandler.\n\nChandler said his mother and her two sisters will keep Wilson's Medal of Honor for a while but will donate it afterward to the National Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga, Tenn. The medal will be displayed in the same city where Wilson is buried at the Chattanooga National Cemetery.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_adams@stripes.com", "name": "Matthew Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach_(Beastie_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson were captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden recognized their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration, calling the operation they joined \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two. Two soldiers who died because of that operation and never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Gunfire at Fort Sumter Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports Birth of West Virginia The 'Border States' refuse the Confederacy but not slavery The First Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Shiloh The Seven Days Battles From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft The Battle of Gettysburg The Confederacy splits in two Union victories in Tennessee Grant's Wilderness Campaign The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts The Confederacy falls Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Jefferson Davis is finally captured; the last Confederate troops lay down arms The Peninsula Campaign Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Six members of the group, made up of 22 soldiers and two civilians, were awarded the very first Medals of Honor in the nation's history on March 25, 1863. Over the next two decades, another 13 members were recognized for their role in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase, per WTVC. A century and a half later, George Wilson and Philip Shadrach, both hanged for their actions, will be the 20th and 21st to receive the medal after a campaign led by the Shadrach family and historian and author Brad Quinlin.\n\nAll 24 men left Shelbyville, Tennessee, in early April 1862, bound for Marietta, Georgia, where they planned to steal the Confederate Army's General train and destroy the rail line between Atlanta and Chattanooga. Just 22 made it to Marietta and two overslept the following morning so that only 20 boarded the train on April 12, 1862, per WTVC. They seized control of the locomotive near Kennesaw, then rode the train northward toward Chattanooga, \"doing as much damage as possible to the vital Western and Atlantic Railroad line as they went,\" according to the Medal of Honor Heritage Center. The mission \"was extremely important for the morale of the north,\" retired Army Gen. BB Bell tells WTVC, noting \"enlistments skyrocketed\" in the aftermath.\n\nThe 22 men who reached Marietta were eventually captured after the train was abandoned north of Ringgold. Wilson and Shadrach were among eight to be court-martialed as spies and hanged. \"Wilson was considered the most remarkable man of the whole group,\" per WKRC. \"He spoke before he was hanged saying he had no hard feelings for the southerners,\" whom he claimed were deceived by their leaders and would come to regret the rebellion against the United States. It's unclear why Wilson and Shadrach weren't recognized previously. Even a Raiders member who was stopped by Confederates before reaching Georgia was offered a Medal of Honor, though he declined it, per WTVC. The medals will be posthumously awarded Wednesday at the White House.

Paris Davis received the top military award for his Vietnam service. Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the details.\n\nPresident Biden will on Wednesday posthumously award the Medal of Honor to two Union soldiers who pirated a locomotive deep in Confederate territory during the Civil War and then drove it 87 miles north, destroying railroad tracks and telegraph lines along the way.\n\nPrivate Philip G. Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will receive the honor for their gallantry and intrepidity while participating in a covert military operation 200 miles behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862, which became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nIn what was one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history, Union soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy and hijacked the General Locomotive in Georgia before proceeding north.\n\nLAST SURVIVING MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT FROM THE KOREAN WAR LIES IN HONOR AT US CAPITOL\n\nThe goal of the operation was to destroy the Western and Atlantic Railroad between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and help bring about the end of the Civil War. They were pursued by Confederate forces on foot, and then later on by a succession of locomotives, including The Texas.\n\nAlthough the raiders caused a lot of damage, they were unable to burn bridges or damage Tunnel Hill and the train stopped 18 miles from Chattanooga after the wood they had hoped to burn was soaked by rain resulting in the locomotive running out of fuel.\n\nThe plan for the Great Locomotive Chase was hatched by James J. Andrews - a Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout. Andrews and 23 other men, including Shadrach and Wilson, later became known as the Andrews' Raiders and infiltrated the South in small groups, rendezvousing north of Atlanta at Marietta, Georgia.\n\nSix of the Union participants became the Army's first recipients of the newly created Medal of Honor. It is unknown why Private Shadrach and Private Wilson were not originally recommended for the award. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor, and it has been awarded to more than 3,500 people.\n\nCOL. RALPH PUCKETT, KOREAN WAR HERO AND MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT, DEAD AT 97\n\nAccording to the White House, both were deserving in 1863 and will be posthumously awarded later today. The first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nShadrach, a native Pennsylvanian and Union Army Soldier, and Wilson, a soldier from Belmont County, Ohio, were eventually captured by Confederates and executed by hanging. Biden is recognizing their courage 162 years later with the country's highest military decoration.\n\nShadrach, who was left orphaned at an early age, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the dangerous mission. He left home in 1861 and enlisted in the Ohio Infantry's 2nd Regiment.\n\nWilson was originally a tradesman who supported his family as a journeyman shoemaker. He enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoth The General and The Texas survived the war and have been preserved in museums. The General is located at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History, in Kennesaw, Georgia, while The Texas is at the Atlanta History Center.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter.

Over the next two decades, another 13 members were recognized for their role in mission, but Shadrach and Wilson, who were both hanged for their actions after being captured, were never recognized until now.\n\nThe White House ceremony offers Biden a brief respite from mounting criticism from some of his fellow Democrats after his shaky and halting performance in last week's presidential debate against Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe mission saw 24 men infiltrate the South in small groups, rendezvousing north of Atlanta at Marietta, Georgia. On the day the operation was executed, 22 of the men commandeered a locomotive known as \"The General\" and proceeded north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went.\n\nShadrach, a native Pennsylvanian orphaned at an early age, was only 21 years old when he volunteered for the dangerous mission. Wilson, born in Ohio, was a journeyman shoemaker who enlisted in the Union Army in August 1861.\n\nThe White House said it was not clear why Shadrach and Wilson were not originally recommended for the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the armed forces who show great personal bravery or self-sacrifice and distinguish themselves at the risk of their own lives while engaged in military actions.\n\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Christian Schmollinger", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, riffed at a recent Pennsylvania rally about the Battle of Gettysburg and about the Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded.\n\nThey were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohiobased volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Crosse,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "La Crosse, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onalaska,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Onalaska, Wisconsin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winona, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winona, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Gettysburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Lee.\n\nThe president said Wednesday that Shadrach and Wilson were \"fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon: freedom, justice, fairness, unity.\"\n\n\"Phillip and George were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real,\" Biden said.\n\nTheresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, recalled for The Associated Press how the Union soldier had the noose around his neck on the gallows and spoke his final words.\n\nShe said that Wilson essentially said that he was there to serve his country and had no ill feelings for the people of the South, but that he hoped for the abolition of slavery and for the nation to be united again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" Chandler said. \"We can feel that as a family and that we're enjoying our freedoms today, what he tried to move forward at the time.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBrian Taylor, a great-great-great-nephew of Shadrach, said this was an opportunity for his ancestor to be remembered as \"a brave soldier who did what he thought was right.\"\n\n\"I kind of feel that he was a bit adventurous, a bit of a free spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nA Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout named James J. Andrews put together a group of volunteers, including Shadrach and Wilson, to degrade the railway and telegraph lines used by Confederates in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nOn April 12, 1862, 22 of the men in what was later called Andrews' Raiders met up in Marietta, Georgia, and hijacked a train named The General. The group tore up tracks and sliced through telegraph wires while taking the train north.\n\nConfederate troops chased them, initially on foot and later by train. The Confederate troops eventually caught the group. Andrews and seven others were executed, while the others either escaped or remained prisoners of war.\n\nThe first Medal of Honor ever bestowed went to Pvt. Jacob Parrott, who participated in the locomotive hijacking and was beaten while imprisoned by the Confederacy.\n\nThe government later recognized 18 other participants who took part in the raid with the honor, but Shadrach and Wilson were excluded. They were later authorized to receive the medal as part of the fiscal 2008 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nShadrach, born on Sept. 15, 1840, in Pennsylvania, was 21 years old when he volunteered for the mission. He was orphaned at a young age and left home in 1861 to enlist in an Ohio infantry regiment after the start of the Civil War.\n\nWilson was born in 1830 in Belmont County, Ohio. He worked as a journeyman shoemaker before the war and enlisted in an Ohio-based volunteer infantry in 1861.\n\nThe Walt Disney Corp. made a 1956 movie about the hijacking titled \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" starring Fess Parker and Jeffrey Hunter. The 1926 silent film \"The General,\" starring Buster Keaton, was also based on the historic event.\n\nA timeline of the Civil War A timeline of the Civil War Lincoln calls in troops to contain the insurrection Four more states join the Confederacy Blockade of Southern ports The 'Border States' refuse the Confederacy but not slavery The First Battle of Bull Run The Battle of Fort Royal The Battle of Shiloh The Peninsula Campaign From the Second Battle of Bull Run to the Battle of Fredericksburg Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation The Conscription Act of 1863 establishes a national draft The Battle of Gettysburg The Confederacy splits in two Union victories in Tennessee Grant's Wilderness Campaign The capture of Atlanta Lincoln is reelected Submittal of the Forts The Confederacy falls Surrender of the South The assassination of President Lincoln Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Andrews, was to cut off Chattanooga, Tennessee, from the Confederacy by destroying the railroad tracks, bridges and telegraph lines that connected the city to Atlanta. Twenty-two Union soldiers from Ohio regiments and another civilian joined the plot, which involved sneaking into the South wearing civilian clothes.\n\nOn March 25, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's war secretary bestowed the group that became known as Andrews' Raiders with the country's first Medals of Honor. In the years since, all but two soldiers involved in the raid have received the nation's highest military decoration for their bravery.\n\n\"Privates (Philip G.) Shadrach and (George D.) Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to protect the Union, but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each deserved,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will fix the 161-year-old oversight by posthumously honoring Shadrach and Wilson, who were hanged for the heist.\n\nThe Great Locomotive Chase\n\nShadrach was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 15, 1840, to Robert and Elizabeth Shadrach, and became an orphan at an early age. Shadrach enlisted in the 2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1861 and volunteered for the dangerous mission at age 21.\n\n\"Like many other young volunteer soldiers, Private Shadrach was willing to encounter both peril and hardship to fight for what he believed in,\" according to a White House news release.\n\nWilson was born in Belmont County, Ohio, in 1830 to George and Elizabeth Wilson. Originally a craftsman, Wilson volunteered for the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1861 and joined Andrews' Raiders shortly after.\n\nOnce Shadrach, Wilson and the others arrived in Georgia, they commandeered a locomotive called \"The General\" and its three boxcars. They stole the train while the crew and passengers were eating breakfast at the Lacy Hotel in Big Shanty, Georgia. The train's conductor chased them, first on foot and later by handcar for 87 miles, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nThe pursuit continued for until about 18 miles from Chattanooga, where the Union soldiers abandoned the \"General\" and fled. They were caught, and eight men were later executed by hanging, including Andrews, Shadrach and Wilson.\n\nOne of the Raiders wrote about the operation and in 1956, Walt Disney Productions released a film about the event called \"The Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nIn 2007, former Ohio Rep. Dave Hobson introduced legislation to correct the omission of Shadrach and Wilson's medals after a constituent brought the issue to his attention. The following year, Congress authorized honoring the men - but it never happened.\n\n\"These gentlemen were left out. They performed the same heroic acts,\" Hobson said in an interview. \"I thought this is not right. We're going to try to fix this. Finally, we're getting it fixed in my lifetime.\"\n\nBogged down in bureaucracy, the honor was never bestowed.

He proposed penetrating the Confederacy with the goal of degrading their railway and communications lines to cut off Chattanooga, Tennessee, from Confederate supplies and reinforcements.\n\nAndrews, together with 23 other men, infiltrated the South in small groups, coming together north of Atlanta. On April 12, 1862, 22 of the men commandeered a locomotive called The General and ventured north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went. The men became known as the Andrews' Raiders.\n\nShadrach, originally from Pennsylvania and orphaned at a young age, was just 21 when he volunteered for the mission. On Sept. 20, 1861, he left home and enlisted in a Union Army Ohio Infantry Regiment.

He also volunteered for the Andrews' Raid.\n\nAfter the operation, both men were captured, convicted as spies and hanged.\n\n\"It is unknown why Private Shadrach and Private Wilson were not originally recommended for the Medal of Honor,\" a White House official said. \"Both were deserving in 1863, and on July 3, 2024, by order of the President of the United States both will be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.\"\n\nThe ceremony comes as questions mount over Mr. Biden's future as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, with his public appearances under intense scrutiny following his halting performance at last week's presidential debate.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for their gallantry and intrepidity while participating in a covert military operation 200 miles behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862,\" a White House official said. \"In one of the earliest special operations in US Army history, Union Soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy, hijacked a train in Georgia and drove it north for 87 miles, destroying enemy infrastructure along the way.\"\n\nBiden will award the medals in a ceremony at the White House with descendants of Shadrach and Wilson expected to attend.\n\nThe pair were members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 when they joined 20 other Union soldiers, and two civilians, to infiltrate Confederate territory.\n\nThe raid, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, involved the soldiers commandeering a locomotive known as the General that was on its way toward Chattanooga. They would stop occasionally along the route to \"tear up track, switches, and bridges, inflicting as much damage as possible.\" The Confederates began chasing the General in handcars and locomotives, at some points even on foot, eventually catching up to them and forcing the Union soldiers to abandon it.\n\nThey were all captured within two weeks, and found guilty of \"acts of unlawful belligerency,\" according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nDr. Shane Makowicki, a US Army historian and expert in the American Civil War, told reporters that both Shadrach and Wilson were convicted as spies, and then executed by hanging.\n\n\"This is absolutely [a story] of intense dedication and commitment, intense bravery and comradery amongst the group of men that had only known each other for a short time, who believed in the mission and believed in the sacrifice and what they were doing to preserve the union,\" Kim Chandler, Wilson's great-great-great-granddaughter, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe operation is now known as the Great Locomotive Chase. While other members of the raid received the Medal of Honor sooner -- six of whom after being released in a prisoner exchange in 1863 -- Brad Quinlan, another historian who assisted in the effort to get Shadrach and Wilson recognized, said bad timing was primarily to blame for the delay in Shadrach and Wilson's recognition. In the aftermath of the raid, he said, their officers were promoted into different units and moved on.\n\n\"It was just at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through, even their comrades who made the visits to Chattanooga and dedicated the monument to the Great Locomotive Chase in 1890, I don't think they even realized that these two men never had the medal. The paperwork never got through,\" Quinlan said.\n\n\"There was nothing anywhere in any of my research, any documentation that said these men did not do what the others have done,\" he added. \"Their bravery, their dignity, and their dedication to the Republic was exactly the same.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-great-nephew, told reporters the posthumous award is the culmination of \"a lot of very hard work\" for his family -- including efforts by his father to contact President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"He was sending stuff to Jimmy Carter years ago, sometimes getting information back and sometimes getting ignored,\" Taylor said.\n\nQuinlan said he was pulled into the fight to get Shadrach and Wilson medals in April 2012 by Ron Shadrach, a great cousin of the Civil War private. It took 12 years of \"researching, finding new documents, primary sources, and submitting the documentation,\" he said.\n\n\"It was just something that needed to be done,\" Ron Shadrach said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson for their participation in a covert operation that took place on April 12, 1862, roughly 200 miles behind Confederate lines. The military operation, which is known as the Great Locomotive Chase, required Union soldiers to dress as civilians, infiltrate the Confederacy, and hijack the \"General Locomotive\" in Georgia.\n\nFox News reported that the operation was intended to destroy the Western and Atlantic Railroad between Atlanta, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, to help the Union bring an end to the Civil War.\n\nAfter hijacking the train, the Union soldiers were pursued by Confederate soldiers on foot and by multiple Confederate trains, including \"The Texas.\"\n\nWhile the covert operatives were able to cause a lot of damage during the operation, the Union soldiers failed to burn the railroad's bridges or cause damage to Tunnel Hill. The train eventually stopped approximately 18 miles from Chattanooga after it ran out of fuel.\n\nREAD MORE: Vietnam vet to receive Medal of Honor for heroic rescue mission\n\nAccording to Fox News, James J. Andrews, who served as a civilian spy and scout during the Civil War, developed the plan for the Great Locomotive Chase. Andrews led 23 men, including Shadrach and Wilson, in the infiltration of the South.\n\nBoth Shadrach and Wilson were captured by Confederate forces and were executed by hanging. Over 162 years later, Biden is posthumously awarding the two Union soldiers with the highest U.S. military honor.\n\nFox News reported that while six of the Union soldiers involved in the Great Locomotive Chase were some of the first recipients of the Medal of Honor, the reason why Shadrach and Wilson were not initially recommended for the Medal of Honor remains unknown.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society's website, \"The Medal is authorized for any military service member who 'distinguishes himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.'\" Over 3,500 service members have been awarded the Medal of Honor.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_frudd@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Timothy Frudd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Andrews, was to cut off Chattanooga, Tenn. from the Confederacy by destroying the railroad tracks, bridges and telegraph lines that connected the city to Atlanta. Twenty-two Union soldiers from Ohio regiments and another civilian joined the plot, which involved sneaking into the South wearing civilian clothes.\n\nOn March 25, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's war secretary bestowed Andrews' Raiders with the country's first Medals of Honor. In the years since, all but two soldiers involved in the raid have received the nation's highest military decoration for their bravery.\n\n\"Privates (Philip G.) Shadrach and (George D.) Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to protect the Union, but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each deserved,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will fix the 161-year-old oversight by honoring Private Philip G. Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson posthumously.\n\nShadrach was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 1840, to Robert and Elizabeth Shadrach, and became an orphan at an early age. Shadrach enlisted in the 2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1861 and volunteered for the dangerous mission at age 21.\n\n\"Like many other young volunteer soldiers, Private Shadrach was willing to encounter both peril and hardship to fight for what he believed in,\" according to a White House news release.\n\nWilson was born in Belmont County, Ohio, in 1830 to George and Elizabeth Wilson. Originally a craftsman, Wilson volunteered for the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1861 and joined Andrews' Raiders shortly after.\n\nOnce Shadrach, Wilson and the others arrived in Georgia, they commandeered a locomotive called \"The General\" and its three boxcars. They stole the train while the crew and passengers were eating breakfast at the Lacy Hotel in Big Shanty, Georgia. The train's conductor chased them, first on foot and later by handcar for 87 miles, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nThe pursuit continued for until about 18 miles from Chattanooga, where the Union soldiers abandoned the \"General\" and fled. They were caught and eight men were later executed by hanging, including Andrews, Shadrach and Wilson.\n\nOne of the raiders wrote about the operation and in 1956, Walt Disney Productions released a film about the event called \"The Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nFor years, Ron Shadrach, a second cousin several times removed of Private Shadrach, has campaigned to honor the two soldiers.\n\nIn 2007, former U.S. Rep. Dave Hobson, R-Springfield, introduced legislation to correct the omission of Shadrach and Wilson's medals. A constituent from Amanda brought the issue to his attention. The following year, Congress authorized honoring the men - but it never happened.\n\n\"These gentlemen were left out. They performed the same heroic acts,\" Hobson said in an interview. \"I thought this is not right. We're going to try to fix this. Finally, we're getting it fixed in my lifetime.\"\n\nBogged down in bureaucracy, the honor was never bestowed. Brown's office took up the mantle in 2015 to recognize the men's bravery and sacrifice.\n\nBrown asked Biden in an October 2023 letter to \"correct this wrong\" and award the soldiers the Medal of Honor. \"It is past time to acknowledge the bravery and meritorious action of Privates Shadrach and Wilson, as well as their sacrifice in defense of the Union.\"\n\nAnd on July 3, 2024, Shadrach and Wilson's time finally came.\n\nJessie Balmert is a reporter for the USA TODAY Network Ohio Bureau, which serves the Columbus Dispatch, Cincinnati Enquirer, Akron Beacon Journal and 18 other affiliated news organizations across Ohio.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach_(Beastie_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Shadrach and Wilson are being recognized for participating in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nRead more: https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/biden-will-bestow-the-medal-of-honor-on-2-civil-war-heroes-who-helped-hijack-a-train", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Gettysburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

George Wilson and Pvt. Shadrach received a long-awaited call from the White House telling them the Civil War heroes would be awarded the nation's highest military honor for \"gallantry and intrepidity\" in defense of the Union.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was on the other line, they said, inviting Theresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Pvt. Wilson, and Gerald Taylor, the great-great-nephew of Pvt. Shadrach, to accept the medal on behalf of the men who, as a part of a group of 24 volunteers, snuck behind Confederate lines in an act of unprecedented bravery.\n\nThe Union soldiers -- acting as spies in civilian clothing -- managed to penetrate 200 miles into Confederate territory, where they commandeered a train -- \"The General\" -- and drove it 87 miles from Georgia to Tennessee.\n\nIn what became known as \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" on April 12, 1862, the Union raiders destroyed Confederate railroad tracks and telegraph lines -- earned 19 of the men Medals of Honor, becoming the first group of Army soldiers to receive it.\n\nThe ambitious plot, despite wreaking havoc, failed. The soldiers were captured. Some escaped and received their medals after the war, while a group of eight of the raiders -- including Wilson and Shadrach -- were tried and hanged by the Confederacy.\n\nBecause of what historians attribute to an oversight, Wilson and Shadrach never received the award posthumously.\n\nRon Shadrach, a descendant of Pvt. Shadrach, who was only 21 when he volunteered for the mission, and historian Brad Quinlon, teamed up to push Shadrach and Wilson's case. Text from a 2008 act of Congress even cleared the way for Wilson and Shadrach to be honored, but for reasons resembling \"red tape,\" some family said, the call simply never came.\n\nShadrach and Quinlon met in 2012 and made their case for 12 years, but even before them, a relative of Pvt. Shadrach was sending letters to President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAt the outset of the Biden Administration, two former generals -- one a four-star -- joined Shadrach and Quinlon's efforts.\n\nQuinlon believes the clandestine mission, which the White House describes as one of the first special operations in United States history, if successful, would have shortened the Civil War by as long as two years.\n\n\"I mean these were common citizens -- a laborer, a carpenter,\" he said.\n\n\"They enlisted. They weren't drafted; they enlisted voluntarily. And then all of a sudden you're getting the word, you know, we're asking for volunteers to come do what? Go in to a hundred miles of Confederate territory to steal a train. They stayed on. They were given a chance, they could have left after that, but they stayed on.\"\n\n\"I guess, unless we've really done it, do we really know what courage that took?\"\n\nBefore they were hanged, Pvt. Wilson is reported to have given a brief speech from the gallows in which he said he did not regret his action to help save the Union.\n\n\"He proclaimed that they would yet see the flag of the United States wave over them again,\" Ron Shadrack said.\n\nTwo years later, they would.\n\nShadrack labored over the case for more than 12 years to rectify the historical record, but, above all, he said, he did so in service of his ancestor's sacrifices.\n\n\"We can't really comprehend what they went through,\" the Ohio native said, a bout of imprisonment that including lashing and torture.\n\n\"I had wanted to serve my country, and I hadn't,\" Shadrack said. \"And so now I've been able to do this...\" he said, choking up, seemingly reckoning with this moment - a present day that would pay tribute to a day 162 years ago for which he has so long fought.\n\n\"And I think it's, it's something that any ordinary American would do,\" he said. \"It's what we do.\"\n\nQuinlon, who in his work has studied the acts of Medal of Honor recipients, said the award -- given to some 3,500 warfighters in U.S. history -- has documented the American story on the battlefield.\n\n\"I wouldn't have taken the project on if I didn't feel it was the right thing to do. I understand the Medal of Honor. I understand where it stands today with our military. And every military person looks up to a Medal of Honor recipients. Even generals take a seat to a Medal of Honor recipient,\" he said.\n\nA future Medal of Honor recipient saved Quinlon's father's life in the Philippines in World War II, losing his life as he fought off the Japanese.\n\n\"I am here because of what William Shockley did on March 31st, 1945. I understand the valor and sacrifice of the Medal of Honor,\" Quinlon said.\n\nBiden to award Medal of Honor to Civil War heroes, 162 years later originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source":

Andrews, was to cut off Chattanooga, Tennessee, from the Confederacy by destroying the railroad tracks, bridges and telegraph lines that connected the city to Atlanta. Twenty-two Union soldiers from Ohio regiments and another civilian joined the plot, which involved sneaking into the South wearing civilian clothes.\n\nOn March 25, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln's war secretary bestowed the group that became known as Andrews' Raiders with the country's first Medals of Honor. In the years since, all but two soldiers involved in the raid have received the nation's highest military decoration for their bravery.\n\n\"Privates (Philip G.) Shadrach and (George D.) Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice of their lives to protect the Union, but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each deserved,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will fix the 161-year-old oversight by posthumously honoring Shadrach and Wilson, who were hanged for the heist.\n\nShadrach was born in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 15, 1840, to Robert and Elizabeth Shadrach, and became an orphan at an early age. Shadrach enlisted in the 2nd Ohio Infantry Regiment in 1861 and volunteered for the dangerous mission at age 21.\n\n\"Like many other young volunteer soldiers, Private Shadrach was willing to encounter both peril and hardship to fight for what he believed in,\" according to a White House news release.\n\nWilson was born in Belmont County, Ohio, in 1830 to George and Elizabeth Wilson. Originally a craftsman, Wilson volunteered for the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1861 and joined Andrews' Raiders shortly after.\n\nOnce Shadrach, Wilson and the others arrived in Georgia, they commandeered a locomotive called \"The General\" and its three boxcars. They stole the train while the crew and passengers were eating breakfast at the Lacy Hotel in Big Shanty, Georgia. The train's conductor chased them, first on foot and later by handcar for 87 miles, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nThe pursuit continued for until about 18 miles from Chattanooga, where the Union soldiers abandoned the \"General\" and fled. They were caught, and eight men were later executed by hanging, including Andrews, Shadrach and Wilson.\n\nOne of the Raiders wrote about the operation and in 1956, Walt Disney Productions released a film about the event called \"The Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nFor years, Ron Shadrach, a second cousin several times removed from Private Shadrach, has campaigned to honor the two soldiers.\n\nIn 2007, former Ohio Rep. Dave Hobson introduced legislation to correct the omission of Shadrach and Wilson's medals after a constituent brought the issue to his attention. The following year, Congress authorized honoring the men - but it never happened.\n\n\"These gentlemen were left out. They performed the same heroic acts,\" Hobson said in an interview. \"I thought this is not right. We're going to try to fix this.

George Wilson and Pvt. Shadrach received a long-awaited call from the White House telling them the Civil War heroes would be awarded the nation's highest military honor for \"gallantry and intrepidity\" in defense of the Union.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was on the other line, they said, inviting Theresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Pvt. Wilson, and Gerald Taylor, the great-great-nephew of Pvt. Shadrach, to accept the medal on behalf of the men who, as a part of a group of 24 volunteers, snuck behind Confederate lines in an act of unprecedented bravery.\n\nThe Union soldiers -- acting as spies in civilian clothing -- managed to penetrate 200 miles into Confederate territory, where they commandeered a train -- \"The General\" -- and drove it 87 miles from Georgia to Tennessee.\n\nIn what became known as \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" on April 12, 1862, the Union raiders destroyed Confederate railroad tracks and telegraph lines -- earned 19 of the men Medals of Honor, becoming the first group of Army soldiers to receive it.\n\nThe ambitious plot, despite wreaking havoc, failed. The soldiers were captured. Some escaped and received their medals after the war, while a group of eight of the raiders -- including Wilson and Shadrach -- were tried and hanged by the Confederacy.\n\nBecause of what historians attribute to an oversight, Wilson and Shadrach never received the award posthumously.\n\nRon Shadrach, a descendant of Pvt. Shadrach, who was only 21 when he volunteered for the mission, and historian Brad Quinlon, teamed up to push Shadrach and Wilson's case. Text from a 2008 act of Congress even cleared the way for Wilson and Shadrach to be honored, but for reasons resembling \"red tape,\" some family said, the call simply never came.\n\nShadrach and Quinlon met in 2012 and made their case for 12 years, but even before them, a relative of Pvt. Shadrach was sending letters to President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAt the outset of the Biden Administration, two former generals -- one a four-star -- joined Shadrach and Quinlon's efforts.\n\nQuinlon believes the clandestine mission, which the White House describes as one of the first special operations in United States history, if successful, would have shortened the Civil War by as long as two years.\n\n\"I mean these were common citizens -- a laborer, a carpenter,\" he said.\n\n\"They enlisted. They weren't drafted; they enlisted voluntarily. And then all of a sudden you're getting the word, you know, we're asking for volunteers to come do what? Go in to a hundred miles of Confederate territory to steal a train. They stayed on. They were given a chance, they could have left after that, but they stayed on.\"\n\n\"I guess, unless we've really done it, do we really know what courage that took?\"\n\nBefore they were hanged, Pvt. Wilson is reported to have given a brief speech from the gallows in which he said he did not regret his action to help save the Union.\n\n\"He proclaimed that they would yet see the flag of the United States wave over them again,\" Ron Shadrack said.\n\nTwo years later, they would.\n\nShadrack labored over the case for more than 12 years to rectify the historical record, but, above all, he said, he did so in service of his ancestor's sacrifices.\n\n\"We can't really comprehend what they went through,\" the Ohio native said, a bout of imprisonment that including lashing and torture.\n\n\"I had wanted to serve my country, and I hadn't,\" Shadrack said. \"And so now I've been able to do this...\" he said, choking up, seemingly reckoning with this moment - a present day that would pay tribute to a day 162 years ago for which he has so long fought.\n\n\"And I think it's, it's something that any ordinary American would do,\" he said. \"It's what we do.\"\n\nQuinlon, who in his work has studied the acts of Medal of Honor recipients, said the award -- given to some 3,500 warfighters in U.S. history -- has documented the American story on the battlefield.\n\n\"I wouldn't have taken the project on if I didn't feel it was the right thing to do. I understand the Medal of Honor. I understand where it stands today with our military. And every military person looks up to a Medal of Honor recipients. Even generals take a seat to a Medal of Honor recipient,\" he said.\n\nA future Medal of Honor recipient saved Quinlon's father's life in the Philippines in World War II, losing his life as he fought off the Japanese.\n\n\"I am here because of what William Shockley did on March 31st, 1945.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously for their gallantry and intrepidity while participating in a covert military operation 200 miles behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862,\" a White House official said. \"In one of the earliest special operations in US Army history, Union Soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy, hijacked a train in Georgia and drove it north for 87 miles, destroying enemy infrastructure along the way.\"\n\nBiden will award the medals in a ceremony at the White House with descendants of Shadrach and Wilson expected to attend.\n\nThe pair were members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1862 when they joined 20 other Union soldiers, and two civilians, to infiltrate Confederate territory.\n\nThe raid, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, involved the soldiers commandeering a locomotive known as the General that was on its way toward Chattanooga. They would stop occasionally along the route to \"tear up track, switches, and bridges, inflicting as much damage as possible.\" The Confederates began chasing the General in handcars and locomotives, at some points even on foot, eventually catching up to them and forcing the Union soldiers to abandon it.\n\nThey were all captured within two weeks, and found guilty of \"acts of unlawful belligerency,\" according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nDr. Shane Makowicki, a US Army historian and expert in the American Civil War, told reporters that both Shadrach and Wilson were convicted as spies, and then executed by hanging.\n\n\"This is absolutely [a story] of intense dedication and commitment, intense bravery and comradery amongst the group of men that had only known each other for a short time, who believed in the mission and believed in the sacrifice and what they were doing to preserve the union,\" Kim Chandler, Wilson's great-great-great-granddaughter, told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe operation is now known as the Great Locomotive Chase. While other members of the raid received the Medal of Honor sooner -- six of whom after being released in a prisoner exchange in 1863 -- Brad Quinlan, another historian who assisted in the effort to get Shadrach and Wilson recognized, said bad timing was primarily to blame for the delay in Shadrach and Wilson's recognition. In the aftermath of the raid, he said, their officers were promoted into different units and moved on.\n\n\"It was just at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through, even their comrades who made the visits to Chattanooga and dedicated the monument to the Great Locomotive Chase in 1890, I don't think they even realized that these two men never had the medal. The paperwork never got through,\" Quinlan said.\n\n\"There was nothing anywhere in any of my research, any documentation that said these men did not do what the others have done,\" he added. \"Their bravery, their dignity, and their dedication to the Republic was exactly the same.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-great-nephew, told reporters the posthumous award is the culmination of \"a lot of very hard work\" for his family -- including efforts by his father to contact President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"He was sending stuff to Jimmy Carter years ago, sometimes getting information back and sometimes getting ignored,\" Taylor said.\n\nQuinlan said he was pulled into the fight to get Shadrach and Wilson medals in April 2012 by Ron Shadrach, a great cousin of the Civil War private. It took 12 years of \"researching, finding new documents, primary sources, and submitting the documentation,\" he said.\n\n\"It was just something that needed to be done,\" Ron Shadrach said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Philip Shadrach and George Wilson will be recognized for their actions in 1862 when they, alongside 20 other Union soldiers and two civilians, infiltrated rebel territory and stole a train, taking it northward and destroying as much of the train tracks, bridges and other key logistical infrastructure as they could. It was a mobile raid over roughly 200 miles during the course of a week while they were constantly pursued by Confederates.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is set to present the medals to the soldiers' descendants at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. Shadrach and Wilson's awards were approved by Congress in 2008, but the ceremony kept getting shifted and was eventually forgotten about.\n\nRead Next: Airman Killed and Multiple Injured in Humvee Crash in Montana, Marking Latest Incident at Nuclear Missile Bases\n\nThe raid is known as the Great Locomotive Chase, and was meant to cripple Confederate logistics and severely restrict where Southern troops could fight -- as trains were the key means of supplying the front lines. In particular, the mission was to obliterate train tracks, bridges and telegraph wires between Atlanta, Georgia, and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nToday, the Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor in the military. However, during the Civil War, it was the only award for valor, and members of the locomotive raid became its very first recipients.\n\nUnion soldiers, including Shadrach and Wilson of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, snuck behind enemy lines and captured a train called \"The General\" in Atlanta when its crew stopped for lunch, and were quickly pursued by William Fuller, the conductor of the captured train, by handcar. Fuller would eventually take control of another train to pursue the Union soldiers during their raid.\n\nRoughly 18 miles outside of Chattanooga, the Union soldiers abandoned their captured train. They were all captured within two weeks, including Shadrach and Wilson, and six were imprisoned for about a year and eventually freed in prisoner exchanges.\n\nEight of them, including Shadrach and Wilson, were hanged in Atlanta.\n\nBut a handful of others did manage to escape and, traveling hundreds of miles on foot, made it back to Union lines.\n\nThe soldiers who returned were awarded the new-at-the-time Medal of Honor; 1st Lt. Jacob Parrott, who was severely tortured as a prisoner of war, became the very first recipient.\n\nThey also were offered commissions to serve as officers by the Union Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. At least one, Parrott, took that commission offer.", "source": {"uri": "military.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Military"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_beynon@military.com", "name": "Steve Beynon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humvee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humvee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Parrott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Parrott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edwin Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handcar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images02.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2024-07/mil-moh-shadrach-and-wilson-1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

There must be incontestable proof of the performance of the meritorious conduct.\n\nSix of the Union soldiers who took part in the military operation became the Army's first-ever recipients of the Medal of Honor on March 25, 1863.\n\nIn total, 19 of the 24 participants in Andrews Raid eventually received the Medal of Honor.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belmont County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/03/id5679853-Biden-Medal-of-Honor-GettyImages-2159857405-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 197, "textEnd": 203}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 394, "textEnd": 402}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

George Wilson and Pvt. Shadrach received a long-awaited call from the White House telling them the Civil War heroes would be awarded the nation's highest military honor for \"gallantry and intrepidity\" in defense of the Union.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was on the other line, they said, inviting Theresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Pvt. Wilson, and Gerald Taylor, the great-great-nephew of Pvt. Shadrach, to accept the medal on behalf of the men who, as a part of a group of 24 volunteers, snuck behind Confederate lines in an act of unprecedented bravery.\n\nThe Union soldiers -- acting as spies in civilian clothing -- managed to penetrate 200 miles into Confederate territory, where they commandeered a train -- \"The General\" -- and drove it 87 miles from Georgia to Tennessee.\n\nIn what became known as \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" on April 12, 1862, the Union raiders destroyed Confederate railroad tracks and telegraph lines -- earned 19 of the men Medals of Honor, becoming the first group of Army soldiers to receive it.\n\nThe ambitious plot, despite wreaking havoc, failed. The soldiers were captured. Some escaped and received their medals after the war, while a group of eight of the raiders -- including Wilson and Shadrach -- were tried and hanged by the Confederacy.\n\nBecause of what historians attribute to an oversight, Wilson and Shadrach never received the award posthumously.\n\nRon Shadrach, a descendant of Pvt. Shadrach, who was only 21 when he volunteered for the mission, and historian Brad Quinlin, teamed up to push Shadrach and Wilson's case. Text from a 2008 act of Congress even cleared the way for Wilson and Shadrach to be honored, but for reasons resembling \"red tape,\" some family said, the call simply never came.\n\nShadrach and Quinlin met in 2012 and made their case for 12 years, but even before them, a relative of Pvt. Shadrach was sending letters to President Jimmy Carter.\n\nAt the outset of the Biden Administration, two former generals -- one a four-star -- joined Shadrach and Quinlin's efforts.\n\nQuinlin believes the clandestine mission, which the White House describes as one of the first special operations in United States history, if successful, would have shortened the Civil War by as long as two years.\n\n\"I mean these were common citizens -- a laborer, a carpenter,\" he said.\n\n\"They enlisted. They weren't drafted; they enlisted voluntarily. And then all of a sudden you're getting the word, you know, we're asking for volunteers to come do what? Go in to a hundred miles of Confederate territory to steal a train. They stayed on. They were given a chance, they could have left after that, but they stayed on.\"\n\n\"I guess, unless we've really done it, do we really know what courage that took?\"\n\nBefore they were hanged, Pvt. Wilson is reported to have given a brief speech from the gallows in which he said he did not regret his action to help save the Union.\n\n\"He proclaimed that they would yet see the flag of the United States wave over them again,\" Ron Shadrack said.\n\nTwo years later, they would.\n\nShadrack labored over the case for more than 12 years to rectify the historical record, but, above all, he said, he did so in service of his ancestor's sacrifices.\n\n\"We can't really comprehend what they went through,\" the Ohio native said, a bout of imprisonment that including lashing and torture.\n\n\"I had wanted to serve my country, and I hadn't,\" Shadrack said. \"And so now I've been able to do this...\" he said, choking up, seemingly reckoning with this moment - a present day that would pay tribute to a day 162 years ago for which he has so long fought.\n\n\"And I think it's, it's something that any ordinary American would do,\" he said. \"It's what we do.\"\n\nQuinlin, who in his work has studied the acts of Medal of Honor recipients, said the award -- given to some 3,500 warfighters in U.S. history -- has documented the American story on the battlefield.\n\n\"I wouldn't have taken the project on if I didn't feel it was the right thing to do. I understand the Medal of Honor. I understand where it stands today with our military. And every military person looks up to a Medal of Honor recipients. Even generals take a seat to a Medal of Honor recipient,\" he said.\n\nA future Medal of Honor recipient saved Quinlin's father's life in the Philippines in World War II, losing his life as he fought off the Japanese.\n\n\"I am here because of what William Shockley did on March 31st, 1945. I understand the valor and sacrifice of the Medal of Honor,\" Quinlin said.\n\nBiden awards Medal of Honor to Civil War heroes, 162 years later originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source":

They would stop occasionally along the route to \"tear up track, switches, and bridges, inflicting as much damage as possible.\" The Confederates began chasing the General in handcars and locomotives, at some points even on foot, eventually catching up to them and forcing the Union soldiers to abandon it.\n\nThey were all captured within two weeks, and found guilty of \"acts of unlawful belligerency,\" according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.\n\nIn this illustration provided by the US Army, Union soldiers tear up a track while commandeering a locomotive known as the General that was on its way toward Chattanooga in April 1862.

While other members of the raid received the Medal of Honor sooner -- six of whom after being released in a prisoner exchange in 1863 -- Brad Quinlan, another historian who assisted in the effort to get Shadrach and Wilson recognized, said bad timing was primarily to blame for the delay in Shadrach and Wilson's recognition. In the aftermath of the raid, he said, their officers were promoted into different units and moved on.\n\n\"It was just at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through, even their comrades who made the visits to Chattanooga and dedicated the monument to the Great Locomotive Chase in 1890, I don't think they even realized that these two men never had the medal. The paperwork never got through,\" Quinlan said.\n\n\"There was nothing anywhere in any of my research, any documentation that said these men did not do what the others have done,\" he added. \"Their bravery, their dignity, and their dedication to the Republic was exactly the same.\"\n\nBrian Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-great-nephew, told reporters the posthumous award is the culmination of \"a lot of very hard work\" for his family -- including efforts by his father to contact President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\"He was sending stuff to Jimmy Carter years ago, sometimes getting information back and sometimes getting ignored,\" Taylor said.\n\nQuinlan said he was pulled into the fight to get Shadrach and Wilson medals in April 2012 by Ron Shadrach, a great cousin of the Civil War private. It took 12 years of \"researching, finding new documents, primary sources, and submitting the documentation,\" he said.\n\n\"It was just something that needed to be done,\" Ron Shadrach said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "haley_britzky@cnn.com", "name": "Haley Britzky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Land Forces", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/cutting-the-telegraph.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 790, "textEnd": 798, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Philip Shadrach and Pvt. George Wilson, members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, are finally set to receive recognition as participants in what is known as the \"Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nOn April 12, 1862, the pair joined 20 other Union soldiers and two civilians in commandeering a train in Georgia, before driving it north while demolishing Confederate railroad tracks and telegraph lines. Both men were captured and executed by hanging.\n\nNow, 162 years later, the soldiers are being recognized for their previously overlooked contributions to an event that others were awarded Medals of Honor for -- including Pvt. Jacob Parrott, the very first service member to be presented with the military's highest award for valor.\n\n\"It touches me deeply,\" Theresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, said Tuesday at a media event. \"I just get so emotional with it, thinking he had such bravery and valor.\"\n\nThe plan was straightforward. By sabotaging the Western and Atlantic Railroad, the men would cut off the Confederacy's ability to move supplies or reinforcements from Atlanta, Georgia, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and deprive them of making strategic advances. Shadrach, Wilson and the others met in Big Shanty, now Kennesaw, Georgia, where they took over a locomotive known as the \"General\" and implemented their operation. But the Confederates caught up, and captured the raiders.\n\n\"More than anything else, it is the story of American soldiers far from home committing extraordinary acts of service and bravery on behalf of their country,\" said Dr. Shane Makowicki, a historian from the Army Center of Military History.\n\nHe and another historian explained that whether it was an initial oversight in the documentation process or a lack of individuals advocating on their behalf, the bravery of Shadrach and Wilson was exactly the same as the other men who participated, most of whom received the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\n\"It was just, at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through,\" said Brad Quinlin, a historian and author, who also suggested that one of the reasons for the delay may have been that their infantry regiment was decimated in another battle, leaving few who could push for them to receive the distinction.\n\nApproval to bestow the decorations on the soldiers came in the fiscal year 2008 annual defense policy bill, though it still took time to get the paperwork in the right hands and across the finish line.\n\nBut, not everyone involved in the risky undertaking has received recognition for their actions.\n\nJames Andrews -- the leader of the group, which became known as Andrews' Raiders -- and William Campbell were not eligible for the Medal of Honor as civilians, though Quinlin said he's working on requests to get them awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAdditionally, one remaining soldier involved in the group, Samuel Llewellyn, does not hold the country's highest military decoration. According to Quinlin, he turned it down, thinking he did not deserve it as he was caught before reaching the rendezvous point.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are buried at Chattanooga National Cemetery in Tennessee, Quinlin shared with Military Times.\n\nKimberly Chandler, a great-great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, described the story of her ancestor as \"one of intense dedication and commitment, intense bravery and camaraderie amongst a group of men that had only known each other for a short time, believed in the mission and believed in the sacrifice of what they were doing to preserve the

C. - The year was 1862. With the Civil War in full throttle, around two dozen Union Army soldiers from Ohio snuck onto Confederate territory with a bold plan to destroy enemy supply lines and infrastructure between Atlanta, Georgia and Chattanooga, Tennessee before a Union attack on Chattanooga.\n\nThe group, known as \"Andrews' Raiders\" because it was led by a civilian spy named James J. Andrews, commandeered a locomotive known as the General near Kennesaw, Georgia, on April 12, 1862, and drove it north along the Western and Atlantic Railroad line for around seven hours, destroying telegraph lines and railroad tracks along the way.\n\nWhen the train ran out of fuel near Ringgold, Georgia, the Ohioans scattered and were apprehended by Confederate troops. Eight of them, including Andrews, were executed as spies. The rest escaped or were exchanged for Confederate prisoners.\n\nFor their role in what became known as \"The Great Locomotive Chase,\" which later became the subject of a 1956 Disney film, six of the Ohioans were awarded the nation's first Medals of Honor. All but two of the non-civilian raid participants subsequently got the award, which is given to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will award the nation's highest military honor to the remaining Ohio soldiers who didn't previously get the award: Private Philip Gephardt Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson. Both were hanged as spies in Atlanta on June 18,1862. They're buried in Chattanooga National Cemetery.\n\nShadrach, a Pennsylvania native who was orphaned at an early age, moved to Ohio before enlisting in Company K of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment out of Jefferson County. Also known as Charles Perry Shadrach, he was 21 when he died.\n\nWilson, a Belmont County native who served in Company B of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment out of Warren County, was in his early 30s when the raid happened. Before enlisting, he was a tradesman who supported his family as a journeyman shoemaker.\n\nA White House official said it's unknown why the pair were initially overlooked for the medal they deserved.\n\nRelatives of the two men will pick up their awards, which were authorized by language in a 2008 defense bill to correct the historic error. Former U.S. Rep. Dave Hobson, a Springfield Republican, said he introduced the measure at the request of a constituent.\n\nA statement from Hobson said he was disappointed it took the Army so long to rectify the mistake, but glad Shadrach and Wilson would finally get the honors they deserve, thanks to his efforts and those of U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Cleveland Democrat.\n\n\"In a time when we see so much divisiveness, the bipartisan commitment to do the right thing and honor these two soldiers with the Medal of Honor can hopefully remind us of the value of national unity and that when we come together as Americans, we can do anything,\" Hobson's statement said.\n\nBrown said his work to correct the historical record required engaging the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, and ultimately the President. He said he's been on the case since 2015.\n\n\"Privates Shadrach and Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice to protect the Union - but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each earned,\" said a statement from Brown.\n\nRon Shadrach of Independence, a cousin of the dead soldier who has long lobbied for the award and established a website that describes Shadrach and Wilson's heroism, travelled to Washington for the ceremony. He says he first found out about Private Shadrach's historic role when he visited relatives in the Columbus area as an elementary schooler, and they showed him a plaque at Ohio's statehouse with the names of Ohioans who took part in the historic raid.\n\nIn 2003, he saw an article about the drive to get medals for Shadrach and Wilson and decided to research how he was connected to the Civil War hero. He learned that the soldier's grandparents, Robert and Eleanor Shadrach, were his own great-great-great-grandparents. He began writing letters to Congress members from Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Tennessee to draw attention to the medals drive, and submitted research to the Defense Department.\n\n\"I am thrilled,\" said Shadrach. \"I can't overstate how exciting this is. I hope that through it, people read their story and understand what these fellows and their comrades went through during that time in our nation's history.\"", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach_(Beastie_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Philip Shadrach, left, and Pvt. George Wilson, right, will be posthumously presented the Medal of Honor for their roles in the \"Great Locomotive Chase\" that took place in 1862. (Army)\n\nTwo Civil War soldiers who infiltrated Confederate territory to steal a train and destroy the enemy railroad system were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Joe Biden on Wednesday.\n\nPvt. Philip Shadrach and Pvt. George Wilson, members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, are finally set to receive recognition as participants in what is known as the \"Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nOn April 12, 1862, the pair joined 20 other Union soldiers and two civilians in commandeering a train in Georgia, before driving it north while demolishing Confederate railroad tracks and telegraph lines. Both men were captured and executed by hanging.\n\nNow, 162 years later, the soldiers are being recognized for their previously overlooked contributions to an event that others were awarded Medals of Honor for -- including Pvt. Jacob Parrott, the very first service member to be presented with the military's highest award for valor.\n\n\"It touches me deeply,\" Theresa Chandler, the great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, said Tuesday at a media event. \"I just get so emotional with it, thinking he had such bravery and valor.\"\n\nThe plan was straightforward. By sabotaging the Western and Atlantic Railroad, the men would cut off the Confederacy's ability to move supplies or reinforcements from Atlanta, Georgia, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and deprive them of making strategic advances. Shadrach, Wilson and the others met in Big Shanty, now Kennesaw, Georgia, where they took over a locomotive known as the \"General\" and implemented their operation. But the Confederates caught up, and captured the raiders.\n\n\"More than anything else, it is the story of American soldiers far from home committing extraordinary acts of service and bravery on behalf of their country,\" said Dr. Shane Makowicki, a historian from the Army Center of Military History.\n\nHe and another historian explained that whether it was an initial oversight in the documentation process or a lack of individuals advocating on their behalf, the bravery of Shadrach and Wilson was exactly the same as the other men who participated, most of whom received the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\n\"It was just, at that moment during our history, nobody was there to stand up for them and move this through,\" said Brad Quinlin, a historian and author, who also suggested that one of the reasons for the delay may have been that their infantry regiment was decimated in another battle, leaving few who could push for them to receive the distinction.\n\nApproval to bestow the decorations on the soldiers came in the fiscal year 2008 annual defense policy bill, though it still took time to get the paperwork in the right hands and across the finish line.\n\nBut, not everyone involved in the risky undertaking has received recognition for their actions.\n\nJames Andrews -- the leader of the group, which became known as Andrews' Raiders -- and William Campbell were not eligible for the Medal of Honor as civilians, though Quinlin said he's working on requests to get them awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nAdditionally, one remaining soldier involved in the group, Samuel Llewellyn, does not hold the country's highest military decoration. According to Quinlin, he turned it down, thinking he did not deserve it as he was caught before reaching the rendezvous point.\n\nShadrach and Wilson are buried at Chattanooga National Cemetery in Tennessee, Quinlin shared with Military Times.\n\nKimberly Chandler, a great-great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, described the story of her ancestor as \"one of intense dedication and commitment, intense bravery and camaraderie amongst a group of men that had only known each other for a short time, believed in the mission and believed in the sacrifice of what they were doing to preserve the

Wilson with posthumous Medals of Honor at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nThey were members of the Andrews' Raiders, 22 men from Ohio, who were members of the 2nd Ohio Infantry and the only two previously not awarded the Medal of Honor due to a clerical error, according to Senator Sherrod Brown's office.\n\n\"Privates Shadrach and Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice to protect the Union,\" he said.\n\nThe descendants of both Wilson and Shadrach accepted the medals on behalf of their ancestors.\n\n>>Woman dies after being rescued from Dayton house fire\n\nBoth Shadrach and Wilson stole a locomotive deep in Confederate territory during the Civil War and drove it north for 87 miles as they destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThey were captured by the Confederates and executed by hanging.\n\nBiden called the operation they joined, \"one of the most dangerous missions of the entire Civil War.\"\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor except for two.

Wilson receive the honors they rightly deserve,\" said Hobson. \"What started as a request from a constituent in Fairfield County led to me sponsoring language in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act waiving the three-year time limit for the soldiers' Medal of Honor applications so that this historic error could be corrected. While it's disappointing that the Army resisted this for so long, I am glad my initial efforts helped lay a foundation for work by Sen.

Philip G. Shadrach and Pvt. George D. Wilson were among Andrews' Raiders -- a group that attempted a daring train hijacking behind Confederate lines in Georgia in 1862 before the participants were caught and most of them executed.\n\nNearly all of them received the then-newly created Medal of Honor not long after. But because of what advocates say was an administrative error, Shadrach and Wilson did not -- until now.\n\n\"Today's decision rectifies a historical oversight that has deprived Privates Shadrach and Wilson from receiving our nation's highest military honor for valor on the battlefield,\" David Currey, the executive director of Chattanooga's Medal of Honor Heritage Center, said in a statement. \"The incredible story of Andrews' Raid and the Great Locomotive Chase created the first of several undeniable historical connections between Chattanooga and the Medal of Honor.\"\n\nPhoto GalleryBiden to award pothumous Medal of Honor for two men buried in Chattanooga, for role in 'Great Locomotive Chase'\n\nThe award ceremony is set for Wednesday evening at the White House.\n\n(SIGN UP: Get today's Chattanooga area news, sports and entertainment directly to your inbox. Sign up for our free newsletters at timesfreepress.com/newsletters.)\n\nIt is the culmination of a decades-long effort by descendants of the men and other advocates to get Shadrach and Wilson recognition for the role they played in a dangerous mission, which, a historian told reporters by phone this week, could have significantly shortened the Civil War.\n\nThe mission is named for the civilian scout James Andrews', who in 1862 recruited roughly two dozen soldiers from Ohio-based regiments for his plan.\n\nHe'd just aborted an attempt to hijack a locomotive behind Confederate lines and destroy communications and supply lines between Atlanta and Chattanooga. Then, he tried again.\n\nAndrews and the men, including Shadrach and Wilson, set off South in small groups, instructed to report to any suspicious types that they were Kentuckians escaping Yankees, moving South to enlist.\n\n(READ MORE: The story of Medal of Honor recipient Charles Coolidge)\n\nThe charade required subtlety. According to one report, Shadrach and another soldier, upon meeting a farmer, expressed radical \"southern views\" -- and were later chastised by Wilson for being \"better rebels than the rebels themselves.\"\n\nSome Tennesseans they encountered were indeed suspicious. Others were \"elated\" to meet men apparently coming to join the Confederates. At one point, some undercover men lodged with a \"slave hunter\" who, one later recalled, \"tracked Negroes with bloodhounds for money.\"\n\nThe raiders walked and talked their way to Chattanooga, from which they caught a southbound train to Marietta, Georgia, where they booked into a hotel for the night.\n\n\"The uncertainty of what the light of the next day's sun would bring in our particular cases was the reason some of us, myself at least of the number, didn't sleep very much,\" one member of the party said in a later account.\n\nBy the next setting sun, he added, he and his comrades might be hanging from the limbs of trees along the railroad -- or they might, having left behind them a trail of fire and destruction, be triumphantly rolling their stolen locomotive back behind Union lines.\n\nOn the morning of April 12, 1862, the men bought tickets north. The train was called The General. Seated on board, one of the men later recalled, the conspirators appeared \"pale but steady.\"\n\nBig Shanty -- modern day Kennesaw, Georgia -- was a meal stop. Participants recalled that the hijackers walked leisurely to the head of the train. They got on the engine and a few box cars, unattached them, threw open a valve, and the train was off.\n\nIt did not initially make it far. The steam engine wasn't hot, and the train soon slowed to a stop, participants recalled. But just as pursuers on foot approached, the hijackers, who had been feeding in fuel, got the train going again.\n\nAs they rolled slowly North, the men pulled into stations as if nothing was amiss, talking their way through skeptical local operators, or the conductors of other trains, which they inconvenienced or nearly collided with.\n\nHeading North past Dalton, the hijackers cut more telegraph wire, but historians say they struggled to fundamentally sabotage the railway as planned. With others in pursuit, they could not stop long to damage the rail -- and rain, survivors recalled, undermined their efforts to burn infrastructure such as bridges.\n\n(READ MORE: VA buys site in Meigs County to expand Chattanooga National Cemetery)\n\nAround Ringgold, The General ran out of fuel, and the men jumped off and scattered.\n\nThey were taken prisoner within days. Some were later taken to Atlanta. Many were hanged -- Shadrach and Wilson among them (their remains were later moved to Chattanooga National Cemetery). Others escaped or were traded as prisoners of war.\n\nThe Medal of Honor had just been created, and for their valor most of the men were soon awarded it.\n\nWhy Shadrach and Wilson were not is not entirely clear; in a call with reporters, historian Brad Quinlin said there is no evidence they acted with any less bravery than their comrades. It was a hectic time in the war, he said, and the officers above the men apparently did not see the awards in their case through.\n\nThe effort to rectify this has long been underway, and in 2008, U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to authorize granting the men the Medal of Honor.\n\nMultiple presidential administrations later, however, this still had not happened. A website was created -- hadrachandwilsonmoh.com -- to bolster the cause as advocates, some in the Chattanooga area, lobbied to get the effort across the finish line.\n\nIn some ways, the push to get Shadrach and Wilson posthumous medals resembled the effort to get Chattanooga-area man Larry Taylor the medal for his daring helicopter rescue during the Vietnam War, decades after it took place.\n\nBiden awarded him the medal last year. Taylor died in January.\n\nContact Andrew Schwartz at aschwartz@timesfreepress.com or 423-757-6431.", "source": {"uri": "timesfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "timesfreepress.com"},

REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz\n\nBy Andrea Shalal\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden awarded the Medal of Honor on Wednesday to two late U.S. Army privates who were part of a daring Union Army contingent that stole a Confederate train during the Civil War.\n\nThe White House ceremony offered Biden a brief respite from the mounting criticism of some fellow Democrats after his shaky and halting performance in last week's presidential debate against Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\nPhilip Shadrach and George Wilson were honored posthumously during a White House ceremony that recognized their \"gallantry and intrepidity\" during what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase, one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history, according to the White House.\n\nBiden read remarks honoring the men's actions from a teleprompter and made no noticeable errors in delivery. His son, Hunter Biden, was in the audience.\n\nThe Civil War operation took place 200 miles (322 km) behind Confederate lines on April 12, 1862. Union soldiers dressed as civilians commandeered a train and drove it north toward Chattanooga, Tennessee, placing explosives on the track behind them to destroy Confederate infrastructure.\n\nSix of those participants became the Army's first recipients of the then-newly created Medal of Honor. Shadrach and Wilson were both hanged for their actions after being captured. They were not previously given presidential honors.\n\n\"Today, we right that wrong,\" Biden said. \"Today, they finally receive the recognition they deserve.\"\n\nThe Medal of Honor is awarded to military servicemembers who distinguish themselves at the risk of their own lives.\n\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; additional reporting by Steve Holland; editing by Trevor Hunnicutt)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chandler, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/d0/3d0c467b-c1e1-5921-8a77-de67434d30a4/66851496dbed9.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 1434, "textEnd": 1442}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson, members of the Union Army's 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment, received the Medal of Honor on their behalf during a White House ceremony led by President Biden.\n\n\"Every soldier who joined that mission was awarded the Medal of Honor, except for two soldiers who died because of that operation, but never received this recognition,\" Biden said. \"Today, we right that wrong.\"\n\nThe event closed a decades-long campaign by the men's families to rectify what they and many historians came to see as an unjust oversight in recognizing everyone involved in what became known as the Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nShadrach and Wilson were among a group of 24 who carried out the brazen plan in April 1862, commandeering a train outside Atlanta and blazing an 87-mile path of destruction north through Georgia to the Tennessee line with adversaries in hot pursuit. When the chase finally ended, the raiders were captured, and eight were put to death. Most escaped, though several were held as prisoners of war for nearly a year.\n\nNineteen soldiers received the Medal of Honor - including the first ever awarded - for their role in the mission. (Several of them were recognized posthumously.) Another soldier, captured before the raid began, later refused the award, historians said. Two others involved were civilians and did not rate it.\n\nWilson, who was 32 when he died, was a dedicated father and and relished debate, Biden said. \"He always was ready to persuade, argue, and as one family member put it, dress anyone down if the need be,\" he said. Shadrach, who was 21, \"was a free spirit, always searching for adventure, excitement, intrigue,\" the president added.\n\nIn an emotional discussion with reporters earlier, Shadrach's and Wilson's descendants swelled with pride knowing that the efforts of their ancestors and their families' grass-roots lobbying effort, alongside historians, was at last recognized.\n\nSome who made the trip to Washington were acquainted with the story long ago. Others, including Wilson's great-great-granddaughter Theresa Chandler, learned from the Army only four years ago that her lineage included a prominent Civil War figure.\n\nNow 85, she said it has reshaped a legacy nearly lost to history.\n\n\"I would have given anything,\" she said, \"to be able to say, 'Grandpa, tell me about it. ... What was it like?'\"\n\nChandler beamed as Biden presented her he medal in a wooden display case.\n\nThe mission was born from a desire to destroy the South's ability to move troops and military equipment.\n\nMaj. Gen. Ormsby M. Mitchel, assigned by the Union to its Tennessee campaign, mulled how to best attack Chattanooga, a well-defended Confederate citadel located along vital water and rail lines. If invaded head on, the rebels could flood the area with reinforcements on train cars from the south and overwhelm U.S. forces, he concluded.\n\nJames J. Andrews, a civilian spy for the North, crafted a novel solution. A small team of volunteers would travel 200 miles into Confederate territory dressed as civilians, steal a train engine, and then destroy tracks and burn bridges to strangle the secessionists' logistical lines.\n\nThe plan faced setbacks from the start, said Shane Makowicki, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military History. It had rained ahead of the mission, making it difficult to ignite the bridges. The soldiers lacked tools and had to improvise, he said. And while some had experience with trains, there were little if any preparations undertaken beforehand.\n\n\"That speaks to the courage and heroism of these men that they volunteered for this,\" Makowicki said. \"Today, if we were going to send people to do this, you have months or weeks of specialized training.\"\n\nThe mission, lead by Andrews, began with an arduous movement on foot in small groups, often at night through mud and rain, convincing civilians along the way that they were looking to enlist in the Confederacy. They assembled north of Atlanta in present day Kennesaw, Ga., where the team seized a locomotive named the General and its three boxcars. The conductor, William Fuller, gathered a party and gave chase on foot before taking over a hand car and eventually several other locomotives to catch up with the Union soldiers.\n\nThe raid party made periodic stops to tear out track ties and sever telegraph cables in a bid to prevent other Confederate troops from learning about the raid. Oncoming trains on the single track forced the General to stop several times, according to an Army summary of the mission.\n\nIn other cases, the raiders employed subterfuge to make it past authorities. At one stop, Andrews told a station master he was orders from Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard to deliver ammunition to Confederate troops in Chattanooga. The station master allowed them to pass.\n\nAs Fuller and his party closed in, the Union raiders aboard the General, low on wood to feed the engine, abandoned the locomotive 18 miles short of Chattanooga, Biden said, ending the mission after nearly seven hours of intense pursuit. The men scattered, but all were eventually captured within two weeks.\n\n\"They were taken to a Confederate prison, held in a tiny underground room, chained by their necks and their wrists, starved,\" Biden said. \"Still, the men remained unbowed and unbroken.\"\n\nAndrews and seven others, including Shadrach and Wilson, were tried as spies and saboteurs and hanged. Chattanooga fell the next year.\n\nJacob Parrott, who was severely beaten in captivity, was among those who survived the ordeal and later made history as the first service member to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nHistorians and family members could only speculate why Shadrach and Wilson were overlooked for so long. The unit was involved in heavy fighting afterward, and officers who would have kept track of such accomplishments were pushed to other units, said Brad Quinlin, a historian and author involved in advocating the men's Medals of Honor.\n\nSome members of the Shadrach family had pushed for the recognition since the Carter administration, they said. A 2008 spending bill included a provision to award the medal to the two men, but momentum did not pick up until 2012, when Quinlin and family member Ron Shadrach met. They later submitted fresh evidence for defense officials to review.\n\n\"There was nothing anywhere in any of my research, any documentation, that said these men did not do what the others have done,\" Quinlin said.\n\nAlthough the mission ultimately failed, it is remembered as a prominent moment of the Civil War and has yielded books and films, including Buster Keaton's \"The General\" in 1926 and \"The Great Locomotive Chase\" in 1956.\n\nBrian Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-great-nephew, said delving into family history left him in awe, and doing so with his father deepened their relationship. They lovingly call Shadrach \"Uncle Stealer,\" and Taylor once climbed aboard the General, now a museum piece in Georgia.\n\nAhead of the White House ceremony, Taylor strummed an acoustic guitar and crooned a song he wrote about the mission. \"Do it for the glory, boys,\" he sang, \"because you may not find your way back home tonight.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadrach_(Beastie_Boys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shadrach (Beastie Boys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_hijacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft hijacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Locomotive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Philip G. Shadrach and Pvt. George D. Wilson will posthumously receive the Medal of Honor for the raid sometimes dubbed 'one of the earliest special operations missions.'\n\nTwo Ohio soldiers who stole a Confederate train and left a 200-mile trail of havoc through the South will posthumously receive the Medal of Honor on Wednesday. Pvt. Philip G. Shadrach and Pvt. George D. Wilson were two members of a team of Union soldiers who were captured and executed after taking part in a daring Civil War mission behind enemy lines that came to be known as 'the Great Locomotive Chase.'\n\nThe men were part of a covert team sent to disrupt the Confederacy's railroad system in April 1862. At the time, they were assigned to the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment.\n\nWilson and Shadrach both distinguished themselves beyond the call of duty, according to their Medal of Honor citations, which also praised their \"gallant actions in close contact with the enemy.\"\n\nTwenty-two Union soldiers and two civilians led by James J. Andrews - a spy from Kentucky - embarked on a raid to destroy Confederate railways and telegraph lines from Georgia to Tennessee. Their audacious plan was to travel hundreds of miles into Confederate territory to meet outside Marietta, Georgia to commandeer a train engine. They named the General and headed out to Chattanooga, tearing up tracks, destroying bridges, and cutting the telegraph along roughly 200 miles.\n\nThe group, who came to be known as Andrew's Raiders, was slowed by having to stop for oncoming trains on the single-track railway and eventually had to flee from their pursuers about 18 miles short of Chattanooga. Within 12 days, they were all captured. On June 18, 1862, Wilson and Shadrach were among the seven of the raiders who were hanged as spies. Andrews was hanged separately 11 days earlier.\n\nSubscribe to Task & Purpose today. Get the latest military news and culture in your inbox daily.\n\nWilson's great-great granddaughter Theresa Chandler told reporters on Tuesday that she wished that young Americans could learn more about what Andrews' raiders went through.\n\nChandler's voice broke as she talked about how her great-great grandfather's last words before being hanged were about how he was willing to fight for his country and he had no ill will toward Southerners.\n\n\"Sorry for being so emotional, but it touches deeply,\" Chandler said at a media roundtable.\n\nNineteen of the 22 Union soldiers who took part in the raid became the first U.S. soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor, said Brad Quinlin, a historian based in Georgia. One soldier declined the award when offered it because he was captured early in the operation.\n\nShadrach and Wilson were part of every aspect of the mission, Quinlin told Task & Purpose. It's unclear why they were not initially awarded the Medal of Honor along with the other soldiers who participated in the operation, he said.\n\nThe Civil War was quite chaotic at the time, he said. Some of the raiders escaped and the rest were later freed in a prisoner exchange. The 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment took such heavy casualties at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863 that it was folded into another unit and many of the regiment's original officers were promoted and posted elsewhere.\n\n\"So, there was just nobody there to stand up for them for a length of time,\" Quinlin said. \"It does happen, and with events after the war, there was such chaos - it took until the 1880s for families to get notification of what happened to their loved ones during the war itself. So, you can imagine: These two men were just overlooked.\"\n\nIn 2012, Quinlin was asked by one of Shadrach's relatives to help get both men awarded the Medal of Honor. Over the next 12 years, Quinlin submitted 26 awards packets until he recently heard from the White House that the two men would finally be recognized for their heroism 162 years after their deaths.\n\nAfter so many years, the award represents resolution for both Wilson and Shadrach's families, Quinlin said.\n\n\"I volunteer at the Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga,\" Quinlin said. I can't tell you how many times I've stood in front of these graves and the graves of their comrades and seen the Medal of Honor insignia on the other Union soldiers but not on Philip's and George's graves. It's been a process. New friendships have been built - lifelong friendships with the families. And yesterday, as we met for interviews with the press, there were a lot of tears shed as we all realized that at 4:45 this afternoon in the White House, these two men will stand with their comrades as Medal of Honor recipients.\"", "source": {"uri": "taskandpurpose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Task & Purpose"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_schogol@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Jeff Schogol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Mr. Biden said the honor was a \"long time coming.\"\n\nThe president honored Philip Shadrach and George Wilson for their \"gallantry and intrepidity\" in carrying out a covert operation called the \"Great Locomotive Chase,\" which played out 200 miles behind Confederate lines in Georgia in 1862, the White House said. Union soldiers dressed as civilians infiltrated the Confederacy, hijacked a train and drove it north for 87 miles, destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way.\n\n\"For Philip and George and their brothers in arms, serving our country meant serving our country, our country, fighting and even dying to preserve the Union and the sacred values it was founded upon -- freedom, justice, fairness, unity,\" the president said. \"George and Philip were willing to shed their blood to make these ideals real.\"\n\nThe descendants of Wilson and Shadrack accepted the medals on behalf of their ancestors.\n\nThe operation, one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history, was hatched by James Andrews, a Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout. He proposed penetrating the Confederacy with the goal of degrading their railway and communications lines to cut off Chattanooga, Tennessee, from Confederate supplies and reinforcements.\n\nAndrews, together with 23 other men, infiltrated the South in small groups, coming together north of Atlanta. On April 12, 1862, 22 of the men commandeered a locomotive called The General and ventured north, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires as they went. The men became known as the Andrews' Raiders.\n\nShadrach, originally from Pennsylvania and orphaned at a young age, was just 21 when he volunteered for the mission. On Sept. 20, 1861, he left home and enlisted in a Union Army Ohio Infantry Regiment. Wilson, born in Ohio, was a journeyman shoemaker before he enlisted in a Union Army's Ohio Volunteer Infantry in 1861. He also volunteered for the Andrews' Raid.\n\nAfter the operation, both men were captured, convicted as spies and hanged.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, until the very end, George and Philip believed in the United States of America, the only nation on earth founded on an idea,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Every other nation in the history of the world is based on geography, ethnicity, religion or some other attribute. But we're the only nation founded on an idea. That idea is that all men are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. We haven't always lived up to that, but like George and Philip, we've never walked away from it, either. Their heroic deeds went unacknowledged for over a century, but time did not erase their valor.\"\n\nThe ceremony comes as questions mount over Mr. Biden's future as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, with his public appearances under intense scrutiny following his halting performance at last week's presidential debate. After the Medal of Honor ceremony, the president is meeting with Democratic governors to address their concerns and chart his path forward.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Philip Gephart Shadrach and Pvt. George Davenport Wilson for their heroism and courage during the Great Locomotive Chase of 1862.\n\nEach Soldier's oldest living relative will accept the award during a ceremony at the White House today.\n\n\"To volunteer for a venture they knew little about, and to know if they failed, they would be put to death, makes me realize how dedicated they were,\" said Gerald Taylor, Shadrach's great-great-nephew. \"I am humbled to have the opportunity to come and receive the Medal of Honor that was awarded to our relative.\"\n\nBoth Shadrach and Wilson were part of a group of 24 Soldiers and civilians that became known as Andrews' Raiders.\n\nIn early April 1862, James J. Andrews, a Kentucky-born civilian spy, led the group on a mission to infiltrate the South and destroy the railway and communication lines that supported the Confederacy from Georgia to Tennessee.\n\nThe raiders traveled hundreds of miles in enemy territory through heavy rain and harsh terrain. They did their best to avoid suspicion by wearing civilian clothing and traveling in small groups. Despite several close calls, 22 of them met just outside of Marietta, Georgia in Big Shanty, where they commandeered a locomotive named the General and headed north. They tore up the railroad track, cut telegraph lines and tried to burn bridges along the way.\n\nWilliam Fuller, the General's conductor, and a few Confederates chased after them, first on foot and then by handcar and locomotive. The raiders had a lead on their pursuers but were slowed down while completing their mission and stopping for oncoming trains on the single-track railway.\n\nRunning low on fuel, and with the Confederates on their heels, the raiders abandoned their effort just 18 miles from their final stop in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The men fled, trying to avoid capture.\n\nThousands of Confederate soldiers and citizens began scouring the countryside for the raiders. After 12 days, all 22 of the men were captured and taken as prisoners.\n\nAndrews and seven Soldiers, including Shadrach and Wilson, were tried and convicted as spies. The Soldiers were executed June 18, 1862.\n\nAccording to historical documents, just before Wilson was put to death, he addressed the crowd and said he felt no hostility toward them and did not regret dying for his country because he knew the people would soon see the Union flag flying over them once again.\n\n\"When I read that, I had chills,\" said Theresa Chandler, Wilson's great-great-granddaughter. \"It brought everything home, and you get so much more respect and appreciation for what they did and what they were fighting for.\"\n\nThe remaining raiders staged a prison escape after seeing the fate of their compatriots. Although most succeeded in making it to safety, six of the Soldiers were recaptured.\n\nThey were eventually released as part of a prisoner exchange in March 1863. All six men were awarded the Medal of Honor - the first Soldiers in U.S. Army history to earn the award - and were offered commissions as first lieutenants. In the years following, 13 other raiders received the medal as well.\n\nThe award, signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 12, 1862, bestowed an Army Medal of Honor \"to such non-commissioned officers and privates as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier-like qualities during the present insurrection.\"\n\nBoth Shadrach and Wilson were members of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Now, 162 years after their heroics during the Great Locomotive Chase, both men are finally being honored.", "source": {"uri": "army.mil", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.army.mil"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James J.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson will posthumously be awarded Medals of Honor for their bravery and dedication to protecting the Union. Privates Shadrach and Wilson were members of the Andrews' Raiders - 22 men from Ohio who were members of the 2nd Ohio Infantry. Privates Shadrach and Wilson gave their lives to protect the Union. They are the only two Raiders who were not awarded the Medal of Honor due to a clerical error.\n\nSince 2015 Brown has called on multiple presidents to correct this error and posthumously award Privates Shadrach and Wilson the Medal of Honor. In October, Brown called on President Biden to take action and previously pushed the Department of Defense and White House to re-examine this historical oversight and award the Medal of Honor to these deserving soldiers. At each step of review, Brown worked to ensure that the historical record was corrected. This involved engaging the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of Defense, and ultimately the President.\n\n\"Privates Shadrach and Wilson heroically served our nation during the Civil War, making the ultimate sacrifice to protect the Union - but because of a clerical error, they never received the Medal of Honor they each earned. It's why we've been calling on the White House since 2015 to posthumously award Privates Shadrach and Wilson Medals of Honor to recognize their bravery, sacrifice, and dedication to our country,\" said Brown.\n\nBrown's efforts were bipartisan and Bicameral, building on the work of former Congressman Dave Hobson (R-OH) to secure the recognition these brave Civil War veterans earned. Former Congressman Hobson successfully added an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act granting the authority to posthumously award the Medal of Honor to Private Shadrach and Private Wilson.\n\n\"I am proud to have played a part in seeing that Pvt. Shadrach and Pvt. Wilson receive the honors they rightly deserve. What started as a request from a constituent in Fairfield County led to me sponsoring language in the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act waiving the three-year time limit for the soldiers' Medal of Honor applications so that this historic error could be corrected. While it's disappointing that the Army resisted this for so long, I am glad my initial efforts helped lay a foundation for work by Sen. Brown and others to move the soldiers' case forward and make this recognition possible,\" said Former Congressman Dave Hobson.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perry County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perry County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hobson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Hobson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bicameralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_County,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fairfield County, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairfield County, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Militaria", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Militaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors_and_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Honors and Awards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702780", "eventUri": "eng-9702780", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Wilson, part of what is now known by historians as the Great Locomotive Chase, have languished for years as it was unclear why they were not initially considered and a House bill passed in 2008 to honor the soldiers in 2008 did not produce any action until now.\n\nDescendants of both men will be on hand at the White House for the ceremony.\n\nThe soldiers are credited with infiltrating the Confederacy, hijacking a train and driving it 87 miles north, destroying railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires along the way that hampered the South.\n\nThey were a part of a group of 24 Union soldiers that caused the mayhem from Georgia to Tennessee with the Confederate military trying to track them down.\n\nHistorians said the group's bravery and ingenuity were highlighted by the fact that some had no experience in rail operation.

Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson in celebrating the White House announcement that the Medal of Honor will be awarded to these two American heroes for their selfless heroic act of valor during the Andrews' Raid on April 12, 1862.\n\n\"Today's decision rectifies a historical oversight that has deprived Privates Shadrach and Wilson from receiving our nation's highest military honor for valor on the battlefield. The incredible story of Andrews Raid and the Great Locomotive Chase led to the awarding of the first Medals of Honor in our nation's history. It also created the first of several undeniable historical connections between Chattanooga and the Medal of Honor that ultimately established Chattanooga as the Birthplace of the Medal of Honor.\n\n\"We thank everyone who helped make this day possible. We look forward to honoring Medal of Honor Recipients Shadrach and Wilson as part of our Great Locomotive Chase exhibit that tells the heroic acts of valor from that day and through our mission that shared the incredible stories of Medal of Honor Recipients to inspire the next generation about six character traits that embody the Medal of Honor: Patriotism, Citizenship, Courage, Integrity, Sacrifice and Commitment.\n\n\"In the coming weeks, the Heritage Center will make an announcement on how Chattanooga, Hamilton County and the surrounding communities can come together and help honor these two American heroes this year and all Medal of Honor recipients in 2025.\"\n\nThe White House ceremony to present the Medal of Honor to the families of Private Philip G. Shadrach and Private George D. Wilson is scheduled for 4:45 p.m. on Wednesday.

One soldier who was stopped by Confederates near Jasper and never made it to Georgia for the raid was offered the Medal, but he declined.\n\nNow the final 2 soldiers who were a part of the Great Locomotive Chase will be honored at the White House more than 162 years after the raid.\n\nMembers of the Shadrach and Wilson families, historian Brad Quinlin, representatives from the Charles H. Coolidge National Medal of Honor Heritage Center in Chattanooga, Retired Army General B. B. Bell and many others have been working to get these two soldiers awarded the Medal of Honor for several years.\n\nThere were 24 men who left Shelbyville, Tennessee in April of 1862 on a secret mission that would later be called Andrews' Raid or The Great Locomotive Chase. Among the 24 men were 2 civilians, James Andrews, the leader of the group and William Campbell, along with 22 soldiers from 3 regiments of the Ohio Volunteer Infantry.\n\nAndrews' Raiders went on a mission to steal a train in what was then Big Shanty now Kennesaw, Georgia. They planned to race north and destroy the railroad and communication lines between Atlanta and Chattanooga. The mission ultimately failed as the Raider's encountered many obstacles including rain, being chased by the conductor of the train they stole, having to wait for oncoming trains to pass, among other problems.\n\nThe Raiders eventually abandoned the train just outside of Ringgold, Georgia. They ran, but were eventually captured and eventually taken to a jail in Chattanooga. 8 were executed for their part in the raid. 8 more later escaped from prison. The 6 remaining Raiders were later part of a prisoner exchange. Those 6 were the first to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Private Jacob Parrott was the first soldier to receive the Medal.\n\nShadrach and Wilson participated in every part of this mission and they were publicly executed in downtown Atlanta on June 18, 1862.", "source": {"uri": "wlos.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLOS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davenport, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perry, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perry, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Coolidge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles H.

They abandoned the General near Chattanooga, Tenn., per the Hill. Within two weeks, they were captured. Most of the Union forces escaped, though eight men were put to death, and several were held as prisoners of war for almost a year. Shadrach and Wilson were among those tried as spies and saboteurs and hanged. The 1926 silent film The General, starring Buster Keaton, was based on the mission, per the AP, as was the 1956 Disney film The Great Locomotive Chase.\n\nShadrach and Wilson, who both had enlisted, could have backed out of the mission, Biden pointed out. \"Today, if we were going to send people to do this, you have months or weeks of specialized training,\" a military historian said.

George Davenport Wilson were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroism and courage during the Great Locomotive Chase of 1862.\n\nThe Great Locomotive Chase is one of the earliest special operations in U.S. Army history.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Army, 24 Union soldiers infiltrated the Confederacy and hijacked a train in Georgia, driving it north toward rebel-held Chattanooga, Tennessee and destroying enemy infrastructure along the way.\n\nAlthough caught by rebel pursuers after an 87-mile chase, six Union soldiers became the first recipients of the Medal of Honor.\n\nThe plan was hatched by James J. Andrews, a Kentucky-born Union spy and scout.\n\nAndrews and 23 other men stole the General just north of Marietta on Apr. 12, 1862. They proceeded northward, tearing up railroad tracks and cutting telegraph wires.\n\nThe General's conductor, William Fuller, led the pursuit, including the locomotive Texas.\n\nThe General was slowed by the Union sabotage efforts and the need to allow trains to pass on the single-track railway, giving Fuller the opportunity to catch up to the General.\n\nThe Raiders abandoned their effort 18 miles short of Chattanooga. All of the Raiders were captured within two weeks.\n\nAndrews was tried and executed on June 7, 1862. Seven other members of the expedition were hanged on June 18.\n\nThe remaining Raiders staged a prison escape. Most made it to safety, but six of the Union soldiers were recaptured. They were later released in a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe Great Locomotive Chase became the basis for several books and movies, including Buster Keaton's 1926 film The General.\n\nThe train resides at The Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw.\n\nExecutive Director Richard Banz says the locomotive serves as a reminder of the courage of the young men.\n\n\"It's an absolute exercise in bravery and daring. I think they had a deep commitment to their community, to their country, to their ideals, and that's what they stuck to,\" he said. \"They put themselves aside and thought, what is the best thing I can do for my community, for my country? and so I think that's a very valuable lesson.\"\n\nEach Soldier's oldest living relative accepted the award during a ceremony at the White House.", "source": {"uri": "atlantanewsfirst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Locomotive_Chase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Great Locomotive Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "James J.

It became known as the Great Locomotive Chase. The raiders were captured within two weeks. Though some eventually escaped, eight were hanged.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Joe Biden will posthumously award the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military award for valor -- to two of those who were executed, Pvts. Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson of the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry Regiment.\n\nWilson was a Belmont County native who enlisted in the 2nd Ohio Voluntary Infantry Regiment in Franklin, in Warren County.\n\n\"Our country was young,\" said Scott Chandler, Wilson's great-great-great grandson. \"He had the conviction to want to keep that going the way it had been established. And he was willing to die for it. I can't think of any sacrifice that is more meaningful in so many ways.\"\n\nMost the other raiders have been honored already with the medal, except for one who refused it and some civilians who were not eligible for it. Historians say it took so long for Shadrach and Wilson to be honored in this way partly because of an oversight. After the raid, their superiors were promoted to other regiments and transferred West, so Shadrach and Wilson had no one to advocate for them.\n\nAt Biden's invitation, Shadrach's great-great-nephew, Gerald Taylor, plans to attend the ceremony with his children and grandchildren.\n\n\"I am very humbled and proud to be able to come down here and get this award,\" said Taylor, a retired insurance executive from Ontario, Canada. \"We are all so thrilled.\"\n\nBrad Quinlin, a historian and author based in Suwanee, was among those who worked to get the medals approved. He painstakingly gathered historic records and met with White House and Pentagon officials and then-U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall. For Quinlin, it was a matter of fairness.\n\n\"I dug through thousands of documents,\" Quinlin said by phone Monday as he drove toward Washington, D.C., to attend the ceremony. \"It just ate at me.\"\n\nThe historic train chase made it to the big screen decades later. Buster Keaton starred in a 1926 comedy named after the locomotives the raiders stole, \"The General.\" And Disney released a film about it in 1956, \"The Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nThe train remains on display at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History in Kennesaw. Richard Banz, who leads the museum, said Tuesday he was struck by the raiders' courage. \"If someone said to me, 'Hey, listen, let's work our way behind enemy lines and steal a train.' I would be like, 'Huh?' For all of these folks, the bravery is not in question,\" he said.\n\nGordon Jones serves as a senior military historian for the Atlanta History Center, which features the locomotive used to chase the raiders. Jones praised those who worked for years to get the medals approved for Shadrach and Wilson.\n\n\"That is a great American story,\" he said. \"And it just shows that individuals can still make a difference.\"\n\nThe Marietta History Center, which is located in the former hotel where most of the raiders stayed the night before their mission, has redesigned one of the rooms to look as it did at the time.\n\n\"When we are somewhat divided in our country, to honor these men, who worked so hard to keep our country united, is really a very important part of where we are today,\" said Amy Reed, who directs the center. \"The timing of it all is really cool.\"\n\nShadrach's and Wilson's descendants said it is particularly meaningful for Biden to present the medals just before Independence Day.\n\nFormer U.S. Congressman Dave Hobson, who represented parts of the Dayton and Springfield area for nearly two decades, lobbied for years for Wilson to be recognized, which included Congressional action waiving the usual rules for awarding the medal. Hobson, a Republican, noted in a statement that he worked closely with Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown to have these men recognized.\n\n\"The bipartisan work of myself and Sen. Brown is fitting given the commitment to national unity that Pvt. Shadrach and Pvt. Wilson demonstrated in their roles as soldiers for the Union,\" Hobson said. \"In a time when we see so much divisiveness, the bipartisan commitment to do the right thing and honor these two soldiers with the Medal of Honor can hopefully remind us of the value of national unity and that when we come together as Americans, we can do anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType":

Austin III at the Medal of Honor Hall of Heroes Induction (As delivered)", "body": "Well, good morning. And happy Fourth of July!\n\nIt is indeed an honor to welcome you to the Hall of Heroes.\n\nSecretary Wormuth, General George: Thanks for your moving words. And along with Sergeant Major of the Army Weimer, thanks for leading the United States Army with such skill and professionalism.\n\nI'm also pleased to see so many outstanding Department of Defense and Army leaders with us today.\n\nAnd let me also thank our honored guests today: the families of Private Philip Shadrach and Private George Wilson. You are the bridge back to their bravery. You carry their legacy. And we're deeply grateful to have you here.\n\nIt's a huge honor to hold this ceremony on Independence Day. Every Fourth of July, we celebrate our founding values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And by gathering today, we remind ourselves of how much it took to turn those principles into human government.\n\nJust a few generations after we won our freedom from the British crown, our new republic was ripped apart. In his Independence Day message in 1861, President Lincoln said that our American experiment was struggling against those who fought to put \"an end to free government upon the earth.\"\n\nAnd we have gathered to salute two of the bravest soldiers ever to fight for free government: Private Shadrach and Private Wilson.\n\nIn 1862, as you've heard, the civilian scout James J. Andrews convinced the commander of the Union forces in central Tennessee to try to steal a train and use it to rip up the railroad behind it and cut off the rebels' ability to resupply their forces from Atlanta. The men we honor today raised their hands for that stunning raid.\n\nOne comrade remembered that Private Shadrach was \"solidly built, merry and reckless, with an inexhaustible store of good nature.\" Yet his brothers in arms could count on him, as one said, to \"sacrifice anything for a friend.\"\n\nOther soldiers said that Private Wilson was \"tall and spare, with high cheek-bones [and] sharp gray eyes.\" And his battle buddies felt from him \"a greatness of soul which sympathized intensely with our struggle for national life.\"\n\nOn April 12, Private Shadrach, Private Wilson, and the rest of the Andrews Raiders set off. They were outnumbered, out-gunned, and far behind enemy lines. But when the time came, they seized the locomotive from under the noses of the Confederate troops.\n\n\"It was a painfully thrilling moment,\" one of the raidersrecalled. \"We were but twenty, with an army about us, and a long difficult road before us, crowded with enemies.\"\n\nSo they sped away. Racing against their pursuers. Racing against time. And racing against fate.\n\nThe Union raiders tore up the tracks behind them. They ripped down the telegraph cables above them. And they damaged key transportation and communications lines. But the raiders soon ran out of fuel -- and out of luck.\n\nPrivate Shadrach and Private Wilson were among the first to be captured. And a Confederate military court sentenced them to hang.\n\nPrivate Shadrach told his fellow prisoners that he sought comfort in his faith. Private Wilson's thoughts also turned to his trust in God -- and to his belief in America.\n\nOne account says that Wilson was \"surrounded by a scowling crowd.\" But he spoke to them while standing under the gallows. And Private Wilson told that angry crowd that \"they would yet see the time when the old Union would be restored,and when its flag would wave over them again.\"\n\nAnd he was right. And on this Fourth of July, our flag still waves over the free citizens of the United States of America.\n\nAnd as you've heard, nearly a year after the Andrews Raid, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton welcomed the surviving raiders to Washington. And he presented them with a newly created award for valor, making them the first U.S. Service members to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nToday, more than 160 years later, we complete that arc of history. And we link the first recipients of the Medal of Honor to the newest recipients of the Medal of Honor. The names of Private Philip Shadrach and Private George Wilson will be inscribed forever in the Hall of Heroes alongside their fellow raiders.\n\nTheir medals are new. Yet their bravery is eternal.\n\nOn this Independence Day, their story reminds us of the American patriots who risked everything for our freedom, and for our Union, and for our future of liberty under law. Their story doesn't just inspire us. It challenges us.\n\nSo we are not just here to honor their sacrifice. We are here to live up to their example.\n\nDemocracy is a daily referendum. It is not just the consequence of grand actions, but the sum of small decisions. And that's true every day -- and not just on the Fourth of July.\n\n\"Democracy is never a thing done,\" an American poet once wrote. \"Democracy is always something that a nation must be doing.\"\n\nSo it is always the right time to salute America's independence. It is always the right time to reaffirm America's values.

Philip G. Shadrach and George D. Wilson, Biden also celebrated them and their comrades for sticking to their mission even as the odds of victory diminished before their eyes.\n\n\"George and Phillip and the rest of the raiders didn't quit,\" the president said. \"They kept going nearly for seven hours, destroying as much track as they could along the way and cutting as many telegraph wires as they could.\"\n\nBiden said the group almost made it to the Tennessee border before Confederate soldiers caught up with them. And many survived in the forest for up to two weeks before they were captured.\n\nThe president lately has been facing his own test of fortitude, resisting calls for him to abandon his campaign for a second term in office after a dismal performance at last week's debate in Atlanta. But he has said he has no plans to step aside.\n\nDuring his remarks at Wednesday's ceremony, Biden made a note that Wilson was a \"hell of a debater.\"\n\n\"He always was ready to persuade, argue and, as one family member put it, dress anyone down if need be,\" the president said.\n\nBiden described Shadrach as a \"free spirit, always searching for adventure, excitement and trade.\"\n\nTeresa Chandler, a great-great-granddaughter of Wilson, accepted the award on his behalf. Shadrach's great-grandnephew Gerald Taylor was the one who received his award.\n\nBiden said the families had told him how they had passed down the stories about their ancestors and the Great Locomotive Chase through the generations.\n\nThe men were taken to a Confederate prison and chained by their necks and wrists, Biden said. Eventually, they were publicly hanged but stayed true to their belief of a united America until the end.\n\nRemember that commitment to democracy and freedom is worth noting as the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day, Biden said.\n\n\"Their heroic deeds went unacknowledged for over a century, but time did not erase their valor,\" he said. \"And what they fought for and died for is just as precious today as it was then.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Philip Gephart Shadrach and Pvt. George Davenport Wilson. The pair were part of a Union Army contingent that stole a Confederate train during the war in what became known as the \"Great Locomotive Chase.\"\n\nEach soldier's oldest living relative accepted the award during Wednesday's ceremony.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN HAS MAJOR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AS TOP ADVISER TO THE MAN WHO COULD PARDON HIM\n\nSeated in the audience was the president's son, who was convicted in June of making a false statement in the purchase of a gun, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed gun dealer, and possession of a gun by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.\n\nBiden lied on a federal form when he was asked if he was an unlawful user of a firearm or addicted to controlled substances while trying to purchase a firearm from a Delaware gun shop.\n\nHe has long been a target for Republicans because of his checkered past and possible influence within his father's administration. More recently, House Republicans were upset over reported revelations he has been sitting in on President Biden's White House meetings in recent days.\n\nRep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., called Hunter Biden \"a walking national security threat.\"\n\n\"He's raked in more than $20 million from foreign entities, including the CCP, for the Biden [family].

Andrews, a Kentucky-born civilian spy and scout.

{"id": 232082676, "title": "What Modi 3.0 means for New India", "text": "With the oath-taking ceremony of Modi 3.0, one can sense the maturing of our democracy. The last decade of the Modi-led government saw institutional and economic development and a culture of inclusive governance \u2014 sabka saath sabka vikas sabka vishwas. With his focus on GYAN (Garib, Yuva, Annadata, Nari Shakti), PM Modi showed that he is the flagbearer of growth, youth development, gender equality and nation-building. The Weberian concept of \u201ccharismatic authority\u201d is particularly apt in PM Modi\u2019s context. Under his leadership, the BJP fostered the idea of one nation and strengthened nationalism by imbibing a deep sense of patriotism in citizens. Various local factors are responsible for cultivating among Dalits a bias towards the BJP, but Modi\u2019s image is central to the admiration they have for the party. This election was popularly referred to as \u201cModi ka election\u201d \u2014 he is seen to be more popular and identifiable than the BJP symbol of the lotus, especially in rural India. His focus on stability, development, and progress \u2014 the \u201cModi Guarantee\u201d \u2014 acquired people\u2019s faith. Through exemplary initiatives like the Panchteerth of Babasaheb, our PM has honoured the legacy of B R Ambedkar. This is not a mere opinion; the support for the BJP among the Dalit communities in our country has seen a massive rise, from 24 per cent votes in 2014 to 36 per cent votes in 2019. Under Modi, social harmony and unity, ideology over identity, and conviction over hollow promises have taken precedence. This marks a historic shift in Dalit politics. The PM fought the election with his track record in infrastructure building, investment, innovation, and inclusiveness. From the country becoming a major exporter of toys to being on the cusp of developing indigenous semiconductor chips, the Make in India initiative is ushering Bharat towards a new level of atma nirbharta by making the country a global manufacturing hub. The major beneficiaries of industrialisation are now women and youth, of which Dalits constitute a major chunk. The manufacturing boom is likely to pave the way for uplifting millions of Dalits and backward classes into a new middle class. Socio-economic indicators suggest that despite reservation in education, a significant chunk of backward communities, Dalits, Adivasis and minorities still fall short of university degrees, making them ineligible for the service industry. However, the manufacturing upsurge has led to higher employment, particularly for the marginalised. PM Modi will inevitably be compared to our First Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. However, this is a different era \u2014 one of assertive aspirational India, looking to thrive not just survive. Re-electing a Prime Minister during an era of war and economic instability is one thing and re-electing a Prime Minister in an era when India is at peace with its neighbours and its growth story is touching new heights is another. History will accord Modi a prominent place in the list of all those who ushered India to new heights. Modi\u2019s tenure is packed with action-oriented politics rather than rhetoric. He metamorphosed vote-bank politics into GYAN pillars. There has been a systematic shift in the thinking of voters, not just in urban areas but also in rural areas \u2014 they are able to sift through rhetoric and fear-mongering and focus on real issues. This election, mahila matters have eclipsed caste and communal flux. An outstanding 64.95 per cent women stepped out and voted. This can be attributed not only to awareness of schemes but also the increased know-how on how to access them. The nation\u2019s active engagement in global politics is also shaping the internal political landscape. The expected outcome of this verdict will aid in concretising the dominance of our country as \u201cvishwa guru\u201d. The common voters want to know what\u2019s going on in the global front. The outreach of the G20 summit has made them aware of the world beyond India and her status in the global scheme of things. India\u2019s global image was never a poll plank in her 75-year history. From being the fourth nation to land a lunar probe to being responsible for the African Union\u2019s entry into G20 to nurturing a growing economy while global economic powers teetered, India\u2019s growing stature became a poll issue in this election. The 2024 elections voiced the aspirations of the voters, defining what they want from the government and their equal stake in its formation. As we usher in a new era of the politics of consensus, the role of the government will be to ensure that the ideals, interest and inclusion of the marginalised are brought to the fore. It will be a welcome and much-awaited move.

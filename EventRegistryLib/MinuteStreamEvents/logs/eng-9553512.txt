This is very important and he has done well, not only for the judiciary but for the entire nation.\n\n\"Mr. President, by the nature of the judicial officers, they don't agitate. They cry in silence, and they don't speak out. Other workers agitate, and they stage protests. But the judiciary doesn't talk; they cry in silence.\n\n\"Now, the president of the country has spoken for them. What he did is something laudable and we are applauding him here. Because a country that didn't take its judiciary in a very important passion is doomed.\n\n\"And when you want to take the judiciary seriously, you have to take the remuneration of the judiciary staff seriously. That is very important, and that is what he has done. They have stagnated for several years.\n\nRead Also: Senate moves to amend 59-year-old ICAN Act\n\n\"What the president has done should be supported and we will give him more support to continue to work on this kind of trajectory for the development of the nation. So, Mr. President, I joined you and other colleagues to commend President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\"\n\nSenator Mohammed Monguno (APC - Borno North) Monguno, said improving the welfare of judges will insulate them from corruption and ensure they deliver just and fair judgments.\n\nOn his part, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (APC-Abia North), said: \"No right-thinking Nigerian will not think that it is right to keep the judiciary comfortable. I want to thank the executive for deeming it fit to increase the salaries of judges at all levels.\"\n\nSenators later approved that the bill be read for a second time when it was put to voice vote by Akpabio.\n\nAkpabio thereafter referred the Bill to the Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, and Legal Matters for further legislative input and to report back in four weeks.", "source": {"uri":

The issue of salary administration needs not be brought to Parliament for debate.\n\n\"We need to fix a clause that says, provided that every year, within that law, there should be a provision of appropriate organs to review and take into account the rate of inflation and adjust the wages of both Chief Judge of the Federation and all the judges that are covered by this act.\"\n\nAlso in his contribution, Senate Minority Leader, Senator Abba Moro, PDP, Benue South said, \" I am not against this bill, but I think it is germane that we do something about it. Judiciary is the last hope of the common man. Given the rate of present inflation and to ensure that our Judicial officers are not allowed to fall into temptation, it is good. I suggest that Mr. President be allowed to gauge the mood of the workers.\"\n\nOn his part, the Deputy Senate President, Senator Barau Jibrin, APC, Kano North said, \" they don't cry out, can't agitate like other workers..They have been crying in silence. we take the judiciary seriously, we must also take their remuneration seriously.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the Senate, Senator Godswill Akpabio said that the President has the prerogative to do that, depending on the rate of inflation.", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors":

This will insulate judicial officers from corruption and give them the courage to deliver judgments that are just and fair,\" Monguno said.\n\nIn his submission, Orji Kalu (APC, Abia North) said increasing the salaries of the judges is the right thing to do.\n\n\"No right-thinking Nigerian will think that it is right to keep the judiciary comfortable. I want to thank the executive for deeming it fit to increase the salaries of judges at all levels. We should not stop at the judiciary but look at other sectors of the economy,\" he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Emmanuel Udende (APC, Benue North-East) noted that judges have not been able to do much in the past few years due to poor pay.\n\n\"For the past 15 years, judicial officers have remained on meagre salaries. When you interact with them as a lawyer, you will see their morale is dampened, and when morale is dampened, the work will be difficult,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dirisu_yakubu@punchng.com", "name": "Dirisu Yakubu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwara_South_Senatorial_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kwara South Senatorial District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lola_Ashiru", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lola Ashiru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monguno", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monguno"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abia_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abia State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abia State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benue_North-East_Senatorial_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benue North-East Senatorial District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/27141515/Senate-in-session.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553512", "eventUri": "eng-9553512", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

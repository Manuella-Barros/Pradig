The new uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) is on the ballot papers in the upcoming national election and provincial elections.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that the upstart will worsen the electoral woes of the ruling ANC in Zuma's heartland, KwaZulu-Natal province. The ANC, which has governed the country since 1994, goes into the elections uncertain about securing the more than 50% majority needed to form a government. We asked political scientist Mashupye H. Maserumule for his insights on the MK Party.\n\ntransform South Africa into a beacon of equality, prosperity and sustainability.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this. Firstly, it's what almost all parties promise. And the MK Party doesn't have a coherent policy on how to realise this vision, let alone a clear ideological position to distinguish itself from other political parties.\n\nSecondly, the party has adopted incendiary rhetoric, tinged with populist extremism. For example, it talks about doing away with the supremacy of the country's constitution and replacing it with \"unfettered\" parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nThis is troubling because South Africa has been on a path of establishing a constitutional democracy based on a set of essential rights for its citizens since its first democratic elections in 1994. It's also undesirable because parliament ruled supreme under apartheid, passing unjust laws that oppressed the majority black population.\n\nRead more: South Africa's constitution was set up as the bedrock of its democracy: it's been challenged over last 30 years, but has held firm\n\nThe party also promises to incorporate traditional leadership in the country's parliamentary system. This is not necessarily to be frowned upon, but it has the potential to upend the country's constitutional democracy. For, in this system of managing public affairs, the rule of law lies with the constitution.\n\nUniversity of Johannesburg political scientist Siphamandla Zondi sees the MK Party as\n\njust another faction of the ANC that has decided to operate from outside the ANC.\n\nZuma's almost two-decades-old corruption charges related to the 1999 arms deal - to acquire and upgrade the post-apartheid military's equipment - are still hovering over his head and he continues to be in and out of court. He is hoping to win a two-thirds majority to change the constitution, and give himself the power to override the court process. He pits the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution against traditional leadership.\n\nWhat lies behind the MK Party's formation?\n\nThe MK Party was launched on 16 December 2023 in Soweto. It was at this event that Zuma announced his association with it. He has since emerged as its leader and has been campaigning vigorously for it as its public face.\n\nRead more: The two faces of Jacob Zuma - former South African president campaigns to unseat the ANC he once led. Who supports him and why?\n\nThe MK Party's formation is linked to Zuma's longstanding grievance against the ANC. That came to a head following his arrest and incarceration on 7 July 2021 for refusing to appear before the State Capture Commission. He had defied the order of the Constitutional Court to do so and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n\nMore than six decades later Zuma's MK Party argues that the ANC cannot claim exclusivity to the MK name as its creation. For its part, the ANC has claimed that MK is inextricably linked to the ANC.\n\nRead more: How Pentecostalism explains Jacob Zuma's defiance and lack of shame\n\nThe ANC tried to stop the MK party from using the name uMkhonto weSizwe and trademark or anything similar to it. It argued that the use of the logo constituted a breach of the country's Trade Marks Act. But the High Court dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was mulling appealing the case at the time of writing.\n\nWhat are the MK Party's prospects?\n\nOpinion polls predict that the MK Party is likely to get 8.4% of the national vote.\n\nThat would make it the fourth biggest party in South Africa - after the ANC, Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters.

The new uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) is on the ballot papers in the upcoming national election and provincial elections.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that the upstart will worsen the electoral woes of the ruling ANC in Zuma's heartland, KwaZulu-Natal province. The ANC, which has governed the country since 1994, goes into the elections uncertain about securing the more than 50% majority needed to form a government. We asked political scientist Mashupye H. Maserumule for his insights on the MK Party.\n\ntransform South Africa into a beacon of equality, prosperity and sustainability.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this. Firstly, it's what almost all parties promise. And the MK Party doesn't have a coherent policy on how to realise this vision, let alone a clear ideological position to distinguish itself from other political parties.\n\nSecondly, the party has adopted incendiary rhetoric, tinged with populist extremism. For example, it talks about doing away with the supremacy of the country's constitution and replacing it with \"unfettered\" parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nThis is troubling because South Africa has been on a path of establishing a constitutional democracy based on a set of essential rights for its citizens since its first democratic elections in 1994. It's also undesirable because parliament ruled supreme under apartheid, passing unjust laws that oppressed the majority black population.\n\nThe party also promises to incorporate traditional leadership in the country's parliamentary system. This is not necessarily to be frowned upon, but it has the potential to upend the country's constitutional democracy. For, in this system of managing public affairs, the rule of law lies with the constitution.\n\nUniversity of Johannesburg political scientist Siphamandla Zondi sees the MK Party as\n\njust another faction of the ANC that has decided to operate from outside the ANC.\n\nZuma's almost two-decades-old corruption charges related to the 1999 arms deal - to acquire and upgrade the post-apartheid military's equipment - are still hovering over his head and he continues to be in and out of court. He is hoping to win a two-thirds majority to change the constitution, and give himself the power to override the court process. He pits the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution against traditional leadership.\n\nWhat lies behind the MK Party's formation?\n\nThe MK Party was launched on 16 December 2023 in Soweto. It was at this event that Zuma announced his association with it. He has since emerged as its leader and has been campaigning vigorously for it as its public face.\n\nThe MK Party's formation is linked to Zuma's longstanding grievance against the ANC. That came to a head following his arrest and incarceration on 7 July 2021 for refusing to appear before the State Capture Commission. He had defied the order of the Constitutional Court to do so and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n\nMore than six decades later Zuma's MK Party argues that the ANC cannot claim exclusivity to the MK name as its creation. For its part, the ANC has claimed that MK is inextricably linked to the ANC.\n\nThe ANC tried to stop the MK party from using the name uMkhonto weSizwe and trademark or anything similar to it. It argued that the use of the logo constituted a breach of the country's Trade Marks Act. But the High Court dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was mulling appealing the case at the time of writing.\n\nWhat are the MK Party's prospects?\n\nOpinion polls predict that the MK Party is likely to get 8.4% of the national vote.\n\nThat would make it the fourth biggest party in South Africa - after the ANC, Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters. It is also expected to get more than 30% of the provincial vote in KwaZulu-Natal, making it a major party in Zuma's home province.\n\nIts biggest existential threat is Zuma (82) himself. The party is personalised around him. It may not have any political future without him given that it is relying heavily on the euphoria Zuma engenders by using Zulu ethno-nationalism and populist rhetoric.\n\nMashupye Herbert Maserumule received funding for his PhD studies from National Research Foundation(NRF).

A plethora of opinion polls published so far have shown congruent and conflicting projections.\n\nOpinion polling is a crucial barometer for electoral purposes because it provides valuable anecdotal evidence. A majority of projections currently suggest that the governing African National Congress (ANC) may lose its parliamentary majority for the first time.\n\nNearly 28 million eligible voters are poised to participate in this year's elections. According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), 55 percent of registered voters are female. Over 45 parties are contesting the elections.\n\nThe elections come at a time when South Africa, a regional powerhouse, has been experiencing and undergoing turbulent political and socio-economic routines, dramatically shifting the support base of the governing ANC party.\n\nA closer evaluation of the ANC's support, in power since 1994, shows that Africa's oldest revolutionary party has been losing at least four percentage points of its support from elections since 2004. In 1994, it won with a 62,6 percent margin; 66,4 percent in 1999 and its highest victory margin of 69,7 percent came in 2004.\n\nSince the 2009 elections, the party's support base has been shaky. In that year's election it won with 65,9 percent, a nearly five percent drop from the 2004 elections; 62,2 percent in 2014 and 57,5 percent in the 2019 elections.\n\nThe biggest threat to the ANC, according to a recent poll by the Social Research Foundation, is former president Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party in his home province of KwaZulu Natal. The MK is expected to siphon support from the ANC and in that province it is projected to garner 26 percent of support, ahead of ANC's 25 percent.\n\nLast week, the ANC brought in political heavyweights in its campaign in the form of former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Kaglema Mothlante and former vice president, David Mabuza to reinforce its presence.\n\nInterestingly, besides political rhetoric, both the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) parties are not capitalising on this dramatic decline of ANC support.\n\nBut to win in politics, political parties need to maximise their ability to earn more political capital than opponents.\n\nThe Multi-Party Charter, a coalition of eight parties with a collective 112 of the 400 seats in the national assembly, is looking forward to getting a chunk of the electorate.\n\nThis drop in support for the ANC gives indications about the attitudes of the electorate towards the party in the post-apartheid era, which has been littered with unfulfilled promises and broken commitments.\n\nThe elections are coming amid rising dissatisfaction by the black majority's failure to own means of production, are landless, experiencing high levels of unemployment and job inequality and power generation subdued.\n\nProspects of equality for the majority black South Africans are taking long to be realised. The ANC says it is working to fix the problems. The challenges are huge but not insurmountable. Corruption in private and the public sector, high crime rates where least 130 cases of rape and an average 84 murders happen daily are some of the challenges confronting the ANC government.\n\nPossible election outcomes\n\nThe DA, EFF and Multi-Party Charter are unlikely going to have outright majority wins. Amongst the three political entities, though in the opposition, they do not share similar ideological orientations, hence their credibility test is questionable.\n\nBased on current polls, the most likely scenario is that the ANC is either going to lose its absolute majority in parliament or will scrap a slim majority victory. In the event of losing its majority, it will join forces with smaller, primarily centrist parties to form a coalition in exchange for policy concessions.\n\nThe EFF is also thought to be a likely outfit to enter into coalition with the ANC, but the South African economy has already responded negatively to an ostensible coalition of the two.\n\nAsset allocators have started hedging against a potential ANC-EFF coalition, scared that such a government union could result in capital outflows, damagingly impacting investor sentiment.\n\nThe ANC and the EFF have already shown that they can work together. Last November, the ANC parliamentarians joined the EFF in their proposal to have the Israeli embassy in SA closed amid that country's war with Hamas in Gaza. The EFF also supported the ANC government when it raised a case of genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza by the Israeli government in January.\n\nSecondly, any potential coalition will place the ANC at the centre of policy making to give meaningful improvements to where the party has failed and return to the 1994 values it was committed to. A coalition government led by the ANC is unlikely to disrupt the continuity of energy policy, justice for the people of Palestine and continued efforts to meet the people's demands.\n\nEver hopeful ANC\n\nThe ANC knows that its house is not as orderly as it should be, but it's wearing a brave face. The rise of the MK has been dismissed by the ANC as a non-event and not \"formidable\" compared to the Congress of the People (Cope).\n\nThe Cope, a breakaway faction from the ANC, was founded in December 2008 ahead of the 2009 elections and won 30 parliamentary seats. Yet, the rise of MK might indicate a turning point for the ANC, which is giving emphasis that the people must vote with Palestine and 1994 in mind.\n\nThe impact of the 1994 election moment in South Africa must not be under-estimated. It brought to people a relief after years of colonialism and apartheid, to give legitimacy to the majority of the black majority that was led by the ANC.\n\nWith political swings moving fast, it remains to be seen how the ANC will give direction to its members in anticipation of being the next government. The revolutionary party has remained hopeful even when facing the threat of external besmirch by the USA that it was supplying weapons of war to Russia.", "source": {"uri": "chronicle.co.zw",

The new uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) is on the ballot papers in the upcoming national election and provincial elections.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that the upstart will worsen the electoral woes of the ruling ANC in Zuma's heartland, KwaZulu-Natal province. The ANC, which has governed the country since 1994, goes into the elections uncertain about securing the more than 50% majority needed to form a government. We asked political scientist Mashupye H. Maserumule for his insights on the MK Party.\n\ntransform South Africa into a beacon of equality, prosperity and sustainability.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this. Firstly, it's what almost all parties promise. And the MK Party doesn't have a coherent policy on how to realise this vision, let alone a clear ideological position to distinguish itself from other political parties.\n\nSecondly, the party has adopted incendiary rhetoric, tinged with populist extremism. For example, it talks about doing away with the supremacy of the country's constitution and replacing it with \"unfettered\" parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nThis is troubling because South Africa has been on a path of establishing a constitutional democracy based on a set of essential rights for its citizens since its first democratic elections in 1994. It's also undesirable because parliament ruled supreme under apartheid, passing unjust laws that oppressed the majority black population.\n\nRead more: South Africa's constitution was set up as the bedrock of its democracy: it's been challenged over last 30 years, but has held firm\n\nThe party also promises to incorporate traditional leadership in the country's parliamentary system. This is not necessarily to be frowned upon, but it has the potential to upend the country's constitutional democracy. For, in this system of managing public affairs, the rule of law lies with the constitution.\n\nUniversity of Johannesburg political scientist Siphamandla Zondi sees the MK Party as\n\njust another faction of the ANC that has decided to operate from outside the ANC.\n\nZuma's almost two-decades-old corruption charges related to the 1999 arms deal - to acquire and upgrade the post-apartheid military's equipment - are still hovering over his head and he continues to be in and out of court. He is hoping to win a two-thirds majority to change the constitution, and give himself the power to override the court process. He pits the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution against traditional leadership.\n\nWhat lies behind the MK Party's formation?\n\nThe MK Party was launched on 16 December 2023 in Soweto. It was at this event that Zuma announced his association with it. He has since emerged as its leader and has been campaigning vigorously for it as its public face.\n\nRead more: The two faces of Jacob Zuma - former South African president campaigns to unseat the ANC he once led. Who supports him and why?\n\nThe MK Party's formation is linked to Zuma's longstanding grievance against the ANC. That came to a head following his arrest and incarceration on 7 July 2021 for refusing to appear before the State Capture Commission. He had defied the order of the Constitutional Court to do so and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n\nMore than six decades later Zuma's MK Party argues that the ANC cannot claim exclusivity to the MK name as its creation. For its part, the ANC has claimed that MK is inextricably linked to the ANC.\n\nRead more: How Pentecostalism explains Jacob Zuma's defiance and lack of shame\n\nThe ANC tried to stop the MK party from using the name uMkhonto weSizwe and trademark or anything similar to it. It argued that the use of the logo constituted a breach of the country's Trade Marks Act. But the High Court dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was mulling appealing the case at the time of writing.\n\nWhat are the MK Party's prospects?\n\nOpinion polls predict that the MK Party is likely to get 8.4% of the national vote.\n\nThat would make it the fourth biggest party in South Africa - after the ANC, Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters. It is also expected to get more than 30% of the provincial vote in KwaZulu-Natal, making it a major party in Zuma's home province.\n\nRead more: Jacob Zuma likes to be cast as a man of the people - but is he?\n\nIts biggest existential threat is Zuma (82) himself. The party is personalised around him. It may not have any political future without him given that it is relying heavily on the euphoria Zuma engenders by using Zulu ethno-nationalism and populist rhetoric.\n\nThe young party is already racked by factionalism, power struggles and leadership purges.\n\n- South Africa elections: Zuma's MK Party has hit the campaign trail with provocative rhetoric and few clear policies\n\n-

For others, he is corrupt and ill-fit to lead.\n\nDespite having been at the forefront of some of the worst corruption and mismanagement scandals in post-apartheid history, the 82-year-old has returned to the political spotlight time and again.\n\nNow, ahead of general elections on May 29, Zuma has turned his back on the African National Congress (ANC) - the party that made him a two-time president between 2009 and 2018 - in favour of newcomers, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), that seek to challenge the governing party's hold on power.\n\nMultiple polls have predicted the ANC will lose its parliamentary majority for the first time since the fall of apartheid in 1994, and likely have to rule as part of a coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, the MK has been gaining in the polls, even threatening to take voters from other opposition parties. This has led some analysts to suggest Zuma may be in a position to be kingmaker - with the MK possibly becoming the majority party in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).\n\nPolitical commentator Justice Malala, writing in a column last month, said \"Zuma has been winning the public relations war against the ANC at every turn\", and argued that the MK's dominance in KZN may put the former leader in a kingmaker position in national coalition talks.\n\nIf the ANC does as poorly as expected, Malala argued, it may have to form a coalition with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the MK, which could lead Zuma to once again take on an influential role in government.\n\nOther analysts echo similar sentiments. Some, however, are less convinced that the former leader has enough widespread support.\n\n\"[Zuma] is a powerful brand and has impact and influence because he was in the ANC for so long,\" independent political analyst Asanda Ngoasheng told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"Many will be shocked at how the power diminishes the minute you are no longer in the ANC.\"\n\nZuma, who resigned as president in 2018 after corruption allegations and was replaced by current President Cyril Ramaphosa, remained a loyal member of the ANC until December 2023 when he declared he would back the MK instead of the ANC in the 2024 polls.\n\nZuma has since become the face of the MK, with the party using his mass popularity to win more voters.\n\nStill, many question how much practical power and influence Zuma and the MK have.\n\n\"The political landscape in South Africa is undergoing significant shifts,\" market research firm Ipsos said in a recent report.\n\nThe latest Ipsos poll, conducted through face-to-face interviews across all nine provinces in March and April, found that the ANC is losing support (polling at 40 percent, down from 43 percent six months ago), while Zuma's party is on the rise, even though its vote share is still small.\n\nThe MK is also taking voters from other main opposition parties, the EFF and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the latter of which has traditionally been a strong contender in KZN.\n\n\"The emergence of MK has halted the advances made by the EFF in recent years, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal, with some former EFF supporters migrating to the new party that polled at just over 8%,\" said Ipsos.\n\n\"As the campaign enters its final weeks, uncertainty is highest in KwaZulu-Natal, where almost a fifth of the electorate has not yet decided which party or candidate they will vote for,\" Ipsos added.\n\nSeveral ANC insiders Al Jazeera spoke to said they know the MK is making serious inroads in KZN, and coupled with the strong rural vote that the IFP has historically won there, they do face an \"uphill\" battle.\n\nThey were also aware the Zuma factor was going to eat into the ANC's voter share. Nevertheless, they continue to actively campaign in the province, even sending President Ramaphosa to campaign there in late April.\n\n\"The MK party is potentially a threat to the ANC but I don't think it's necessarily the threat to the size or magnitude that everyone is making it out to be,\" Ngoasheng told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The ANC has had multiple political parties and breakaway parties out of it; the Pan Africanist Congress in the 1960s is one of the oldest breakaway parties; then there was Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters.\"\n\nThe analyst argued therefore that it was \"not the first time that someone has gone off to start their own political party and so, like all the others, Zuma will pull some support from the ANC but it won't be the thing that breaks the ANC\".\n\nMany ask the question, \"What does Zuma want?\", wondering why a former president with lifetime benefits from the state would be interested in contesting an election and going up against his political home of more than 60 years. The answer to that has its roots in Zuma's home province.\n\nKZN has more than 5.7 million registered voters and is where Zuma's political base is. Gauteng and KZN, with 23.6 percent and 20.7 percent of the electorate, respectively, will, according to political analysts and pollsters, once again be the key provinces to watch in this election.\n\nAdditionally, the province is a strategic one for Zuma as some analysts say he may be seeking to use it to protect his legacy and ensure his continued political influence in the country.\n\nAlthough the ANC has won KZN in the last four elections, the kind of unpredictability that exists this year harkens back to the first democratic elections when the IFP and ANC were both vying for control.\n\nDuring the 1990s, political violence between the IFP and ANC supporters engulfed the province and the IFP initially refused to participate in the 1994 elections. Only at the last minute did they decide to contest, eventually winning KZN.\n\nThe lingering effects of this violence still impact the province today, with tensions occasionally resurfacing between the two parties.\n\n\"Those moments of uncertainty of 1994 ... are coming back to the fray this time around KZN,\" said Sanusha Naidu, a political analyst from the Institute for Global Dialogue.\n\n\"You have instability and unpredictability and that is why we cannot predict this election and at the end of the day, whatever happens at the provincial level will have dire consequences and significant implications for the way the national coalition and architecture will be defined.\"\n\nNaidu said KZN is almost like a problem child-problem province for the ANC.\n\n\"In the 1990s, Zuma was pivotal to those negotiations with the Inkatha Freedom Party, IFP, and he was, in some ways, seen as the person who played a significant role in negotiating and an incredible and important interlocker for the ANC.\"\n\nThis election, Zuma and his MK supporters say they have \"unfinished business\" and want to return to power to ensure delivery for the poorest of the poor in the country.\n\nHowever, despite much speculation about the MK's potential impact in the polls, it remains to be seen how the party will fare. Some analysts told Al Jazeera it is simply too difficult to call at this stage.\n\nBut what is clear is that the rift between Zuma and the ANC will not be repaired overnight. MK members told Al Jazeera they feel Zuma has been treated \"badly and disrespected\" by the ANC and this is likely to play a role in how MK will handle any coalition talks.\n\nMK members told Al Jazeera it was too soon to talk about coalition talks as they were focused on winning KZN. However, they did acknowledge that Zuma's treatment by the ANC would influence their approach.\n\nAmong voters in KZN, Zuma maintains a strong and loyal support base of people who also share dissatisfaction with the ANC.\n\nPensioner Michael Nxasana, 63, said issues like the constant water cuts, potholes and corruption led him to join the MK, which he believes offers solutions as they prioritise service delivery and accountability.\n\n\"The ANC comrades are thieves, they must go, there is too much corruption, they must be voted out and we are going to show the ANC. Those ones they can forget about winning the election,\" he told Al Jazeera in the city of Pietermaritzburg.\n\n\"Zuma is a good man and he's disciplined and we are disciplined; we know he wasn't perfect but who is? The ANC's days are numbered. JZ [Jacob Zuma] loves our people and we are his people ... Everyone here is going to vote for the MK.\"\n\nAlthough Zuma is \"portrayed in a very negative way\", said Faizel Moosa, an MK member in the Western Cape, \"if we look at the facts, Comrade Zuma, President Zuma did quite a lot for South Africa\".\n\n\"He was not allowed to complete what he wanted to do and he is now wanting to come back and we support him,\" Moosa said. \"Some call it wasted years but we don't think it was wasted at all and was productive and we want to complete what he started.\"\n\nAnalyst Ngoasheng, however, said the facts do not support Moosa's claims.\n\n\"He has a track record as having been the one president of the country who presided over wide-scale looting and what a lot of his supporters do not realise is that a lot of the current struggles are because of his widespread looting, or the challenges of blackouts are because of the looting.\n\n\"They are not linking all of this to our current state in the country.\"\n\nNgoasheng is not convinced Zuma will be good for South Africa and believes his leadership style is outdated and regressive, particularly when it comes to gender equality and societal progress.\n\nShe fears Zuma's tendency to play the victim - as he has done numerous times since being fired as deputy president under President Thabo Mbeki in 2005 - may hinder the country's advancement and perpetuate harmful ideologies.\n\n\"He gets away with the victim mentality and blames Ramaphosa for his own failings and the ANC has shot itself in the foot; they supported him for so long, no matter how unethical or corrupt he was,\" Ngoasheng added.\n\nNow, with Zuma poised to play a big role in yet another election cycle, his supporters are with him all the way, while those reeling from the effects of his last term in office are nervous at the prospect of having him in a position of power yet again.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You must always believe in the ANC and stay with your organisation. Do not lose hope in the ANC. Those who left the ANC will still come back, they don't know where they are going,\" Mbalula said.\n\nWhile Mbalula works the province's only metro, ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe has been deployed to work the far north of KwaZulu-Natal, where a fierce battle at the polls with the IFP is expected.\n\nANC first deputy secretary general Nomvula Mokonyane leads the campaign in the

Several years earlier, in 1990, shortly after his release from prison, Mandela visited the United States, where he met with cheers from the thousands of supporters who came to pay their respects to the revolutionary freedom fighter.\n\nThen and now, Mandela and the ANC have been widely hailed as the heirs to a decades-long anti-apartheid struggle. But this legacy, one claimed by many ANC leaders themselves, was not a foregone conclusion. Throughout its century-long history, the ANC worked with and also jostled for political space alongside other movements, organizations, and individuals, each with their own vision of liberation. More recently the party has faced competition from other organizations and movements, including the Economic Freedom Fighters, whose recent electoral success has threatened the ANC's majority. Defeating Apartheid and fending off challenges has frequently necessitated forging alliances. Some of the partners sought out by the ANC on its journey from revolutionary movement to governing power, including with American media and US corporations, have been more surprising than others and raise questions about the ANC's claim as the primary heir to the anti-apartheid struggle.\n\nSince its founding in 1912, the ANC (originally named the South African Native National Congress) has maintained ties with other organizations based outside South Africa. One of the earliest connections made by the ANC was with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), whose charter served as inspiration for the ANC's charter. Such connections proved crucial in generating international support for the ANC and the anti-apartheid struggle. Shortly after the ANC's banning in 1960, the NAACP called for a boycott of South African goods. The NAACP later expanded its call to include all US investments and loans to South Africa, urging the US government \"to sever all economic, diplomatic, military, and cultural relationships with the racist regimes of Portugal, Rhodesia, and South Africa, and . . . extend recognition and aid to the . . . liberation movements of these areas.\"\n\nNAACP support notwithstanding, over the years, the ANC struggled to maintain support among Black Americans amid a rapidly changing domestic and global political landscape. Recalling an encounter with a Black American cab driver in New York City in 1974, ANC ambassador to the United Nations Johnny Makatini noted \"the cabby realized his passenger wasn't from the US, and asked where he was from.\" An elated Makatini, who believed Black Americans would \"constitute a natural ally\" for the ANC began exclaiming about the ANC's recent victory to expel South Africa from the UN. The cabby, however, interrupted him, saying, \"No, I don't agree with the communists,\" referring to the ANC. The exchange, while hardly representative of Black Americans, who held wide-ranging and complex views on the ANC's alliance with the Communist Party, sheds light on some of the challenges faced by the ANC in attracting American support amid the Cold War.", "source": {"uri": "bunkhistory.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bunk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_resistance_to_apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internal resistance to apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Revolutionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party USA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhodesia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.bunkhistory.org/derivatives/og/images/2024-05-02/$2y$10$zu3Qy.w8NmeYVc1RuWpdcOtFI424QTXvWK2QsoccL2Wzw10R1NDvu/ancapartheid.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546540", "eventUri": "eng-9546540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

With a rich history of liberation Struggle and a proven track record of governance, it is worthwhile encouraging all eligible, registered voters to cast their votes for the ANC.\n\nIt is critical enlightening citizens about quite a few things that makes the ANC the best party to vote for. Foremost among these is that it has been at the forefront of the Struggle against apartheid, leading the fight for freedom and equality for all South Africans.\n\nNelson Mandela, an iconic figure in world history, was a member of the ANC and its first, democratically elected president. The party's legacy of resistance and resilience in the face of oppression is deeply ingrained in the nation's consciousness.\n\nThe ANC has remained steadfast in its pursuit for a more just and equitable society. The sacrifices made by countless individuals in the Struggle for liberation, coupled with the ANC's unwavering dedication to the principles of democracy and social justice, have left an indelible mark on the fabric of SA society.\n\nThis legacy serves not only as a reminder of the injustices of the past but also as a source of inspiration for future generations. Since the dawn of democracy in 1994, the ANC has remained steadfast in its commitment to upholding the principles of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nBy championing the principles of accountability, transparency and responsiveness, the ANC has endeavoured to foster a political landscape where governance is conducted with integrity and in the best interests of the nation.\n\nMost importantly, the ANC recognises the urgent need for economic transformation to address the inequalities inherited from the apartheid era. Through its policies and programmes, the party aims to create an inclusive economy that provides opportunities for all South Africans to thrive.\n\nFrom job-creation initiatives to investment in education and skills development, the ANC is committed to building a prosperous future for the nation. The ANC continues to champion the rights of marginalised communities, including women, youth and people living with disabilities.\n\nAlso of great importance, as SA navigates the challenges of the 21st century, the ANC offers a clear vision for the future of the nation. Its policies are grounded in the values of unity, reconciliation and progress, aiming to build a society at peace with itself and the world.\n\nThe ANC has committed mistakes and let itself down by those it gives tasks of either leading it or those who are expected to implement its policies which are biased toward the poor.\n\nThe ANC has in so many times admitted to the challenges, and admitting is a good start in that it can now work with speed to resolve some of the most critical challenges like provision of good quality water and dealing with issues of healthcare.\n\nIn deciding why the ANC must be given another chance, South Africans must take into account the devastating Covid-19 pandemic, which meant in the term there were two years of doing absolutely nothing rather than managing the impact of the pandemic, the natural disasters.", "source": {"uri": "sowetanlive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sowetan LIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandile_Ndlovu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sandile Ndlovu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fikile_Mbalula", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fikile Mbalula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nelson Mandela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hGjmKPNERT2-w2sLdFKcJtXlo_LLdJMesTX6neGQmCl9vbkZ2T1BpWF3qAxPjJyZsAVseFYDXrsCGlf6Xd_Vi5YaCaHE56Xqc1RDIxRgJrRASBQ=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546540", "eventUri": "eng-9546540", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 189, "textEnd": 195}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He is affiliated with the South African Association of Public Administration and Management(SAAPAM).\n\nFormer South African president Jacob Zuma surprised many in December 2023 by declaring he'd canvass for a new rival to the African National Congress (ANC), the party he used to lead. The new uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) is on the ballot papers in the upcoming national election and provincial elections.\n\nOpinion polls suggest that the upstart will worsen the electoral woes of the ruling ANC in Zuma's heartland, KwaZulu-Natal province. The ANC, which has governed the country since 1994, goes into the elections uncertain about securing the more than 50% majority needed to form a government. We asked political scientist Mashupye H. Maserumule for his insights on the MK Party.\n\nWhat does it stand for?\n\nThe party will be barely 10 months old when the elections take place on 29 May.\n\nHowever, it describes itself as being \"rooted in a rich history of striving for justice and equality\". Its declared vision is to\n\ntransform South Africa into a beacon of equality, prosperity and sustainability.\n\nThere are a number of problems with this. Firstly, it's what almost all parties promise. And the MK Party doesn't have a coherent policy on how to realise this vision, let alone a clear ideological position to distinguish itself from other political parties.\n\nSecondly, the party has adopted incendiary rhetoric, tinged with populist extremism. For example, it talks about doing away with the supremacy of the country's constitution and replacing it with \"unfettered\" parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nThis is troubling because South Africa has been on a path of establishing a constitutional democracy based on a set of essential rights for its citizens since its first democratic elections in 1994. It's also undesirable because parliament ruled supreme under apartheid, passing unjust laws that oppressed the majority black population.\n\nRead more: South Africa's constitution was set up as the bedrock of its democracy: it's been challenged over last 30 years, but has held firm\n\nThe party also promises to incorporate traditional leadership in the country's parliamentary system. This is not necessarily to be frowned upon, but it has the potential to upend the country's constitutional democracy. For, in this system of managing public affairs, the rule of law lies with the constitution.\n\nUniversity of Johannesburg political scientist Siphamandla Zondi sees the MK Party as\n\njust another faction of the ANC that has decided to operate from outside the ANC.\n\nPolitical commentator Eugene Brink says it's \"Zuma's get-out-of-jail card\".\n\nI agree.\n\nZuma's almost two-decades-old corruption charges related to the 1999 arms deal - to acquire and upgrade the post-apartheid military's equipment - are still hovering over his head and he continues to be in and out of court. He is hoping to win a two-thirds majority to change the constitution, and give himself the power to override the court process. He pits the rule of law and the supremacy of the constitution against traditional leadership.\n\nWhat lies behind the MK Party's formation?\n\nThe MK Party was launched on 16 December 2023 in Soweto. It was at this event that Zuma announced his association with it. He has since emerged as its leader and has been campaigning vigorously for it as its public face.\n\nRead more: The two faces of Jacob Zuma - former South African president campaigns to unseat the ANC he once led. Who supports him and why?\n\nThe MK Party's formation is linked to Zuma's longstanding grievance against the ANC. That came to a head following his arrest and incarceration on 7 July 2021 for refusing to appear before the State Capture Commission. He had defied the order of the Constitutional Court to do so and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment.\n\nWhy are the party's name and logo controversial?\n\nThe name uMkhonto weSizwe, MK in short, historically belongs to the ANC's military wing. It means \"the spear of the nation\".\n\nIn the early 1960s, ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo, the head of South Africa's Communist Party, were tasked by the ANC to form the MK.\n\nMore than six decades later Zuma's MK Party argues that the ANC cannot claim exclusivity to the MK name as its creation. For its part, the ANC has claimed that MK is inextricably linked to the ANC.\n\nRead more: How Pentecostalism explains Jacob Zuma's defiance and lack of shame\n\nThe ANC tried to stop the MK party from using the name uMkhonto weSizwe and trademark or anything similar to it. It argued that the use of the logo constituted a breach of the country's Trade Marks Act. But the High Court dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was mulling appealing the case at the time of writing.\n\nWhat are the MK Party's prospects?\n\nOpinion polls predict that the MK Party is likely to get 8.4% of the national vote.\n\nThat would make it the fourth biggest party in South Africa - after the ANC, Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters. It is also expected to get more than 30% of the provincial vote in KwaZulu-Natal, making it a major party in Zuma's home province.\n\nRead more: Jacob Zuma likes to be cast as a man of the people - but is he?\n\nIts biggest existential threat is Zuma (82) himself. The party is personalised around him. It may not have any political future without him given that it is relying heavily on the euphoria Zuma engenders by using Zulu ethno-nationalism and populist rhetoric.\n\nThe young party is already racked by factionalism, power struggles and leadership purges.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Over a third of the population receives cash grants and other social support.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the government created a new benefit for the working-age unemployed accessed by over 6 million people. Though meant to be temporary, it was extended earlier this year, against the advice of Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana.\n\nFor Thabo Mbeki - an ANC leader and South Africa's president from 1999 to 2008 - the welfare system was never intended to be a cure for poverty and unemployment. Instead, the goal was to grow an inclusive economy so more people could earn an income.\n\n\"That hasn't worked as well as it should. And I think that objective, we need to get back to it,\" he told Reuters.\n\nDalene Raiters lost her job at a local primary school 16 years ago. Her adult son is also jobless. Like many South Africans, their entire family of four lives off the grants of those who qualify.\n\nFor Raiters that means the 1,080 rand ($58) per month she receives for two minor dependents - her teenage boy and grandson supplemented with handouts from a local mosque, feeding schemes or odd jobs she does for neighbours.\n\nWhile the ANC denies it will need a coalition, most polls predict an end to its single-party governance after May 29.\n\nThe business-friendly, centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) - the largest opposition party - would seem an awkward fit.\n\nWhile it is promising to increase the value of select grants and convert the pandemic-era payment into a job-seekers grant, it is primarily focused on job creation.\n\nIt wants to relax labour laws and do away with affirmative action aimed at redressing apartheid-era discrimination.\n\nThough the DA squarely blames the ANC for the country's current troubles, it has not ruled out partnering with its ideological opponent to prevent what leader John Steenhuisen dubs a \"doomsday coalition\" of the ANC and the Marxist EFF.\n\n\"I've seen the mass emigration from places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. I've seen the starvation,\" Steenhuisen told Reuters. \"I don't want that for South Africa.\"\n\nThe EFF, which has stated its desire for the finance portfolio were it to partner with the ANC, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.\n\nIts demands for land redistribution and the nationalisation of mines and banks have long spooked investors.\n\nAnd its election manifesto calls for a doubling of existing social benefits across the board, the establishment of a new grant for unemployed university graduates and more free public services for the poor.\n\nMichael Sachs, an economist at the Southern Centre for Inequality Studies, said the system currently has the resources to support its intended beneficiaries: children and pensioners.\n\nWhat it can't do is cope with the effects of skyrocketing unemployment and formal sector stagnation.\n\n\"If those social problems continue to mount and the only answer of government is to provide more social grants, then eventually it will become unsustainable, definitely,\" he said.\n\nFor Raiters, the answer isn't more welfare benefits: only work will give the next generation a chance.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to live a long time,\" she said. \"But for the future, I hope my grandson can get a better job.\"\n\n(Reporting by Kopano Gumbi and Joe Bavier; Additional reporting by Sisipho Skweyiya, Sfundo Parakozov, Tim Cocks and

Over a third of the population receives cash grants and other social support.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the government created a new benefit for the working-age unemployed accessed by over 6 million people.

The Multi-Party Charter (MPC) has 11 member parties who have agreed on broad policy priorities including a commitment to a free market economy, and whose ambition is to dislodge the ANC in the most unpredictable election of the post-apartheid era.\n\nAn alliance of South African opposition parties can win a May 29 election and would bring significant change after 30 years of African National Congress (ANC) government, the chairperson of the talks that led to the alliance being formed said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Multi-Party Charter (MPC) has 11 member parties who have agreed on broad policy priorities including a commitment to a free market economy, and whose ambition is to dislodge the ANC in the most unpredictable election of the post-apartheid era. Polls suggest the ANC will lose its majority while remaining the largest party, opening the possibility of a coalition government.\n\n\"This is our first election that will go to the wire,\" William Gumede, who chaired the 2023 convention that resulted in the MPC, said in an interview with Reuters. Gumede, a professor of public management at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg who is not affiliated with any party, said the ANC had failed, citing economic stagnation, poor delivery of basic services, corruption and other problems.\n\nThe MPC policies include adherence to the constitution and the rule of law for all, free market economics, using private sector firms to deliver services, and a commitment to social justice paired with welfare reform that would tie certain benefits to participation in skills training, Gumede said. The most prominent parties in the group include the Democratic Alliance (DA), which won the second largest share of the vote in the last election five years ago, and ActionSA, led by a respected former mayor of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba.\n\nOthers include the socially conservative Inkatha Freedom Party, which draws its support mostly from Zulus, and Freedom Front Plus, which represents the interests of the white Afrikaner community. PATH TO VICTORY?\n\nThe alliance's diversity was one of its main points, Gumede said, as South Africa needs to tap into all its talents, both in terms of its racial and cultural diversity and the dynamism of its business community, to improve its fortunes. The ANC has not publicly acknowledged it could lose its majority or said who it would pick as a coalition partner.\n\nFor Gumede and member parties of the MPC, the worst-case scenario would be a coalition between the ANC and one or both of two smaller left-wing parties, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK). A March poll by the Brenthurst Foundation, a Johannesburg-based think tank, found support for the ANC at 39%, while the opposition alliance parties were collectively on 33%. MK had 13% support, while the EFF was on 10%.\n\nPolled on which coalition option they would prefer, 29% of respondents favoured the MPC, 25% an ANC/DA alliance and 24% an ANC/EFF deal. Gumede said the MPC had everything to play for given the unpredictability of the situation and the fraught relations between the EFF, MK and some ANC factions.\n\nMuch will depend on turnout, he said, pointing out that in the last election 9 million registered voters did not vote. The MPC could win if 2 million of them turned up for member parties, he said, adding that dissatisfaction with the ANC was so high that the governing party was unlikely to boost its own numbers.\n\n\"They didn't turn up for the ANC in 2019 and they're not going to now,\" he said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Its future could depend on who in a field that includes two dominant parties espousing vastly divergent political visions - the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or Democratic Alliance - the ANC chooses as a coalition partner if it loses its majority, as polls suggest. \"It's an enormous mark of failure, and it is not sustainable ...

This has led some analysts to suggest Zuma may be in a position to be kingmaker - with the MK possibly becoming the majority party in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN).\n\nPolitical commentator Justice Malala, writing in a column last month, said \"Zuma has been winning the public relations war against the ANC at every turn\", and argued that the MK's dominance in KZN may put the former leader in a kingmaker position in national coalition talks.\n\nIf the ANC does as poorly ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KwaZulu-Natal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546540", "eventUri": "eng-9546540", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "KwaZulu-Natal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 471, "textEnd": 477}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

The ANC has pulled out its bigwigs on the party's campaign trail ahead of the May 29 polls.\n\nAlexandra township is a community plagued with several issues including a lack of service delivery, lack of housing, sewage spillages and potholes amongst other things.\n\nThis time around, Mabuza took to the streets of Alex to canvass for his party. Speaking to the media on the sidelines of his campaign, Mabuza said their unrelenting task of renewal would go a long way in restoring the people's hope in the ANC if it dealt with the challenges facing the country.\n\n\"The renewal of the ANC is the core task that the ANC must undertake, and the ANC is currently on that task. Remember it is not going to be an even and is not going to be a one-day thing, it's going to be a process. We are going to uproot all rogue elements in the ANC. For the ANC to deal with the current challenges, it must reshape itself, it must not degenerate that is the promise that we are making. We are going to renew ourselves, it's a question of do-or-die for the ANC to renew itself. So, it is our challenges and we are not going to fail to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nMabuza says the governing party is aware of the challenges that the people of Alexandra face and is dealing with them.\n\nThe residents of Alexandra still have not benefitted from the R1.6 billion Alexandra Renewal Project which was meant to redevelop the township.\n\n\"We've built a lot of houses, I'm aware that there are a lot of people that are without houses that's why I'm saying we have done so much, there is still a lot that needs to be done, we are on a journey, we can't betray our people. I'm aware of the challenges that are within the ANC, those are challenges that we are going to resolve as the ANC. We are not going to allow failures to define us, we are going to learn from our failures and do better,\" says Mabuza.\n\nMeanwhile, Gogo Rhoda a resident of Alexandra who followed Mabuza on his campaign trail, says her vote is going to the governing party.\n\n\"People have record houses.

Ramaphosa condemned what he described as an abuse of the national flag for party political purposes.\n\nECONOMIC FREEDOM FIGHTERS\n\nFormed in 2013 by Julius Malema, a firebrand former leader of the ANC's youth wing who broke away from the party, the EFF draws its support predominantly from voters who are young, poor and Black.\n\nThe party presents itself as Marxist, advocating the nationalisation of industries and land redistribution to address racial injustice -- policies that are unpopular with South Africa's business community.\n\nThe EFF is seen as a potential coalition partner for the ANC due to Malema's historic ties with the ruling party.\n\nUMKHONTO WE SIZWE (MK)\n\nThe MK party is a recent entrant, having been registered in September 2023, but it received a major boost when former president Jacob Zuma, who has fallen out with the ANC, announced in December he was backing it.\n\nPolls suggest it has been eating into the EFF's support base and could attract significant votes on May 29, especially in Zuma's home province of KwaZulu Natal where he retains a loyal following.\n\nThe EFF's Malema, who has a complicated history with Zuma, has said his party is open to a post-election alliance with MK. Malema was once Zuma's protege, but the pair fell out, after which Malema left the ANC.\n\nMK is named after the ANC's former armed wing in the apartheid era.\n\nINKATHA FREEDOM PARTY\n\nThe socially conservative IFP, led by Velenkosini Hlabisa, draws its support from KwaZulu Natal province, the Zulu heartland. Its policies include giving more power to traditional rulers and launching a national debate on reinstating the death penalty.\n\nFounded in 1975 by Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the IFP has a fraught history with the ANC. The parties were in violent conflict during the final years of apartheid, but worked together in the government of national unity that was formed after the 1994 election.\n\nACTIONSA\n\nFounded in 2020, ActionSA is popular in the country's richest province of Gauteng, where the commercial capital Johannesburg is located. Its leader Herman Mashaba was the city's mayor, though he was part of the DA at the time.\n\nThe party says it favours minimal government interference in the economy.\n\n(Reporting by Bhargav Acharya

It has also shown that new coalitions could emerge in provinces hitherto governed by the ANC.\n\nSuch an outcome would represent a significant change for the country, as well as a dramatic decline for the ANC itself, whose electoral support peaked at nearly 67% in 2004 and came in at a comfortable 57% in 2019.\n\nA key question, therefore, is how far below the 50% threshold the ANC will fall. Some polls have indicated that its share of the vote could fall to below 40%, even though few anticipate such a calamitous slump. Nevertheless, the coalition permutations should the ANC fall below 45% are potentially unsettling for the currency, investors, business, and the reforms under way in the electricity, freight logistics, water, and tourism sectors.\n\nThe permutation anticipated to be most disruptive to the reform momentum is one where the ANC turns to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Such a coalition is already in place in the Gauteng metropolitan council of Ekurhuleni. And the ANC's populist Gauteng Premier, Panyaza Lesufi, has openly defied national instructions not to align with the EFF, given his recognition that prospects for securing a majority absent a coalition with the EFF are slim.\n\nShould such a coalition remain restricted to the provinces, even one as economically significant as Gauteng, business sentiment and the reforms agenda will be dented but not seriously damaged. Should it extend to the national level, however, the reaction is likely to be far more intense and long-lasting.\n\nThe question then will be whether the reform agenda being implemented by President Cyril Ramaphosa's government will be sustained and whether Ramaphosa himself will remain.\n\nA coalition with the EFF would certainly slow the reforms, and make Ramaphosa's position extremely precarious. In some cases, the reforms will be abandoned. Once the challenges of governance become clearer, though, it is unlikely that they will all be halted, particularly when doing so could result in a swing back to politically harmful crises such as daily loadshedding.\n\nAnother possible scenario if the ANC falls below 45% is to force a grand centralist coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA).\n\nIn the short term, this would be a business-friendly outcome and growth- and reform-supportive. However, it would be a hard sell internally for both parties and would de-fang the DA as an opposition force, potentially leaving more unstable parties to occupy that crucial position.\n\nThe least destabilising, albeit uninspiring, outcome is arguably one where the ANC secures 45%-plus and cobbles together a majority with small parties.\n\nGiven these stakes, falling levels of engagement by the electorate are worrying.", "source": {"uri": "engineeringnews.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terence_creamer@engineeringnews.co.za", "name": "Terence Creamer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panyaza_Lesufi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panyaza Lesufi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ekurhuleni_Metropolitan_Municipality", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Gauteng", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Gauteng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling blackout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centralized government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001129829_resized_terencecreamereditorinsight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546540", "eventUri": "eng-9546540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

However, recent by-elections in which the MK Party contested, made it clear its existence was impacting all organisations, and not just the governing ANC.\n\nThe advent of the MK Party came with mixed messages, with some claiming to belong to the organisation threatening mayhem if Zuma did not find his way back in the Union Buildings.

Africa's opposition parties may struggle to unseat the ruling ANC\n          49m ago", "body": "African National Congress supporters, one holding a portrait of Nelson Mandela, gather at a stadium in Durban, South Africa as the party launched its 2024 election manifesto\n\nFOR the first time in 30 years, South Africa's governing party faces an electoral crisis with expectations that its support will dramatically reduce and it may lose its parliamentary majority in this month's election.\n\nBut even as the African National Congress (ANC) - which has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 - struggles to attract voters, it has one key advantage that could help it stay in power, analysts say.\n\nA splintered, disorganised opposition\n\nWith 70 political parties and 11 independent candidates contesting the May 29 national and provincial elections, the opposition is fragmented, according to Mcebisi Ndletyana, professor of political science at the University of Johannesburg.\n\nHe said both the ANC and the official opposition are at the risk of declining support.\n\nThe ANC received 57 percent of the vote in the last general elections held in 2019 but its support is expected to plummet given rising unemployment, a persisting power crisis and allegations of growing misgovernance.\n\nAccording to a recent opinion poll by market research firm Ipsos, the ANC's support now sits at 40.2 percent.\n\nA series of opinion polls have also predicted that the ruling party may lose the majority needed to form a national government.\n\nHowever, despite an expected decline in the ANC's performance, analysts have also pointed at possible stagnation in support for its main rivals.\n\nThe same poll done by Ipsos shows marginal growth for three of the country's top opposition parties - the Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).\n\nThe ANC has fashioned itself as a centre-left party while the DA is right-leaning. The EFF is a left-wing party that promotes for wholesale nationalisation of land. On the other hand, the IFP has risen on the back of Zulu nationalism and leans to the right.\n\nThe Ipsos poll estimated that the DA, which is the ANC's nearest rival, was at 21.9 percent - a slight increase in support since the 2019 vote.\n\nThe EFF and IFP showed similar stagnation, polling at 11.5 percent and 4.4 percent respectively - just above one percentage point better than how they each faired in the last election.\n\n\"There is fragmentation of the opposition because even with the ANC losing support, the DA and the EFF are not showing significant growth,\" Ndletyana explained, attributing it to a litany of new political entrants attracting pockets of support in the constituencies of established political parties.\n\n\"They are supposed to be consolidating but there is further fragmentation among the opposition,\" he said.\n\nAt least 31 new political parties have registered to contest the upcoming elections, the country's Electoral Commission (IEC) said.\n\nEmeritus professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, Susan Booysen, said \"the greatest irony\" of the South African elections was that the decline in the ANC's support was not leading to a massive increase in support for the top opposition parties.\n\n\"This is one of the riddles of South African politics,\" she said. \"There is a lot of splintering happening. This explains a bit of it. At the same time, much of the discontent with the ANC still goes back to voting for the ANC because there are no sufficient alternative parties.\n\n\"Also, the ANC has delegitimised the opposition as a viable alternative.\"\n\nThe ANC, as the main liberation movement that fought and helped end apartheid, has sought to downplay the role and relevance of the opposition in South Africa.\n\nBooysen said voters cannot imagine the opposition becoming a viable government nationally, before turning to Italian Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci's famous comment - made in the context of neoliberalism.\n\n\"The old is dying but the new is not ready to be born. It is a clich\u00e9 but it speaks of the current reality in our political landscape,\" she said.\n\nOpposition coalition\n\nNdletyana said there was all indication that no single party would receive a majority and that a government would be formed through a coalition.\n\n\"The ANC will remain the largest party after the elections because its main rivals are not showing significant growth,\" he added.\n\nNdletyana said he did not believe efforts to arrange a pre-election coalition led by the DA, called the Multi-Party Charter (MPC) had real prospects of success.\n\n\"I don't think they have a real chance of becoming the government,\" he said.\n\nThe MPC is an 11-member party formation seeking to remove the ANC from power nationally and to block an ANC coalition deal with the leftist EFF.\n\nBesides the DA, the MPC includes the IFP, the centre-right ActionSA, a breakaway of the DA, and the conservative Freedom Front plus - as well as a number of micro-parties.\n\nThese parties accounted for about 25 percent of the vote in the 2019 election. Several opinion polls suggest that support for the MPC, at its best case, hovers at between 35 percent and 37 percent this election - not enough to form a majority to unseat the ANC.\n\nHowever, William Gumede, an associate professor at the Wits School of Governance at the University of the Witwatersrand and chair of the MPC, disagreed, saying it has never been more possible for the opposition to form a majority and unseat the ANC.\n\n\"When we started the conversation about the Multi-Party Charter, we said the ANC's majority would slip to below 50 percent. Now we are looking at the ANC slipping to 40 percent. The MPC has a real chance to fight,\" he said.\n\nThe block of opposition parties aimed at unseating the ANC have agreed-upon principles which include upholding the South African Constitution, the rule of law and equality before the law.\n\nIt also includes decentralising the power of government, creating a transparent government and zero tolerance towards corruption.\n\nThe MPC committed to efficient spending of public money by the government, an open market economy, as well as the promotion of nonracialism.\n\n\"The Multi-Party Charter has communicated its policies and showed South Africans how it could be an alternative government,\" said Gumede, who has negotiated between party leaders to form the pre-election pact.\n\nOn a provincial level, the MPC has its eyes set on winning KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng, two of the largest provinces where they expect the ANC's support to plummet. In those provinces, analysts say the opposition are more likely to form a minority coalition.\n\nBooysen said while there was hope for the MPC, it did not hold the prospects of becoming an alternative to the ANC government as projected.\n\n\"It's an initiative whose time has not come yet. Its success is based on the possibility that it can beat the ANC but they have not gathered enough parties or support to be a formidable opposition,\" she said.\n\n\"In concept, it is very good but in practice, it has not pulled together the necessary support.\"\n\nDespite predictions of the ANC's decline, it has remained bullish about its prospects given the disorganisation of opposition parties.\n\n\"Polls are polls. We know, as the ANC, how well we are going to do, and our people, in their hearts, know how well the ANC is going to do,\" President Cyril Ramaphosa said on the sidelines of the election campaign on Sunday.\n\nNew threat\n\nAmong the new entrants to the political sphere is the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) party led by former South African president Jacob Zuma. The Ipsos poll predicted this party may garner up to 8.4 percent in support.\n\nThe ANC is losing support to Zuma's new political party mainly in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nZuma has said he would not vote for the ANC for the first time in 30 years because the party has \"lost its way\".\n\nThe MK, which is proposing more radical socialist policies, has relied on the star power of the former head of state to attract supporters ahead of the elections.\n\n\"The emergence of the MK Party has affected both the ANC and the EFF,\" Booysen noted, further adding that the full extent of the MK's influence would be seen at the elections.\n\nEFF leader Julius Malema, whose party is also losing support to the MK, tried to downplay recent opinion polls.\n\n\"Stand tall, leaders of the EFF, you can't be intimidated by Ipsos. Ipsos didn't say anything wrong, it just tells you where you need to work hard. Use that to motivate yourself,\" he said to supporters on Sunday.\n\nBoth Booysen and Gumede agreed that while the polls are not a final indicator of election results, they give a strong indication of how parties will perform.\n\n\"There are still many undecided voters who will decide to vote for in the days before the election,\" Gumede said.", "source": {"uri": "ippmedia.com", "dataType": "news",

All these parties that are starting are people who are unhappy with things that have happened inside the ANC. While we renew the ANC, we don't forget that the people who did wrong inside the ANC have found their way into society, so they cause problems inside society.\"\n\nThis bears unpacking. Or at least an attempt at unpacking. Is it an admission that the ANC is to be blamed for everything that the ANC has cocked up? And by everything, we could mean that quite literally. There is perhaps no facet of our public life that has emerged from the rot unscathed.\n\nStill, the empty promises come. But, added to the avowals of a better life for all, just around the corner, is the equally hollow suggestion of a newfound humility. As Sexwale described it, the leadership \"is bending our knees\" before the people. -->\n\n\"We promise them a better life because we promised them in 1994. We are also promising a better life because we want to renew the ANC and reconstruct the country by putting people in power who understand the requirements of the ANC.\"\n\nOh dear. That bit didn't come out too well, did it? Given that we're well aware of what the ruling party regards as its \"requirements\". But we get it, we really do. It's all so very poignant, and we'd be in tears if we weren't laughing so much.\n\nAccidents will happen\n\nAn intriguing report at the weekend from Sky News on developments arising from insults directed at the criminal defendant Donald Trump by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. In recent posts on X (formerly Twitter), Cohen called his former client \"Von ShitzInPantz\". This, as some regulars at the Slaughtered Lamb (\"Finest Ales & Pies\") flippantly offer, is not a reference to the man's Teutonic heritage. -->\n\nBut, and as a result of Cohen's taunts, the presidential contender's supporters are wearing nappies at his rallies. These are sported over trousers and leggings, much like Superman and other comic book superheroes wear their underpants, and often with T-shirts with slogans like \"Diapers over Dems\" and \"Real Men Wear Diapers\" to complete the ensemble. Further evidence, perhaps, of the infantilism that, along with the petulance and narcissism, has characterised the Trump campaign.\n\nI wonder, though, whether our own politicians may draw inspiration here, particularly in the final weeks before the elections. Commentators, after all, routinely refer to ours as a fledgling democracy, one that is not quite adult or grown up. This is not an inaccurate description. Judging by the behaviour of some elected representatives -- the violence of EFF eThekwini city councillors in November last year, for example -- it is clear that many are not housetrained and do frequently soil themselves.\n\nBranding opportunities are obvious. Who among us would not welcome the sight of ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula sucking away at the rubber teat of a yellow and green milk bottle? It would at least keep him quiet for a while. Rallies could also see ruling party supporters waving baby rattles as Cyril Ramaphosa makes cooing noises at the podium. (\"Open wide, here comes the choo-choo...\")\n\nAt MK Party events, Jacob Zuma could be presented to the faithful in a cot. From which, obviously, various toys will be hurled. Playpens, on the other hand, are to be avoided, given the symbolism of the bars. EFF leader Julius Malema, meanwhile, may prefer a pram, one perhaps in a sporty fire-engine red, along with a nanny to give his nose an occasional wipe.\n\nAn added bonus to all this is the nostalgic warmth derived from revisiting the innocence and security of the toddler years. If we are to progress into the future by going backwards, as the ANC suggests, then this is the probably the direction to take. Shun maturity at all costs and head for the warmth of the womb.\n\nGrowing pains\n\nElsewhere, the confected outrage at the Democratic Alliance's latest campaign advertisement is further evidence of the childish seam now foregrounded in national affairs. The advert features the burning of a paper South African flag while a voice-over warns of a disastrous future under an ANC-EFF-MK coalition government. Then, and as if by magic and phoenix-like from the ashes, the flag is returned to its original form along with the advert's crucial message: the DA will save the country.\n\nWhether or not we agree with this is moot. The point is simply this: no actual flag is burnt here. This is an allegory. What unfolds is intended to reveal a broader, more significant message. Namely, that an ANC-EFF-MK coalition government would be very bad news for us all.\n\nTo my mind, this message is abundantly clear and, frankly, if anyone fails to understand this, well, they're either being wilfully obtuse or are just naturally stupid. Personally, I'd go for the former; I'm a kind-hearted softie and, seriously, no-one can possibly be that dumb.\n\nStill, there was the predictable and spittle-flecked rush to righteous indignation. As Ferial Haffajee, writing in the Daily Maverick, observes: \"A firestorm hit the [DA] after it touched people on their studio. We love our flag, and seeing it burn has got many people seething, including the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela and others.\"\n\nThere are two things to consider here. The first is the unfortunate \"touching on the studio\" reference. This, as some readers may recall, stems from a disastrous April 2010 episode of the e.tv current affairs programme, Africa 360, which featured former AWB secretary general and all-round windbag Andr\u00e9 Visagie in discussion with political analyst Lebohang Pheko.\n\nFollowing a heated exchange on race relations, Visagie lost his temper, ripped off his microphone and stormed out the studio while the show's host, Chris Maroleng, shouted after him, \"[Don't] touch me on my studio, [don't] touch me on my studio!\" Visagie responded, \"I'll touch you on your studio!\"\n\nThe incident became the focus of many jokes on social media, but the poet Antjie Krog did have misgivings about the meme. It was, she said, a case of \"an Afrikaner and a black man's inability to use correct English [becoming] the laughing stock of the country\".\n\nKrog had a point: is it fair to mock those whose language is rubbish? In the hope they learn from the unpleasant experience and get it right next time? Or do we look on politely as they waffle on, clashing metaphors in a torrent of Manglish? And sneer at them silently on the inside? This is terribly arrogant of me, I will admit, but if we don't have standards, well, we'd all be talking gibberish like Tokyo Sexwale. We'd never understand one another.\n\nThe second thing is this: do we unequivocally love the flag? I mean, there are flags and then there are flags. There is, for instance, a massive difference between the budgie smuggler valiantly displayed by Springbok scrumhalf Faf de Klerk after the 2019 Rugby World Cup final and the vulgar nationalistic mega-rag that former sports, arts and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa wanted to fly from a R22-million flagpole in Pretoria's Freedom Park.\n\nContext, after all, is everything in these matters.",

Most parties are gearing up for the final push to convince voters to make a cross next to their names on May 29. However, the reality is that only a few will make it to national parliament and provincial legislatures. There are currently 14 political parties represented in parliament and this number is not expected to differ significantly after the 2024 elections, as voters ultimately sift the real players from the pretenders.\n\nThe huge number of parties contesting elections in South Africa in particular, has often been hailed as the beauty of multi-party democracy. Professor Kwesi Prah, in a 1994 paper titled \"Multi-Party Democracy and It's Relevance in Africa,\" hailed multi-party political systems as the most reliable systems for the cultivation, development and institutionalization of democracy as \"It allows a hundred flowers to bloom and a hundred schools of thought to contend\".\n\nHowever, it can be argued that the increasing number of political parties emerging in South Africa is not doing much in contributing to the diversity of views and schools of thought, as stated by Prah. For one, many of the emerging parties in South Africa are iterations of existing parties and, in some instances, share ideological orientations. A look at the manifestos of most parties contesting the 29 May elections, show that most pose similar solutions to the country's challenges. The question that some may ask is, if most parties share similar ideologies and solutions, why don't we have fewer parties? Perhaps the answer lies in politicians' quest for power and control.\n\nMost parties that exist today are splinters or breakaways from other parties. To name a few, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK Party) are from the African National Congress (ANC); and ActionSA and Build One South Africa (BOSA) are from the Democratic Alliance (DA). It can be said that leaders that go on to form their own parties are driven by disagreements or egos. As a result, they do not present viable alternatives in terms of policies. They exist to hurt the parties they left by way of a reduction in votes or securing their relevance, as they have no other prospects outside of politics.\n\nThere is also the element of the 'no one else but me' complex that exists in South African politics and which has seen leaders opting to form their own parties instead of joining other formations that share their values and political outlook. For most, the prospect of serving under another leader is seemingly too much to comprehend.\n\nSince 1994, some of the parties that broke away from the ANC include the United Democratic Movement (UDM), Congress of the People (COPE), the EFF, the African Congress for Transformation (ACT) and most recently, the MK Party. Though, the ANC has managed to thwart the threats posed by some of these parties in each election, they have managed to eat away at its voter base and may see the ruling party obtain less than 50% in the national elections for the first time since 1994. The policies of the breakaway parties are essentially those of the ANC, and they have not been that convincing in how they will implement those policies better than the ANC. This may explain why those parties have not managed to lure voters en masse away from the ANC. And since they are mostly centred on the popularity of their leaders, the parties, to some exception the EFF, have also not managed to amass new voters.\n\nVoters are alive to the circumstances surrounding the formation of the new parties, which has led to them mistrusting their stated intentions and not giving them their votes. The majority of the leaders that went on to form breakaway parties did not leave voluntarily over policy disagreements, but due to internal party power plays which left them out in the cold.\n\nUp until the 2019 elections, the DA was growing and posing a somewhat serious threat to the ANC. However, the wheels started to fall off with the dismissal of Mmusi Maimane as leader in 2020. Maimane's departure from the DA was followed by a series of resignations of mainly black leaders from the party, who went on to join or form their own formations. Herman Mashaba formed ActionSA, Maimane formed BOSA and Makashule Gana co-founded Rise Mzansi.\n\nFor its part, the DA seems to not be taking the emergence of parties with which it shares common liberal orientations very well. Similar to the ANC, the breakaways and the Freedom Front Plus are eating away at the DA's voter base and may trigger its eventual decline from being a major player in national politics. The DA, in turn, does not seem to have an answer to its splinter parties and has resorted to direct attacks which do not seem to be doing it any favours. A dismal performance in the upcoming May 29 elections may see another leadership change and a reconsideration of policy positions for the main opposition.\n\nThe DA, in an attempt to consolidate the opposition vote, led the creation of a 'Multi-Party Charter' around parties with similar values. However, it has since collapsed not only because of a lack of prospects to unseat the ANC, but also because of egos. The ANC is projected to fall below 50% if polls are to be believed and the possibility of the party entering into a coalition agreement at national level seem high. Analysts have been speculating on which parties would be ideal partners for the ANC. Naturally, the choice should not be difficult if we are using ideological orientations as a base. However, the reality is that egos and power plays will be at the centre of post-elections negotiations. Selfish interests more than the needs of the voters will be the order of the day, even though parties will have people believe otherwise. It is not unimaginable that the way things are playing out at local government level may spill into the provincial and/or national levels. The EFF and MKP will put difficult terms on the table to support the ANC. An ANC-DA partnership may not go down well with their voters. An ANC-IFP and smaller parties coalition may be palatable to most citizens and investors but may see the ANC compromising a lot for the sake of governing, as seen at local government.\n\nUltimately, politics is about the pursuit and consolidation of power. The days of contending schools of thought are long gone and have been replaced with thuggery and corruption. In the end, voters are just bargaining tools and chips in the game that politicians play with each other.", "source": {"uri": "politicalanalysis.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "PoliticalAnalysis

This negatively affected the popularity of the ANC. Together with the fear among other ANC members that Zuma was also giving Zulus disproportionate power within the ANC, and with backing from white business, the \"moderate\" wing mounted a comeback, forcing Zuma's resignation and the election as party president of Cyril Ramaphosa in December 2017.\n\nZuma has been defending himself ever since against legal accusations of corruption. His brief incarceration in 2021 for contempt of the Constitutional Court led to an outburst of violent protest and looting, principally in his home province of KZN. He was rapidly made part of a general sentence remission and released.\n\nThe July 2021 unrest underscored three crucial points, each very relevant to this analysis:\n\nThat said, by the end of 2023 it had become increasingly clear that Zuma's \"Stalingrad\" stalling tactics in court had effectively reached the end of the road. This time, Team Zuma analysed the national constitution. Based on proportional representation and thus systemically favouring the creation of a multitude of small parties, the opportunity was there for Zuma to once again become a member of parliament. -->\n\nFORCING A COALITION GOVERNMENT BY WEAKENING THE ANC\n\nMore importantly, though - if the ANC could be brought to below 50% of the seats in parliament by siphoning off a chunk of their traditional voters with Zuma's new MK party, then the ANC would be forced to seek coalition partners and the tail may end up wagging the dog. (The fact that the MK name and logo were chosen, makes it clear that the principal objective is to siphon off ANC voters to this \"purified\" or \"original\" party harking back to the liberation movement days; the part's manifesto with its Africanist and NDR objectives also makes this clear).\n\nThe importance of all of the foregoing when one assesses the probability of violence prior, during and especially after the elections, is that the peaceful nature of the elections held from 1994 till 2019, were in most part due to the fact that it had always been a foregone conclusion that the ANC would win an absolute majority. Now, however, there is for the first time the probability (according to the opinion polls) of the ANC not achieving an outright majority. This means that the election as such, will be no more than the initial scene-setter this time round.\n\nIt is not the 2024 election that will determine the composition of South Africa's next government (if, as predicted, no party wins an absolute majority). It will be those politicians newly elected to parliament, through horse-trading among themselves. Trying to form a stable coalition.\n\nWhich raises these pivotal questions: won't there be just as great an effort AFTER the election to influence the said politicians, as there was prior to it to try and influence the voters? Or will our elected leaders enter into some local equivalent of the Sistine Chapel and there piously apply their minds in earnest genteel debate to who should emerge victorious, guided purely by divine inspiration? Will our populace stand outside, solemnly and with quiet patience in whatever will pass as our St. Peter's Square, waiting passively for white smoke to emerge from some chimney to signal that our new pope has been chosen?\n\nTHE COALITION SCENARIO BRINGS NEW, UNFAMILIAR RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\nThis potential coalition-building scenario is fraught with risk, from a national security perspective:\n\nTHE POLITICIANS KNOW WHAT'S LIKELY COMING AND OBVIOUSLY ARE ALREADY PLANNING FOR IT\n\nIt is not rocket science, grasping that these upcoming realities have already been comprehended by politicians of all stripes. They are certainly already thinking about and planning for how they can best position themselves in the event of such horse-trading. Important in terms of national security assessment, is what each party will be willing and able to actually do, post-election, in order to maximise its influence at the bargaining table (it should here be remembered that we aren't talking only at national level - there are provinces that may end up requiring coalition-forming: KZN most clearly so, but also perhaps the Western Cape, Gauteng - possibly even all of them).\n\nWhat tactics will these parties employ? To what lengths will they be willing to go, nationally as well as with regard to disputed provinces, to further their respective causes? Will they trust in reason alone, or will some of them be willing to turn to physical action, to \"mass mobilisation\" to exert pressure? (As, for example, happened after the last election in the USA).\n\nOne can only go by history. The events of July 2021 speak for themselves, as regards the modus operandi of Team Zuma.\n\nThe spate of political killings already witnessed in KZN underscores that politics in South Africa is a deadly serious affair, not a parlour game. Going back somewhat further, there's the history of tremendous Black-on-Black bloodshed during the run-up to the 1994 election.\n\nThere's also the \"Lusaka\" wing's planning of Operation Vula, which was precisely designed to influence that election and the formation of the first non-racial government through armed violence, if matters had not gone to the their liking (and if the then security forces had not put a stop to Vula). Similarly, SWAPO had attempted the same violent \"strong man\" tactic in Namibia with their ill-fated invasion there on 1 April 1989, in the run-up to that election.\n\nIt is not slandering politicians and parties with their roots in revolutionary politics, to say that they have a different view of violence as political tool - after all, Mao clearly taught them that political power grows from the barrel of a gun.\n\nWHY POLITICIANS MAY BE TEMPTED TO STIR MASS ACTION TO GIVE THEM LEVERAGE DURING THE COALITION-FORMING\n\nA number of factors will make it very tempting for certain politicians to try and influence by means of mass mobilisation and unrest, the post-electoral horse-trading that will likely result from no party winning a clear majority:\n\nA last factor that has to be taken into consideration, is the shifting power balance in the world, plus (related to it) the present trend in Africa regarding anti-imperialism and Africanism. The West is losing its dominance. With so much already currently on its diminishing collective plate (Gaza, Ukraine), the West will not concretely intervene if things start going badly wrong in South Africa after the election.\n\nThe West is actually being forced to withdraw from Africa, particularly the French and the USA (the British have long ago left). This is part of the growing division in the world, as seen from the Third World perspective. A division between \"imperialist\" and \"anti-imperialist\" forces (the West being identified with the former). This ties in with what the economist Arnold Kling wrote a decade ago, about opposing worldviews that lead different groupings to define political debate respectively in terms of struggles between \"civilization and barbarism\" or \"oppressed versus oppressor\" (with the latter being, in recent parlance, anti-imperialist versus imperialist).\n\nThis anti-imperialist, Africanist tendency that we now see sweeping down Africa from its North, is in part connected with the Ukraine conflict and the role of the Russian Federation in trying to oust and substitute the West in Africa. The Russians are pointing out (rightly) to Africans that these Western powers such as France in the sixties had resorted to sham independence simply in order not to be confronted with more wars of national liberation such as they had lost in Indochina and Algeria.\n\nFrom \"independence\" on, the French had manipulated that it would be \"Black\" governments keeping the Black masses in check - but Black governments hand-picked by the French, governing on the French constitutional model. In reality on a \"scratch each other's back\" basis of corruption. This relationship of perpetual dependence was usually achieved through the French elevating the smallest tribe in a country into the new Askaris who must keep the masses under control and allow the French their profit, while being allowed to skim off for themselves.\n\nThe current wave of Africanism coupled with anti-imperialism is a very powerful psychological and nationalist force which, in the South African context, supports the notion that the time has come here as well to replace the Western-style constitutional dispensation of 1994 with an Africanist model.\n\nWhilst many South Africans have dreamt fondly about the day that the ANC meets its come-uppance at the ballot box, the resulting reality may not be an alliance of Western-style moderates that will be taking over.\n\nStatistically, the current members of the new Multi-Party Charter barely achieved 33% of the vote at the last election. What could thus easily result from the ANC not gaining 50% this year, is that another, very different Africanist alliance in fact gain a two-thirds majority. An alliance of essentially the Africanist movements such as MK and the EFF, plus the ANC (now converted to full blown Africanist, in order to still be part of a governing majority) together with a collection of smaller parties such as GOOD. Allowing them collectively a sufficient majority in the new parliament to amend the current constitution.\n\nThe stakes are therefore high, with (ex)revolutionaries smelling opportunity and not much resistance - not locally from security forces nor internationally (in fact, with the likes of the Russian Federation and China lending them support, in order to weaken Western influence in Africa).\n\nThe potential for deliberate instigation of unrest, as well as for the spontaneous escalation there-of, should thus not be under-estimated.\n\nThe obvious first region to focus on is KZN, given Zuma's traditional power base there. Then, the other Zulu-dominated parts of South Africa, such as the North-Eastern Free State, Witwatersrand, and South-Eastern parts of the former Transvaal. Given that there is much more at stake this time than in July 2021 (when the unrest did not break out into the rest of the country), it is quite possible that it may do so now - especially in the case of provinces where no clear winner emerges.\n\nDisaffected areas suffering under crime and abject poverty, where gangs may seize the opportunity, may be especially prone. Another \"soft target\" that may be perceived, and which ties in with the calls from the Africanists for land distribution, is the rural areas. It is conceivable that a state of political confusion may temp these parties to instigate land occupations as providing political leverage and relevance for them, as well as to demonstrate their popular power and dedication to the people.\n\nWHAT COULD SERVE AS CATALYSTS FOR TROUBLE TO BREAK OUT?\n\nApart from the horse-trading phase as general consequence of a \"hung\" parliament described above, trouble could break out even before the elections if Mr Zuma is denied the possibility to be on the MK's candidate list (the Constitutional Court must still finally rule on this). The spate of murders may also trigger unrest, especially if a very high-profile candidate is assassinated.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the election, all eyes will be on the electoral commission. If there is any perceived undue delay in the declaration of the results, or if allegations of fraud are credibly made, then that may lead to calls for mass mobilisation and protest, which may take on a life of its own and spiral into widespread violence.\n\nShould a party decide to use unconstitutional, in effect revolutionary means to demonstrate it strong-man credentials (effectively its ability to hold the country to ransom) then things may turn serious very quickly.\n\nGOING BY WHAT HAPPENED IN JULY 2021, WHAT COULD SUCH A \"MASS ACTION\" STRATEGY POTENTIALLY ENTAIL?\n\nGiven the country's topography and ethnic demographics, there could again be an effort to cut the main trunk roads - likely at the mountain passes (Van Reenen) or chokepoints (Mooi River). This may be accompanied by the disruption of a vital port such as Durban. Actions such as these, especially if the horse-trading phase becomes drawn-out, will present the instigators with considerable leverage over the (interim) government and the business community. It will clearly impact the delivery of fuel and food. (It should not be forgotten that the 1994 election result was, in the end, in fact an \"agreed result\", rather than a mathematically correctly tabulated result, precisely because of such political considerations of avoidance of instability, so that a precedent does exist).\n\nCommunications nowadays depend very much on cell-phone towers, which may again be a target.\n\nEssential infrastructure such as electricity and water supply may also be targeted, as a means to increase frustration and anger and to demonstrate the power to disrupt.\n\nCalling out looters (or land occupiers) is obviously a high-impact manoeuvre, with fire being a cheap and readily available \"weapon of mass destruction\".\n\nPROBABLY THE BIGGEST CONCERN IN THE CASE OF AN OUTBREAK OF VIOLENT UNREST, IS FOR PERSONAL SAFETY\n\nThe best remedy for that is to not be caught unawares and unprepared. There is indeed safety in numbers. It is imperative that families should join local legitimate, officially-recognised community organisations such as Neighbourhood Watches and Community Policing Forums. Avoid the on-the-spur formation of vigilante groups, which can land one in big legal trouble. Associate with the cool heads, not the hotheads.\n\nAvoid an \"us or them\" approach - reach out beyond your own group. Otherwise, preparation (however well intended) can be seen as polarisation and worsen matters.\n\nThe vast majority of South Africans of all colours and creeds are peace-loving, law-abiding citizens who absolutely don't want their communities or livelihoods destroyed. Together, that is a powerful force that one can join, reaching out on a community-wide basis and taking hands. Not to start a fight, but to actually deter conflict by being visibly prepared.\n\nThe bristling Switzerland principle, in other words - make your community so visibly united, prepared and thus formidable, that instigators and the criminal elements will steer well clear of you.\n\nAdopt a two-handed approach: not only preparing to defend your home and community, but also actively reaching out to promote peace and tolerance - such as holding an inter-faith, community-wide church service calling for a peaceful and democratic election, on the Sunday before the election. Reach out to, and unite in a pre-planned manner, all who have much to lose from violent destruction - such as the local taxi association, for example.\n\nAbove all, be informed and prepared, with a proper community safety plan. There are experts who can help with this: General Roland de Vries (who has helped more than 80 communities prepare their safety plans: CLICK HERE), and Mr Johan Botha of the volunteer Sinoville Firefighting Association: https://sbbv.co.za/.\n\nIf things do go seriously wrong for any length of time, then it would be necessary also to be ready to assist refugees from townships, which will in all probability be far more heavily impacted by unrest than the leafy suburbs. This possibility needs to be planned for, as a moral duty and so as not to leave groups of desperate people roaming the streets.\n\nTO CONCLUDE\n\nIn prudently preparing for any eventuality, it is psychologically important not to actually incite an aura of paranoia and polarisation. As said at the outset: South Africa is a land of miracles, and it is quite possible that the first exercise in coalition-forming may go quite smoothly, ringing in a new era of greater imclusivity, cooperation, and progress.\n\nIt would also be wrong to pre-emptively, without concrete proof, accuse any party of definitively planning dastardly deeds - this article certainly does not wish to pretend that the MK party or Mr Zuma, for example, are inevitably and intentionally up to no good.\n\nHowever, as far as proof goes, one can only go by the historical record, which cannot be ignored - therefore, the prudent and responsible thing to do is to plan for the worst whilst also fervently hoping for the best.\n\nBut plan, one must.\n\nAnd pray that the politicians will keep open minds and put the national interest above all else, when the electoral dust has settled, and a government must be formed...", "source": {"uri": "politicsweb.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Moneyweb"},

Its future could depend on who in a field that includes two dominant parties espousing vastly divergent political visions - the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) or Democratic Alliance - the ANC chooses as a coalition partner if it loses its majority, as polls suggest.\n\n\"It's an enormous mark of failure, and it is not sustainable ... We're on a very risky path,\" said Ann Bernstein, director of the Centre for Development and Enterprise, a Johannesburg-based think-tank.\n\nECONOMIC FAILURE\n\nSocial security and economic prosperity were bedrock tenets of ANC policy when it won power under anti-apartheid hero Mandela in 1994.\n\nBut today more than 60% of South Africans live in poverty, according to the World Bank, while a decade of economic stagnation has pushed unemployment above 32%, nearly 10 points higher than 30 years ago. Over a third of the population receives cash grants and other social support.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the government created a new benefit for the working-age unemployed accessed by over 6 million people. Though meant to be temporary, it was extended earlier this year, against the advice of Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana.\n\nFor Thabo Mbeki - an ANC leader and South Africa's president from 1999 to 2008 - the welfare system was never intended to be a cure for poverty and unemployment. Instead, the goal was to grow an inclusive economy so more people could earn an income.\n\n\"That hasn't worked as well as it should. And I think that objective, we need to get back to it,\" he told Reuters.\n\nDalene Raiters lost her job at a local primary school 16 years ago. Her adult son is also jobless. Like many South Africans, their entire family of four lives off the grants of those who qualify.\n\nFor Raiters that means the 1,080 rand ($58) per month she receives for two minor dependents - her teenage boy and grandson supplemented with handouts from a local mosque, feeding schemes or odd jobs she does for neighbours.\n\n\"DOOMSDAY COALITION\" While the ANC denies it will need a coalition, most polls predict an end to its single-party governance after May 29.\n\nThe business-friendly, centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) - the largest opposition party - would seem an awkward fit.\n\nWhile it is promising to increase the value of select grants and convert the pandemic-era payment into a job-seekers grant, it is primarily focused on job creation.\n\nIt wants to relax labour laws and do away with affirmative action aimed at redressing apartheid-era discrimination.\n\nThough the DA squarely blames the ANC for the country's current troubles, it has not ruled out partnering with its ideological opponent to prevent what leader John Steenhuisen dubs a \"doomsday coalition\" of the ANC and the Marxist EFF.\n\n\"I've seen the mass emigration from places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. I've seen the starvation,\" Steenhuisen told Reuters. \"I don't want that for South Africa.\"\n\nThe EFF, which has stated its desire for the finance portfolio were it to partner with the ANC, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.\n\nIts demands for land redistribution and the nationalisation of mines and banks have long spooked investors.\n\nAnd its election manifesto calls for a doubling of existing social benefits across the board, the establishment of a new grant for unemployed university graduates and more free public services for the poor.\n\nMichael Sachs, an economist at the Southern Centre for Inequality Studies, said the system currently has the resources to support its intended beneficiaries: children and pensioners.\n\nWhat it can't do is cope with the effects of skyrocketing unemployment and formal sector stagnation.\n\n\"If those social problems continue to mount and the only answer of government is to provide more social grants, then eventually it will become unsustainable, definitely,\" he said.\n\nFor Raiters, the answer isn't more welfare benefits: only work will give the next generation a chance.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to live a long time,\" she said. \"But for the future, I hope my grandson can get a better job.\"\n\n($1 = 18.5653 rand)\n\n(Reporting by Kopano Gumbi and Joe Bavier; Additional reporting by Sisipho Skweyiya, Sfundo Parakozov, Tim Cocks and Nellie Peyton; Editing by Catherine Evans)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Clearly they are rather spooked ahead of the elections at the end of the month and understandably worried about the polls that give them support as low as 40%. But polls aren't always spot on and maybe the consolation for the ANC is that there is still a 40% chance that useful idiots who clearly haven't been paying much attention to what has been happening these past thirty years will still vote ANC.\n\nLast week Thabo Mbeki (who was not the best loved of our presidents admittedly) came out to bat for the ANC with the astonishing statement that the ANC, rather like Old Mother Hubbard, found the cupboard bare when they came to power in 1994. Just a tiny office with a few broken chairs. The pencils had all been swiped and nobody could find the key to the men's toilet.

Picture: REUTERS/SIPHIWE SIBEKO\n\nThe ANC, fighting to extend its 30-year grip on power in the May 29 elections, would like to cast the government programmes that support Dalene Raiters and her family as a success story.\n\nBut the 48-year-old does not see it that way.\n\n\"The ANC, I don't want to even talk to them,\" an angry Raiters told Reuters from the single room in Johannesburg she shares with her sons and grandson. \"[Nelson] Mandela's dream is not their dream.\"\n\nThe ANC is touting SA's welfare system -- a developing world rarity -- as a landmark achievement amid record high unemployment and a moribund economy.\n\n\"These grants and subsidies do much more than give people what they need to live,\" President Cyril Ramaphosa said in February. \"They are an investment in the future.\"\n\nBut the growing number of people requiring assistance -- more than 24-million in 2024, against a tax base of just 7.1-million -- is straining the system. Its future could depend on whether it chooses the EFF or DA as a coalition partner if it loses its majority, as polls suggest.\n\n\"It's an enormous mark of failure, and it is not sustainable.... We're on a very risky path,\" said Ann Bernstein, director of the Centre for Development and Enterprise.\n\nEconomic failure\n\nSocial security and economic prosperity were bedrock tenets of ANC policy in 1994.\n\nBut today more than 60% of South Africans live in poverty, according to the World Bank, while a decade of economic stagnation has pushed unemployment above 32%, nearly 10 points higher than 30 years ago. More than a third of the population receives cash grants and other social support.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the government created the social relief of distress (SRD) grant, a new benefit for working-age unemployed people, which has accessed by more than 6-million people. Though meant to be temporary, it was extended earlier in 2024, against the advice of finance minister Enoch Godongwana.\n\nFor Thabo Mbeki, the welfare system was never intended to be a cure for poverty and unemployment. Instead, the goal was to grow an inclusive economy so more people could earn an income.\n\n\"That hasn't worked as well as it should. And I think that objective, we need to get back to it,\" he said.\n\nRaiters lost her job at a local primary school 16 years ago. Her adult son is also jobless. Like many South Africans, their entire family of four lives off the grants of those who qualify.\n\nFor Raiters that means the R1,080 a month she receives for two minor dependents -- her teenage boy and grandson supplemented with handouts from a local mosque, feeding schemes or odd jobs she does for neighbours.\n\nWhile the ANC denies it will need a coalition, most polls predict an end to its single-party governance after May 29.\n\nThe DA would seem an awkward fit. While it is promising to increase the value of select grants and convert the SRD grant into a jobseekers grant, it is primarily focused on job creation. It also wants to relax labour laws and do away with affirmative action.\n\nThough the DA squarely blames the ANC for the country's current troubles, it has not ruled out partnering with its ideological opponent to prevent what leader John Steenhuisen dubs a \"doomsday coalition\" of the ANC and the EFF.\n\n\"I've seen the mass emigration from places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. I've seen the starvation,\" Steenhuisen said. \"I don't want that for SA.\"\n\nThe EFF, which has stated its desire for the finance portfolio were it to partner with the ANC, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview.\n\nThe party's election manifesto calls for a doubling of existing social benefits across the board, the establishment of a new grant for unemployed university graduates and more free public services for the poor.\n\nSouthern Centre for Inequality Studies economist Michael Sachs said the system currently had the resources to support its intended beneficiaries: children and pensioners.\n\nWhat it cannot do is cope with the effects of skyrocketing unemployment and formal sector stagnation.\n\n\"If those social problems continue to mount and the only answer of government is to provide more social grants, then eventually it will become unsustainable, definitely,\" he said.\n\nFor Raiters, the answer is not more welfare benefits: only work will give the next generation a chance.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to live a long time,\" she said. \"But for the future, I hope my grandson can get a better job.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za",

As part of pre-election coverage, Daily Maverick visited the area while the ANC was campaigning in the area.\n\nMsunduzi is limping along, revealing why the ANC is struggling in its KZN heartland as traditional leaders complain about water, broken roads and promises and unsafe scholar bridges.\n\nSince democracy, the area has been an ANC stronghold at local level until dropping to 47% in the 2021 local government elections.\n\nA drive through Mafunze village is mostly pleasant as the roads have been tarred and are in good condition, with the fresh countryside breeze and tranquillity a welcome treat for city dwellers.\n\nHowever, behind this facade, members of the Mafunze Royal Palace raised myriad issues.\n\nDaily Maverick was following ANC first deputy secretary-general Nomvula Mokonyane on her campaign trail on Tuesday. It kicked off at the Mafunze Royal Palace, where the ANC leader, flanked by Msunduzi Municipality mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla, paid a courtesy visit to Chief Maviyo Ngcobo and his family.\n\nAfter welcoming Mokonyane and her entourage, they all sat in the TV room where the chief appeared to be watching soapies.\n\nAddressing Mokonyane, the chief's brother, Shongani Ngcobo, said residents had a problem accessing water. Many had to walk long distances to access water, which was an inconvenience.\n\n\"Water is a need and yes there is clean water, but we would like the ANC to bring it closer to us. So, we are not told that there are small volumes of water coming to the community. The only source of water is spring water from underground but we need a company that can channel that water to us because it's enough. There is also water from the mountain that we use. Because we have water from underground, we can also make boreholes a source,\" he said.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: KwaZulu-Natal set for fierce battle as four parties vie for votes in 2024 election\n\nHe noted that there were two bridges that could become a safety hazard if not fixed.\n\n\"We were once visited by [Minister of Higher Education] Blade Nzimande and we told him about these bridges. The issue is, they are made out of wooden blocks and are used by children who have to go to school. They collapse at any point and hurt our community.\"\n\nNgcobo also mentioned that residents needed more support to stimulate agricultural projects in the area.\n\n\"When we were growing up in Mafunze, we used to grow our own mielie meal and beans. We do have land to plant seeds and our land is fertile. The issue is [that] there is no clear demarcation so cattle can graze there whenever they want. So, we need our land to be divided properly,\" he said.\n\n\"We also have many competent small-scale farmers in the area.

We have a team we have dispatched on the ground to deal with this. We have a catchment where the JoJo tanks will use this water as a short- term solution,\" he said.\n\nAs for the roads and bridges that are in bad condition, Thebolla said they would be fixed by summer.\n\nThis is despite the municipality being under administration in terms of Section 139 (1) (b) for more than five years, with recent news that it might no longer be required to be under administration.\n\nThe Msunduzi Municipality has been flagged by the Cooperative Governance Department for failing to take control of the city's finances, a lack of consequence management, and failure to prevent irregular and unauthorised expenditure.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Strides made to rescue run-down Pietermaritburg, says mayor - financial viability still a monumental challenge\n\nJust 20 minutes from Mfunze is Henryville, a semi-rural area with mostly dilapidated homes, housing families of up to seven people, not far from where Minister Nzimande grew up.\n\nThe area has mostly mud houses that are barely furnished and inadequately fenced yards.\n\nMokonyane, her team and a small group of ANC volunteers visited a number of homes, including that of Mama Magdalene Hlengwa.\n\nIn her home, Hlengwa appeared to be expecting visitors and was wearing a traditional dress, a hat and pearls.\n\nHer home was run down, with kitchen walls substituted with different materials.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: ANC silences eThekwini and southern KZN critics while IFP makes pronounced gains in provincial north\n\nShe smiled when the ANC delegation arrived, and recalled how tough conditions were in the apartheid era. \"We used to have to find a place to hide when the police would come around. We have been part of the ANC for many years, even before you,\" she said.\n\nMokonyane assured her that the ANC would help to fix her home, and also encouraged her to vote.\n\nAnother problem in the area is crime, including the most notable incident in which eight people burnt to death in Pietermaritzburg in May 2023.\n\nThe previous month, 10 family members - eight women and two males, including a 14-year-old boy - were shot dead in a homestead massacre.\n\nThe rise in crime prompted MEC for economic development, tourism and environmental affairs and leader of government business, Siboniso Duma, to hold an imbizo at Imbali in 2023.\n\nDuma unveiled key interventions to curb the unprecedented rise in murder, rape, gender-based violence and femicide as well as the mushrooming narcotics trade and illegal liquor outlets.\n\nA Henryville resident told Daily Maverick she feels residents are not safe. \"There are people whose houses get broken into and we can barely get help because the police station is far.

Same with us, we have to reclaim and prepare a takeover of the lost metros in South Africa.\"\n\nThe South African opposition was quick to point to Zanu-PF's problematic electoral record as news spread of the development on Thursday.\n\nMmusi Maimane's Build One South Africa (Bosa) said it was \"widely accepted\" that the Zimbabwean ruling party \"rigs elections in Zimbabwe to favour itself and to continue its misrule of the party\".\n\nZanu-PF \"has presided over an autocratic, authoritarian and repressive regime\", Bosa said.\n\nMaimane's party had a message for Zanu-PF: \"They are not welcome in South Africa.\"\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA), meanwhile, charged that the ANC's invitation to Zanu-PF to participate in its campaign programme \"amounts to political interference with our elections\".\n\nThe party did not elaborate on which provisions of the Electoral Act it believed the ANC had violated through this, but said it would lodge a complaint with the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) over a \"foreign political party\" actively \"pursuing a partisan political agenda on behalf of the ANC\".\n\nThe DA noted that after Zimbabwe's most recent elections in August 2023, which saw President Emmerson Mnangagwa win a second term, election observers, including the regional SADC Election Observer Mission, had raised concerns over the freedom and fairness of the polls.\n\nThe ANC, however, endorsed the election results -- and considers Zanu-PF a sister party.\n\nSome commentators suggested it was hypocritical to want election observers to monitor South Africa's 29 May elections only if they are from Western countries.\n\nRise Mzansi's spokesperson, Gugu Ndima, said the DA's controversial appeal to the US and to the European Union in March to send election observers to South Africa was disingenuous when contrasted with the party's outrage over the Zimbabwean invitation.\n\nNdima said both the DA and ANC's appeals were problematic, given that both the Zimbabwean and the US political systems were marked by \"elections controversy\", and given that both parties had issued direct invitations without involving the IEC.\n\nShe said: \"As Rise Mzansi, we fully support the standard practice of having election observers, whether they come from Zimbabwe or the US, but this must be managed by the appropriate authority, that being the Electoral Commission.\"\n\nThe IEC itself has expressed a similar sentiment.\n\nIEC CEO Sy Mamabolo said the DA's appeal to Western governments was procedurally unorthodox.\n\n\"The commission believes that elections must be observed because observation gives us credibility,\" Mamobolo was quoted as saying at the time.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we are alive to the fact that the letter by the DA is directly to an executive in another country. That is not how ordinarily the observation process works. Often the observation works at a multilateral level: AU, SADC and so on.\"\n\nAt the time, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the DA's invitation to Western powers, saying: \"For a non-state entity to do something like that is basically saying we are mortgaging our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It has also shown that new coalitions could emerge in provinces hitherto governed by the ANC.\n\nSuch an outcome would represent a significant change for the country, as well as a dramatic decline for the ANC itself, whose electoral support peaked at nearly 67% in 2004 and came in at a comfortable 57% in 2019.\n\nA key question, therefore, is how far below the 50% threshold the ANC will fall. Some polls have indicated that its share of the vote could fall to below 40%, even though few anticipate such a calamitous slump. Nevertheless, the coalition permutations should the ANC fall below 45% are potentially unsettling for the currency, investors, business, and the reforms under way in the electricity, freight logistics, water, and tourism sectors.\n\nThe permutation anticipated to be most disruptive to the reform momentum is one where the ANC turns to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Such a coalition is already in place in the Gauteng metropolitan council of Ekurhuleni. And the ANC's populist Gauteng Premier, Panyaza Lesufi, has openly defied national instructions not to align with the EFF, given his recognition that prospects for securing a majority absent a coalition with the EFF are slim.\n\nShould such a coalition remain restricted to the provinces, even one as economically significant as Gauteng, business sentiment and the reforms agenda will be dented but not seriously damaged. Should it extend to the national level, however, the reaction is likely to be far more intense and long-lasting.\n\nThe question then will be whether the reform agenda being implemented by President Cyril Ramaphosa's government will be sustained and whether Ramaphosa himself will remain.\n\nA coalition with the EFF would certainly slow the reforms, and make Ramaphosa's position extremely precarious. In some cases, the reforms will be abandoned. Once the challenges of governance become clearer, though, it is unlikely that they will all be halted, particularly when doing so could result in a swing back to politically harmful crises such as daily loadshedding.\n\nAnother possible scenario if the ANC falls below 45% is to force a grand centralist coalition with the Democratic Alliance (DA).\n\nIn the short term, this would be a business-friendly outcome and growth- and reform-supportive. However, it would be a hard sell internally for both parties and would de-fang the DA as an opposition force, potentially leaving more unstable parties to occupy that crucial position.\n\nThe least destabilising, albeit uninspiring, outcome is arguably one where the ANC secures 45%-plus and cobbles together a majority with small parties.\n\nGiven these stakes, falling levels of engagement by the electorate are worrying.", "source": {"uri": "engineeringnews.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Engineering News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terence_creamer@engineeringnews.co.za", "name": "Terence Creamer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provinces of South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Freedom_Fighters", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic Freedom Fighters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gauteng"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panyaza_Lesufi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panyaza Lesufi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ekurhuleni_Metropolitan_Municipality", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Gauteng", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Gauteng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyril Ramaphosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_blackout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling blackout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralized_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centralized government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Alliance_(South_Africa)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Alliance (South Africa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001129829_resized_terencecreamereditorinsight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546540", "eventUri": "eng-9546540", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 452988068, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 51, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 51}}}

Corruption in private and the public sector, high crime rates where least 130 cases of rape and an average 84 murders happen daily are some the challenges confronting the ANC government.\n\nPossible election outcomes\n\nDA, EFF and Multi-Party Charter are unlikely going to have outright majority wins. Among the three political entities, though in the opposition, they do not share similar ideological orientations, hence their credibility test is questionable.\n\nBased on current polls, the most likely scenario is that ANC is either going to lose its absolute majority in Parliament or will scrap a slim majority victory. In the event of losing its majority, it will join forces with smaller, primarily centrist parties to form a coalition in exchange for policy concessions.\n\nEFF is also thought to be a likely outfit to enter into coalition with ANC, however, the South African economy has already responded negatively to an ostensibly coalition of the two.\n\nAsset allocators have started hedging against a potential ANC-EFF coalition, scared that such a government union could result in capital outflows, damagingly impacting investor sentiment.\n\nANC and the EFF have already shown that they can work together. Last November, the ANC parliamentarians joined EFF in their proposal to have the Israeli embassy in SA closed amid that country's war with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nEFF also supported the ANC government when it raised a case of genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza by the Israeli government in January.\n\nSecondly, any potential coalition will place ANC at the centre of policy making to give meaningful improvements to where the party has failed and return to the 1994 values it was committed to.\n\nA coalition government led by ANC is unlikely to disrupt the continuity of energy policy, justice for the people of Palestine and continued efforts to meet the people's demands.\n\nANC knows that its house is not as orderly as it should be, but it is wearing a brave face.\n\nThe rise of the MK has been dismissed by ANC as a non-event and not \"formidable\" compared to Congress of the People (COPE).\n\nCOPE, a breakaway faction from ANC, was founded in December 2008 ahead of the 2009 elections and won 30 parliamentary seats.\n\nYet, the rise of MK might indicate a turning point for ANC, which is giving emphasis that the people must vote with Palestine and 1994 in mind.\n\nThe impact of the 1994 election moment in South Africa must not be undermined.\n\nIt brought to people a relief after years of colonialism and apartheid to give legitimacy to the majority of the black majority that was led by ANC.\n\nWith political swings moving fast, it remains to be seen how ANC will give direction to its members in anticipation of being the next government.\n\nThe revolutionary party has remained hopeful even when facing the threat of external besmirch by the USA that it was supplying weapons of war to Russia.", "source": {"uri": "manicapost.co.zw", "dataType": "news",

The biomarker cutoff values were applied to primary and secondary care cohorts (307 and 200 patients, respectively); the blood test was then evaluated prospectively in the primary and secondary care cohorts (208 and 398 patients, respectively). The ratio of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) to non-p-tau217 (expressed as percentage of p-tau217) alone and when combined with the amyloid-\u03b2 42 and amyloid-\u03b2 40 (A\u03b242:A\u03b240) plasma ratio (APS2) was determined.\n\nThe researchers found that 50 percent of patients had AD pathology in the primary and secondary care assessments. High diagnostic accuracy was seen in all four cohorts (primary and secondary care cohorts and prospective primary and secondary care cohorts; range, 88 to 92 percent). Diagnostic accuracy for identifying clinical AD was 61 percent for primary care physicians after clinical examination, cognitive testing, and a computed tomographic scan and 73 percent for dementia specialists compared with 91 percent using the APS2.

However, the use of these agents requires amyloid confirmation.\n\nA key finding of the study was that primary care physicians had a diagnostic accuracy of 61%, and dementia specialists had an accuracy of 73%, after completing standard clinical evaluations and before seeing results of the blood test or other AD biomarkers, while the blood test used in the study had an accuracy of 91% for correctly classifying clinical, biomarker-verified AD.\n\n\"This underscores the potential improvement in diagnostic accuracy, especially in primary care, when implementing such a blood test,\" study investigator Sebastian Palmqvist, MD, PhD, associate professor of neurology at Lund University, Lund, and a consultant at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, Malm\u00f6, Sweden, told Medscape Medical News.\n\n\"It also highlights the challenges in accurately identifying AD based solely on clinical evaluation and cognitive testing, even for specialists.\"\n\nThe findings were presented on July 28 at Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) 2024 and simultaneously published online in JAMA.\n\nThe study included two cohorts from primary and secondary care clinics in Sweden. Researchers analyzed plasma samples together at one timepoint in a single batch.\n\nIt also included two cohorts from Swedish primary and secondary care clinics where the plasma samples were analyzed prospectively (biweekly) in batches throughout the enrollment period, which more closely resembles clinical practice.\n\nPrimary care physicians and dementia specialists documented whether they believed their patients had AD pathology, basing the diagnoses on the standard evaluation that includes clinical examination, cognitive testing, and a CT scan prior to seeing any AD biomarker results.\n\nThey reported their certainty of the presence of AD pathology on a scale from 0 (not at all certain) to 10 (completely certain).\n\nPlasma analyses were performed by personnel blinded to all clinical or biomarker data. Mass spectrometry assays were used to analyze A\u03b242, A\u03b240, phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), and non-p-tau217.\n\nBiomarkers used in the study included the percentage of plasma p-tau217, which is the ratio of p-tau217 relative to non-p-tau217, and the A\u03b242 to A\u03b240 ratio (the amyloid probability score 2 [APS2]). Researchers determined p-tau217 alone and when combined with the APS2.\n\nThe study included 1213 patients with cognitive symptoms -- mean age 74.2 years and 48% women. Researchers applied biomarker cutoff values to the primary care cohort (n = 307) and the secondary care cohort (n = 300) and then evaluated the blood test prospectively in the primary care cohort (n = 208) and the secondary care cohort (n = 398).\n\nThe blood biomarker cutoff value was set at 90% specificity for AD pathology (the 1 cutoff-value approach). A 2 cutoff-value approach (using 1 upper and 1 lower cutoff value) was also used with values corresponding to 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity.\n\nThe primary outcome was presence of AD pathology. A positive finding of the A\u03b2 biomarker was defined according to the FDA-approved cutoff value (\u2264 0.072). A positive finding of the tau biomarker was defined as a p-tau217 level > 11.42 pg/mL in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nResearchers calculated the positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy, as well as area under the curve (AUC) values.\n\nWhen the plasma samples were analyzed in a single batch in the primary care cohort, the AUC was 0.97 when the APS2 was used. In the secondary care cohort, the AUC was 0.96 when the APS2 was used.\n\nWhen plasma samples were analyzed prospectively (biweekly) in the primary care cohort, the AUC was 0.96 when the APS2 was used. In the secondary care cohort, the AUC was 0.97 when the APS2 was used.\n\nThe 2 cutoff-value approach achieved PPVs of 97%-99% in patients with cognitive impairment, which is the target population of currently available anti-amyloid treatments.\n\nAlthough NPVs were slightly lower in these patients (87%-92% using the APS2), \"we argue that a very high positive predictive value is probably more important in diagnosing patients as having Alzheimer's disease, especially before initiating costly and burdensome anti-amyloid treatment,\" the investigators noted.\n\nThe PPVs were less than optimal for accurate identification of AD pathology in patients with subjective cognitive decline regardless of the cutoff-value approach used. The researchers pointed out that this could be a disadvantage for clinical trials that include patients with presymptomatic AD but not in clinical practice because there are no clinical criteria for diagnosing AD at the subjective cognitive decline stage.\n\nThe NPVs were higher in patients with subjective cognitive decline (91%-94% for the APS2 or percentage of p-tau217 alone). This indicates the blood test would be more useful for ruling out underlying AD when only subtle symptoms are present, the researchers noted.\n\nAs for doctors identifying clinical AD, primary care physicians had a diagnostic accuracy of 61% (95% CI, 53%-69%) vs 91% (95% CI, 86%-96%) using the APS2. Dementia specialists had a diagnostic accuracy of 73% (95% CI, 68%-79%) vs 91% (95% CI, 86%-95%) using the APS2.\n\nIn the overall population, the diagnostic accuracy using the APS2 (90%; 95% CI, 88%-92%) was not different from that using the percentage of p-tau217 alone (90%; 95% CI, 88%-91%).\n\nVery little was known about how a blood test would perform in a primary care setting, said Palmqvist. \"Seeing that the test was just as accurate in primary care (about 90%) as it was in secondary care is really encouraging, especially since primary care is the first, and often final, point of entry into the healthcare system for cognitive evaluations.\"\n\nHe said he was surprised the biomarkers performed so well in prospective, biweekly analyses throughout the study. \"Previous studies have only demonstrated their effectiveness when all collected samples are analyzed at a single timepoint, which does not reflect how a blood test is used in clinical practice,\" he said.\n\nHe added that he was surprised that the tests were just as accurate in primary care as in a memory clinic setting with referred patients. This, despite older age and higher prevalence of comorbidities in primary care, such as chronic kidney disease (present in 26% of the primary care cohort), can be a confounding factor causing increased concentrations of p-tau217.\n\nThe diagnostic accuracy of the blood tests is on par with FDA-cleared cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, the investigators, with senior author Professor Oskar Hansson, MD, PhD, Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malmo\u0308, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden, noted.\n\nAs blood tests are \"more time-effective, cost-effective, and convenient\" for patients, \"they could also potentially replace cerebrospinal fluid tests and PET,\" they added.\n\nPalmqvist emphasized that these tests should not be used as stand-alone diagnostic tools for AD but should complement the standard clinical evaluation that includes cognitive testing and a thorough interview with the patient and a spouse or relative.\n\n\"This is crucial because Alzheimer's disease pathology can be asymptomatic for many years, and cognitive symptoms in some patients with AD pathology may primarily result from other conditions. Misinterpreting a positive AD blood test could lead to underdiagnosis of common non-AD conditions.\"\n\nWith new anti-amyloid treatments possibly slowing disease progression by 30%-40% when initiated early on, a blood test for AD could lead to more people receiving an accurate and earlier diagnosis, said Palmqvist. \"This could potentially result in a better response to treatment. Results from drug trials clearly indicate that the earlier treatment begins, the more effectively it can slow disease progression.\"\n\nThe test used in the study is already available in the United States, the investigators said, and similar test will be accessible in Sweden within a few months. \"However, the rollout will probably be gradual and will depend on how international and national guidelines recommend their use, so developing these guidelines will be a crucial next step for widespread implementation, particularly in primary care,\" said Palmqvist.\n\nHe also underlined the importance of replicating the findings in more diverse populations. \"This will help ensure the tests' reliability and effectiveness across various demographic and clinical contexts.\"\n\nAn important next research step is to examine how implementing a blood test for AD affects patient care. \"This includes looking at changes in management, such as referrals, other examinations, and the initiation of appropriate treatments,\" said Palmqvist.\n\nAnother study presented at the meeting showed that a highly accurate blood test could significantly reduce diagnostic wait times.\n\nIn an accompanying editorial, Stephen Salloway, MD, Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, The Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island, and colleagues said the study \"makes the case convincingly that highly sensitive blood measures of Alzheimer's disease can be integrated into the clinical decision-making process, including in the primary care setting.\"\n\nThese tests, they wrote, \"can be used to enhance the ability of clinicians to accurately identify individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\n\"Current practice should focus on using these blood biomarkers in individuals with cognitive impairment rather than in those with normal cognition or subjective cognitive decline until further research demonstrates effective interventions for individuals considered cognitively normal with elevated levels of amyloid.\"\n\nA key limitation of the study was the lack of diversity in the study sample. This makes it difficult to generalize the results across other ethnic and racial groups, the editorialists noted. Plasma assays for AD in the United States will require approval from the FDA and coverage by the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to be widely adopted.\n\nThe editorialists also pointed out that advances in the diagnosis and treatment of AD will require important changes to healthcare models, including providing additional resources and staffing.\n\nThe study was supported by the Alzheimer's Association, National Institute on Aging, European Research Council, Swedish Research Council, the GHR Foundation, and other groups.\n\nThe study was conducted as an academic collaboration between Lund University and C2N Diagnostics in the United States. Lund University or its affiliated researchers received no funding or compensation from C2N Diagnostics. C2N Diagnostics performed the plasma analyses blinded to any biomarker or clinical data and had no role in the statistical analysis or results.\n\nPalmqvist reported receiving institutional research

The APS2 had high diagnostic accuracy (range, 88%-92%) for detecting Alzheimer disease pathology in both primary and secondary care. Dementia specialists identified clinical Alzheimer disease with a diagnostic accuracy of 73% vs 91% using the APS2 and primary care physicians had a diagnostic accuracy of 61% vs 91% using the APS2.\n\nMeaning This blood test (the APS2) had high diagnostic accuracy for identifying Alzheimer disease among individuals with cognitive symptoms in primary and secondary care, providing superior performance compared with the diagnostic accuracy after standard clinical evaluation (not using Alzheimer disease biomarkers).\n\nImportance An accurate blood test for Alzheimer disease (AD) could streamline the diagnostic workup and treatment of AD.\n\nObjective To prospectively evaluate a clinically available AD blood test in primary care and secondary care using predefined biomarker cutoff values.\n\nDesign, Setting, and Participants There were 1213 patients undergoing clinical evaluation due to cognitive symptoms who were examined between February 2020 and January 2024 in Sweden. The biomarker cutoff values had been established in an independent cohort and were applied to a primary care cohort (n\u2009=\u2009307) and a secondary care cohort (n\u2009=\u2009300); 1 plasma sample per patient was analyzed as part of a single batch for each cohort. The blood test was then evaluated prospectively in the primary care cohort (n\u2009=\u2009208) and in the secondary care cohort (n\u2009=\u2009398); 1 plasma sample per patient was sent for analysis within 2 weeks of collection.\n\nExposure Blood tests based on plasma analyses by mass spectrometry to determine the ratio of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) to non-p-tau217 (expressed as percentage of p-tau217) alone and when combined with the amyloid-\u03b2 42 and amyloid-\u03b2 40 (A\u03b242:A\u03b240) plasma ratio (the amyloid probability score 2 [APS2]).\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was AD pathology (determined by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio and p-tau217). The secondary outcome was clinical AD. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated.\n\nResults The mean age was 74.2 years (SD, 8.3 years), 48% were women, 23% had subjective cognitive decline, 44% had mild cognitive impairment, and 33% had dementia. In both the primary care and secondary care assessments, 50% of patients had AD pathology. When the plasma samples were analyzed in a single batch in the primary care cohort, the AUC was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99) when the APS2 was used, the PPV was 91% (95% CI, 87%-96%), and the NPV was 92% (95% CI, 87%-96%); in the secondary care cohort, the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98) when the APS2 was used, the PPV was 88% (95% CI, 83%-93%), and the NPV was 87% (95% CI, 82%-93%). When the plasma samples were analyzed prospectively (biweekly) in the primary care cohort, the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98) when the APS2 was used, the PPV was 88% (95% CI, 81%-94%), and the NPV was 90% (95% CI, 84%-96%); in the secondary care cohort, the AUC was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98) when the APS2 was used, the PPV was 91% (95% CI, 87%-95%), and the NPV was 91% (95% CI, 87%-95%). The diagnostic accuracy was high in the 4 cohorts (range, 88%-92%). Primary care physicians had a diagnostic accuracy of 61% (95% CI, 53%-69%) for identifying clinical AD after clinical examination, cognitive testing, and a computed tomographic scan vs 91% (95% CI, 86%-96%) using the APS2. Dementia specialists had a diagnostic accuracy of 73% (95% CI, 68%-79%) vs 91% (95% CI, 88%-95%) using the APS2. In the overall population, the diagnostic accuracy using the APS2 (90% [95% CI, 88%-92%]) was not different from the diagnostic accuracy using the percentage of p-tau217 alone (90% [95% CI, 88%-91%]).\n\nConclusions and Relevance The APS2 and percentage of p-tau217 alone had high diagnostic accuracy for identifying AD among individuals with cognitive symptoms in primary and secondary care using predefined cutoff values. Future studies should evaluate how the use of blood tests for these biomarkers influences clinical care.\n\nOne in 5 women and 1 in 10 men develop dementia due to Alzheimer disease. Individuals with cognitive symptoms are first seen in primary care, with a minority being referred to secondary care. Symptomatic Alzheimer disease is misdiagnosed in 25% to 35% of patients treated at specialized clinics and likely even more patients treated in primary care. Tests sometimes available only at specialized clinics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or the collection of cerebrospinal fluid to assess Alzheimer disease biomarkers, reduce the rate of misdiagnosis.\n\nTwo antiamyloid immunotherapies have been approved for the treatment of patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer disease, and other treatments are likely to follow. Initiation of treatment requires biomarker-positive test results for Alzheimer disease, leading to increased need for biomarker testing. However, primary care physicians lack accessible and reliable biomarker tools to diagnose Alzheimer disease. Even in secondary care, there is limited availability of cerebrospinal fluid and PET examinations. The lack of accessible testing methods for Alzheimer disease biomarkers is a substantial obstacle to the initiation and effective use of antiamyloid immunotherapies to treat patients with Alzheimer disease.\n\nThese issues have driven the development of Alzheimer disease blood biomarker tests with potential for high accessibility in both primary and secondary care. The most promising is plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), which is strongly associated with Alzheimer disease pathology in cerebrospinal fluid and in Alzheimer disease biomarkers measured by PET, in addition to neuropathological changes in patients with Alzheimer disease. A blood test based on the ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 (expressed as percentage of p-tau217) can be used to account for the influence of non-Alzheimer disease-related factors on plasma p-tau217 concentrations. The diagnostic accuracy of p-tau217 can improve when combined with the amyloid-\u03b2 42 and amyloid-\u03b2 40 (A\u03b242:A\u03b240) plasma ratio.\n\nThe percentage of plasma p-tau217 has recently been shown to provide comparable diagnostic accuracy (90%) as clinically approved cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (vs 91% using the p-tau to A\u03b242 ratio and 87% using the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio) in individuals with cognitive impairment assessed in secondary care using A\u03b2 PET. Although assessments using these blood biomarkers are promising, several knowledge gaps hinder their clinical implementation. The biomarkers must be validated in primary care and compared with standard clinical assessments in terms of diagnostic accuracy. The biomarkers must also be accurate when using predefined cutoff values and continuous analysis of samples (similar to clinical practice).\n\nIn both the primary and secondary care cohorts, we aimed to (1) examine the ability of plasma percentage of p-tau217 alone and when combined with the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 plasma ratio (the amyloid probability score 2 [APS2]) to detect Alzheimer disease pathology or clinical Alzheimer disease in patients with cognitive symptoms using predefined cutoff values; (2) evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers when analyzed in batches prospectively (biweekly); and (3) compare the diagnostic accuracy of blood biomarkers with the diagnostic accuracy of primary care physicians or dementia specialists. Secondary objectives were to (1) examine the performance at different cognitive stages and (2) compare different cutoff value approaches for the blood test.\n\nAll participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority. The study report adheres to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) recommendations. The study included 2 cohorts from primary and secondary care clinics at which the plasma samples were analyzed together at 1 time point in a single batch. The study also included 2 cohorts from primary and secondary care clinics at which the plasma samples were analyzed prospectively in batches biweekly (ie, twice monthly) throughout the enrollment period, which is more similar to clinical practice. Only 1 plasma sample per patient was analyzed.\n\nPatients in the 2 primary care cohorts were recruited at 17 primary care centers in southern Sweden (12 public and 5 private primary care centers) from February 2020 to October 2022 (single-batch analysis) and from October 2022 to October 2023 (prospective, biweekly batch analysis) as part of the prospective BioFINDER Primary Care study (NCT06120361), which consecutively includes patients undergoing investigation for a dementia diagnosis in primary care. Patients in the single-batch analysis in secondary care were recruited at the Memory Clinic of Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital or the Memory Clinic of \u00c4ngelholm Hospital in Sweden as part of the BioFINDER 2 study (NCT03174938) from January 2019 to November 2023.\n\nFor the prospective, biweekly analysis in secondary care, patients were recruited as part of the BioFINDER Memory Clinic study (NCT06122415) from December 2022 to January 2024 at the Memory Clinic of Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital. Further cohort details appear in the eMethods in Supplement 1.\n\nPatients were classified as having subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia based on cognitive test results and clinical assessments, independent of underlying etiology and Alzheimer disease biomarker results (described in the eMethods in Supplement 1).\n\nIn the prospectively analyzed primary and secondary care cohorts, primary care physicians and dementia specialists documented whether they thought their patients had Alzheimer disease pathology. The physicians based their diagnoses of Alzheimer disease on the standard evaluation (clinical examination, cognitive testing, and a computed tomographic scan) prior to seeing any Alzheimer disease biomarker results. The certainty of the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology was reported on a scale from 0 (not at all certain) to 10 (completely certain). In a secondary analysis, physicians were also asked if they thought their patients had clinical Alzheimer disease (ie, symptoms caused by Alzheimer disease pathology). Additional details appear in the eMethods in Supplement 1.\n\nPlasma handling procedures are described in the eMethods in Supplement 1. The plasma analyses were performed while all personnel analyzing the samples were blinded to all clinical or biomarker data. Mass spectrometry assays (C2N Diagnostics) were used to analyze the following biomarkers: A\u03b242, A\u03b240, p-tau217, and non-p-tau217 (eMethods in Supplement 1).\n\nThe PrecivityAD2 blood test algorithm is a logistic regression model trained in an independent cohort to estimate amyloid positivity using a combination of plasma A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio and percentage of p-tau217. The probability output (score range, 0-100) of the logistic regression model is referred to as the APS2 (eMethods in Supplement 1).\n\nCerebrospinal fluid was collected and handled according to a standardized protocol, and the biomarkers A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 were analyzed at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital clinical chemistry laboratory using the Lumipulse assays, which have been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The biomarker p-tau217 was analyzed on the MesoScale Discovery platform using an assay developed by Lilly.\n\nThe 82 participants who did not undergo cerebrospinal fluid sampling (because they were unable to undergo lumbar puncture) in the primary care cohorts instead underwent flutemetamol PET imaging (described in the eMethods in Supplement 1).\n\nThe primary outcome was presence of Alzheimer disease pathology, which was defined according to the 2018 National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association criteria as A\u03b2 and tau positivity. A positive finding of the A\u03b2 biomarker was defined according to the FDA-approved cutoff value (\u22640.072) using the Lumipulse assay for A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio based on cerebrospinal fluid. A positive finding of the tau biomarker was defined as a p-tau217 level greater than 11.42 pg/mL in cerebrospinal fluid. A positive visual read of the flutemetamol PET scan for A\u03b2 was used to define the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in the primary care cohorts for the participants in whom lumbar puncture could not be performed.\n\nClinical Alzheimer disease was used as a secondary outcome and was defined according to criteria from the International Working Group, which include a typical presentation of the clinical syndrome of Alzheimer disease and confirmation with an Alzheimer disease biomarker (eMethods in Supplement 1). The analyses using clinical Alzheimer disease vs non-Alzheimer disease as an outcome were only performed in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia because a clinical diagnosis (for Alzheimer disease and other types of dementia) only can be established at these stages according to current clinical criteria. In addition, results from the flutemetamol PET scan (positivity was defined as a standardized uptake value ratio >1.033) were used as a secondary outcome in a subsample of primary and secondary care participants (eMethods in Supplement 1). Additional secondary outcomes were the cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio alone (\u22640.072 for positivity) and the cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b242 to p-tau181 ratio (<15 for positivity) (eMethods in Supplement 1).\n\nThe blood biomarker cutoff values were established in an independent cohort (eMethods in Supplement 1). The cutoff value was set at 90% specificity for Alzheimer disease pathology (the 1 cutoff-value approach). In addition, a 2 cutoff-value approach (using 1 upper and 1 lower cutoff value) was also established. This 2 cutoff-value approach is similar to the FDA-cleared approach for A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio in Lumipulse assays based on cerebrospinal fluid, and according to appropriate use recommendations for Alzheimer disease blood biomarkers. The 2 cutoff values corresponded to 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity in the independent cohort. Any results between these 2 cutoff values were termed intermediate. The selection of 1 cutoff value at 90% specificity and 2 cutoff values at 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity followed a previously published design. The rationale for this approach appears in other publications and in the eMethods in Supplement 1.\n\nThere were no missing blood biomarker values or missing data for the primary outcome. The binary variables were compared using \u03c7 tests and the continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. The receiver operating characteristic curves were used to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) values. Significant differences between the AUC values were tested using DeLong statistics.\n\nThe predefined cutoff values were used to calculate diagnostic accuracy (percentage of correctly classified cases of Alzheimer disease), positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for both the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone. In the 2 cutoff-value approach, the participants with an intermediate test result were not considered when calculating these measures. The 95% CIs were calculated using bootstrapping (n\u2009=\u20095000 resamples with replacement) and the differences in test metrics (eg, diagnostic accuracy) were calculated using the distribution of the bootstrapped differences.\n\nA 2-sided P value less than .05 indicated statistical significance. Version 4.3 of R programming language (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used for all statistical analyses.\n\nThere were 1213 patients (515 from primary care and 698 from secondary care) with cognitive symptoms who participated in the study (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). The mean age was 74.2 years (SD, 8.3 years) and 581 (48%) were women (Table and eTables 1-3 in Supplement 1). Compared with patients in the secondary care cohort, patients in the primary care cohort were older; had fewer years of education; had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes; and had a lower prevalence of dementia (Table). There was no difference in the prevalence of Alzheimer disease pathology (49.9% in the primary care cohort vs 49.7% in the secondary care cohort; standardized between-group difference, -0.4% [95% CI, -11.5% to 10.8%]). The box plots for APS2, the percentage of p-tau217, and the A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio in plasma (with Alzheimer disease pathology as a grouping variable) appear in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1.\n\nWhen the predefined single cutoff values were applied to the secondary care cohort (single-batch analysis; n\u2009=\u2009300), there was a diagnostic accuracy of 88% (95% CI, 84%-91%) with the APS2 compared with a diagnostic accuracy of 91% (95% CI, 87%-94%) with the percentage of p-tau217 alone.

The mean certainty of the assessment by dementia specialists was a score of 6 (95% CI, 5.8-6.2) on a scale from 0 (very low) to 10 (very high) for the level of diagnostic confidence.\n\nAfter the standard clinical evaluation (no biomarker data were used) in the primary care cohort (prospectively analyzed part), the primary care physicians had an overall diagnostic accuracy of 58% (95% CI, 51%-65%) when Alzheimer disease pathology was used as an outcome, which was significantly lower than the diagnostic accuracy of the prospectively measured APS2 (89% [95% CI, 85%-94%]) and the percentage of p-tau217 alone (90% [95% CI, 86%-94%]) (Figure 3B). The mean certainty of the assessment by primary care physicians was a score of 5.8 (95% CI, 5.5-6.1) on a scale from 0 (very low) to 10 (very high) for the level of diagnostic confidence. The results from the 2 cutoff-value approach appear in eFigure 3 in Supplement 1.\n\nWhen clinical Alzheimer disease (based on a consensus diagnosis including cerebrospinal fluid analysis or PET) was used as an outcome, and when the estimation of clinical Alzheimer disease was made by dementia specialists (no biomarker data were used), the diagnostic accuracy was 73% (95% CI, 68%-79%) in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia compared with 91% (95% CI, 88%-95%) for the APS2 and 91% (95% CI, 87%-94%) for the percentage of p-tau217 alone. For primary care physicians, the diagnostic accuracy was 61% (95% CI, 53%-69%) vs 91% (95% CI, 86%-96%) for the APS2 and was 91% (95% CI, 86%-95%) for the percentage of p-tau217 alone (eFigure 4 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1).\n\nTo evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the tests across levels of cognitive severity (subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia), the data were pooled from the secondary care cohort and the primary care cohort (Figure 4 and eFigure 5, eTables 5-6, and the eResults in Supplement 1 for comparisons between cognitive stages). When applying the 2 cutoff values, the diagnostic accuracy was significantly increased (as expected), and this was driven by the increased number of positive predictive values (eFigure 6 and eTable 7 in Supplement 1). Performance of the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone using clinically available cutoff values provided by C2N Diagnostics appear in eTable 8 in Supplement 1.\n\nThe results for the use of A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio compared with the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone are described in the eResults and appear in eTable 9 in Supplement 1. The AUC values for the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone (from the single-batch analysis and the prospective analyses) that were used in classifying Alzheimer disease pathology appear in Figure 5. The cerebrospinal fluid concentrations for the p-tau217 groups (negative, intermediate, or positive) appear in eFigure 7 in Supplement 1. The positive results for A\u03b2 PET appear in eFigure 8 in Supplement 1. Additional secondary outcomes appear in eTables 10-15 in Supplement 1 (clinical Alzheimer disease, A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid, and A\u03b242 to p-tau181 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid). Details of the results visualized in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 appear in eTables 16-20 in Supplement 1. The correlations between the Alzheimer disease biomarkers analyzed in plasma and in cerebrospinal fluid appear in eFigure 9 in Supplement 1.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that applying predefined blood biomarker cutoff values for the percentage of p-tau217 combined with A\u03b242:A\u03b240 ratio (the APS2) resulted in high diagnostic accuracy, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values for plasma samples collected from patients treated at primary and secondary care clinics and when using Alzheimer disease pathology as an outcome. Notably, the APS2 performed consistently in prospectively collected plasma samples analyzed biweekly, indicating the robustness of the assay performance.\n\nDespite clear differences in patient demographics and clinical characteristics between the primary care and secondary care cohorts (Table), the blood biomarkers exhibited comparable performance in both contexts (Figures 1 and 2). Moreover, the diagnostic accuracy of the blood test surpassed that of dementia specialists, and especially primary care physicians, after a standard clinical evaluation that did not include collection of biomarker data, highlighting the potential of these blood biomarkers for improving the diagnostic accuracy when assessing patients with possible Alzheimer disease (Figure 3 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Importantly, the blood test performed accurately despite a relatively high rate of medical comorbidities, including kidney disease (26% in the primary care cohort).\n\nThe key novel methods used in this study include (1) the application of predefined cutoff values derived from an independent cohort, (2) use of prospectively analyzed plasma samples, and (3) validation of the diagnostic performance of blood biomarker data collected from a diverse cohort of patients treated in primary care. It is challenging to accurately identify Alzheimer disease in primary care (especially in patients with mild cognitive symptoms). The use of the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy (89%-90% for the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone with Alzheimer disease pathology as an outcome) compared with the diagnostic accuracy among primary care physicians (58%) using current diagnostic tools (Figure 3).\n\nThe improved diagnostic accuracy of the APS2 and percentage of p-tau217 alone was also evident when using clinical Alzheimer disease as an outcome (91% for both the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone) in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia compared with a diagnostic accuracy of 61% for primary care physicians (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). The higher diagnostic accuracy of the blood test indicates that it could be suitable for implementation in primary care, but future studies need to examine its effect on clinical care. In addition to improving diagnostic accuracy, a positive test result could further support the initiation of widely available treatments (such as cholinesterase inhibitors). Even more importantly, it could aid in identifying potential candidates for timely antiamyloid treatment and who should be referred to secondary care.\n\nIn the secondary care cohort, dementia specialists correctly identified Alzheimer disease pathology in 71% of patients before reviewing cerebrospinal fluid test results (Figure 3), which is consistent with reports of a misdiagnosis rate between 25% and 30%. Use of blood biomarkers also had a higher rate of accuracy (91% for the blood test) than dementia specialists (73%) when using clinical Alzheimer disease as an outcome (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1), indicating the value of using the blood test at clinics in which Alzheimer disease biomarkers analyzed from cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture) and PET are not readily available. The diagnostic accuracy of the blood tests is on par with FDA-cleared cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and because blood tests are more time-effective, cost-effective, and convenient for the patient, they could also potentially replace cerebrospinal fluid tests and PET.\n\nFor a blood biomarker to be used as a confirmatory test to detect Alzheimer disease pathology, a very high positive predictive value is crucial, especially before the initiation of antiamyloid treatment. The 2 cutoff-value approach (also used for 1 of the 2 FDA-cleared cerebrospinal fluid tests), achieved positive predictive values of 97% to 99% in patients with cognitive impairment (Figure 4), which is the target population of currently available antiamyloid treatments. Although negative predictive values (87%-92% using the APS2) were slightly lower in patients with cognitive impairment (Figure 4 and eFigure 5 and eTables 5-6 in Supplement 1), we argue that a very high positive predictive value is probably more important in diagnosing patients as having Alzheimer disease, especially before initiating costly and burdensome antiamyloid treatment.\n\nImportantly, even in places with limited access to these new therapies, an accurate, biomarker-verified Alzheimer disease diagnosis can have a positive effect on clinical care and prognostication. The positive predictive values were suboptimal for accurate identification of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients at the subjective cognitive decline stage -- regardless of the cutoff value approach used (Figure 4), which could be a disadvantage for clinical trials including patients with presymptomatic Alzheimer disease, but not in clinical practice because there are no clinical criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer disease at the subjective cognitive decline stage. On the other hand, the negative predictive values were higher in patients with subjective cognitive decline (91%-94% for the APS2 or the percentage of p-tau217 alone, regardless of cutoff value approach used). This indicates that the blood test would be more useful for ruling out underlying Alzheimer disease when only subtle symptoms are present.\n\nEven though the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone showed similarly high diagnostic accuracy for identifying clinical Alzheimer disease (eTables 10-11 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1) as Alzheimer disease pathology (eTable 9 in Supplement 1), it is crucial to emphasize that a biomarker for Alzheimer disease pathology, however accurate, should not serve as a standalone diagnostic test for Alzheimer disease but must be interpreted in a clinical context. This is important because Alzheimer disease pathology can be asymptomatic for many years, and cognitive symptoms in some patients with Alzheimer disease pathology can be primarily caused by other conditions. Incorrect interpretation of a positive Alzheimer disease biomarker could thus lead to underdiagnosis of relatively common non-Alzheimer disease conditions (such as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy).\n\nBoth the APS2 and the percentage of p-tau217 alone showed robust test performance in the current analysis. The results were very similar between these biomarkers using Alzheimer disease pathology as an outcome in both the secondary care and primary care cohorts (eTable 9 in Supplement 1). In participants with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment, the APS2 demonstrated significantly higher diagnostic accuracy with the use of 2 cutoff values rather than only 1, although this approach resulted in a higher number of intermediate results compared with the percentage of p-tau217 alone (Figure 4 and eFigure 6 in Supplement 1). Participants with intermediate results are not as straightforward to manage in clinical practice. In secondary care, these patients may be candidates for further biomarker examination using cerebrospinal fluid tests or PET. Future research should explore the optimal workflow in primary care. Depending on the level of suspicion for Alzheimer disease and local or regional guidelines, these patients might be appropriate for referral to secondary care or for a repeat blood test in primary care.\n\nThere are some limitations to this study. First, the results proved robust across settings and plasma analysis designs, but validation in cohorts from other countries is essential, especially in cohorts that may have a lower prevalence of amyloid positivity and in primary care (where the performance of Alzheimer disease blood biomarkers is less known).\n\nSecond, future studies should also evaluate fully automated immunoassays that may be more practical for implementation at local clinical chemistry laboratories. Currently, mass spectrometry assays might have drawbacks (such as higher costs and requirement of high technical expertise).\n\nThird, we used the ratio of p-tau217 to non-p-tau217 (percentage of p-tau217) because the results from a prior study showed the percentage of p-tau217 can mitigate the effect of non-Alzheimer disease-related comorbid conditions (such as chronic kidney disease) on p-tau217. However, the current study did not further examine the potential advantage of percentage of p-tau217 vs p-tau217 or if there are specific settings or subgroups for which percentage of p-tau217 is especially useful. It would be of value to address the comparison of percentage of p-tau217 vs p-tau217 in future studies, especially because other assays only measure p-tau217 alone.\n\nThe APS2 and percentage of p-tau217 alone had high diagnostic accuracy for identifying Alzheimer disease among individuals with cognitive symptoms in primary and secondary care using predefined cutoff values. Future studies should evaluate how the use of blood tests for these biomarkers influences clinical care.\n\nCorresponding Authors: Sebastian Palmqvist, MD, PhD, and Oskar Hansson, MD, PhD, Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, St Johannesgatan 8, Malm\u00f6, Sweden SE-20502 (sebastian.palmqvist@med.lu.se and oskar.hansson@med.lu.se).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Dr Palmqvist had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\nCritical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content: Tideman, Mattsson-Carlgren, Schindler, Smith, Ossenkoppele, Calling, West, Monane, Verghese, Braunstein, Blennow, Janelidze, Stomrud, Salvad\u00f3.\n\nStatistical analysis: Palmqvist, Mattsson-Carlgren, West, Salvad\u00f3.\n\nObtained funding: Palmqvist, Mattsson-Carlgren, Ossenkoppele, Blennow, Salvad\u00f3, Hansson.\n\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Palmqvist, Schindler, Smith, Calling, Verghese, Braunstein, Hansson.\n\nSupervision: Palmqvist, West, Braunstein, Blennow, Hansson.\n\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: Dr Palmqvist reported receiving institutional research support from ki Elements, Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, and Avid Radiopharmaceuticals and receiving consultancy or speaker fees from Bioartic, Biogen, Esai, Eli Lilly, and Roche.

Its accuracy was compared with physician diagnoses based on standard evaluations that included clinical exams, cognitive tests, and a CT scan.\n\nThe findings, presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference by Sebastian Palmqvist, MD, PhD, of Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, were published simultaneously in JAMA.\n\n\"It's very difficult to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease without the support of accurate biomarkers,\" Palmqvist told MedPage Today. \"About 25% to 30% of patients with cognitive impairment at specialist clinics are misdiagnosed when biomarkers are not used, and the frequency of misdiagnosis in primary care is likely even higher,\" he said.\n\n\"We think this blood test can substantially improve the diagnostic work-up of Alzheimer's disease in specialist clinics without good access to CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] or PET tests for Alzheimer's disease,\" Palmqvist continued. \"In clinics with access to CSF or PET, the blood test can likely replace those diagnostic methods in many patients.\"\n\nBlood tests -- once they're confirmed to be more than 90% accurate and become more widely available -- can possibly redefine the diagnostic work-up for Alzheimer's, noted Maria Carrillo, PhD, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association.\n\n\"While, at this time, doctors in primary and secondary care should use a combination of cognitive and blood or other biomarker testing to diagnose Alzheimer's, blood tests have the potential to increase the accuracy of early diagnoses and maximize the opportunity to access Alzheimer's treatments as early as possible for better outcomes,\" Carillo said.\n\nThe tests should be used only on patients with cognitive symptoms, the Alzheimer's Association maintained. Testing cognitively unimpaired individuals outside of research studies is not recommended according to the 2024 criteria for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. In 2022, the Alzheimer's Association also published appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers.\n\n\"We personally recommend testing only patients with cognitive impairment and not the 'worried well,'\" Palmqvist said. \"Education of clinicians who will use the tests is needed, so they test the correct patients, and they know how to interpret the results.\"\n\nThe study assessed 1,213 patients in the Swedish BioFINDER and BioFINDER2 studies who had clinical evaluations due to cognitive symptoms from February 2020 through January 2024. Mean age was about 74 and 48% were women; 23% had subjective cognitive decline, 44% had mild cognitive impairment, and 33% had dementia. In both the primary care and secondary care assessments, 50% of patients had Alzheimer's pathology.\n\nOne plasma sample from each patient was analyzed as part of a single batch for each cohort. The blood test also was evaluated prospectively in each cohort, with one plasma sample per patient sent for analysis within 2 weeks of collection.\n\nThe primary outcome was Alzheimer's pathology determined by abnormal CSF amyloid ratios and p-tau217, evaluated by calculating predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), diagnostic accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) values.\n\nWhen plasma samples were analyzed in a single batch in the primary care cohort, the APS2 had an AUC of 0.97, PPV of 91%, and NPV of 92%. In the secondary care cohort, AUC was 0.96, PPV was 88%, and NPV was 87%.\n\nWhen plasma samples were analyzed prospectively, the APS2 showed an AUC in the primary care cohort of 0.96, PPV of 88%, and NPV of 90%. In the secondary care cohort, AUC was 0.97, PPV was 91%, and NPV was 91%.\n\nThe APS2 showed high accuracy using pre-defined cutoff values, ranging from 88% to 92% across all four cohorts. In the overall population, the diagnostic accuracy of APS2 (90%, 95% CI 88%-92%) was the same as the diagnostic accuracy using the percentage of p-tau217 alone (90%, 95% CI 88%-91%).\n\nThe test in this study was performed at a single U.S. lab, noted Stephen Salloway, MD, MS, of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and colleagues, in a JAMA editorial accompanying the research paper.\n\n\"There are many other high-performing immunoassays for the amyloid and tau proteins that are in development and may become more widely available,\" they pointed out.\n\nA key limitation of the Swedish study was its lack of racial and ethnic diversity, making it tough to generalize findings to other populations, Salloway and co-authors observed. In the U.S., Alzheimer's blood tests will need FDA approval and CMS coverage to become widely adopted, they added.\n\n\"Overall, this study marks a milestone in blood biomarker development, as a blood test for Alzheimer's disease moves from the research world to dementia specialists and now into the hands of primary care physicians,\" wrote Gil Rabinovici, MD, and Lawren VandeVrede, MD, PhD, both of the University of California San Francisco, in a JAMA Neurology editorial.\n\n\"It is truly humbling to reflect on the fact that verification of Alzheimer's disease pathology, once purely the purview of the neuropathologist, can now be accomplished in the primary care clinic.\"", "source": {"uri": "medpagetoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MedPage Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

An Amyloid Probability Score-2 (APS2) was compiled, based upon combining %p-tau217 -- a ratio of plasma phosphorylated-tau217 and non-phosphorylated-tau217 -- as well as the ratio of both amyloid-beta 42/40. combining these values was calculated. Plasma samples were submitted for biweekly analysis, with the main study outcome being amyloid status as determined by positive cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers indicative of AD.\n\nIn memory clinics, APS2 was approximately 90% accurate at identifying AD, with specialists operating at a 73% success rate. Similarly, in a primary care setting, APS2 also logged an approximate 90% accuracy rate with physicians registering 63% accuracy, Palmqvist and colleagues wrote.\n\nThe researchers additionally recorded a 51% AD pathology positivity rate in a primary care setting, within which 47% were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 28% with dementia and 25% with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).\n\nData also showed a 49% accuracy rate in secondary care settings for AD pathology positivity, within which 43% were diagnosed with MCI, 36% had dementia and 21% had signs consistent with SCD.\n\n\"These were the results of blood samples that have been shipped biweekly for analysis from primary care units, which is similar to routine clinical practice,\" Palmqvist said in a related release. \"These results were especially impressive considering that older populations in primary care often have medical conditions that can influence or vary the concentrations of p-tau217.\"", "source": {"uri": "healio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blood plasma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lund University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schizophrenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mild cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subjectivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence_Based_Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Evidence Based Medicine", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Pelvic_Exams_and_Pap_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Pelvic Exams and Pap Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.healio.com/~/media/temporary/bloodtestinlab.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770939", "eventUri": "eng-9770939", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

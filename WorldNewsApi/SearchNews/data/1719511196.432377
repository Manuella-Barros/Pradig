{"id": 223751492, "title": "\u2018Furiosa,\u2019 \u2018Garfield\u2019 lead slowest Memorial Day box office in decades", "text": "Movie theaters are looking more and more like a wasteland this summer. Neither \u201c Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga \u201d nor \u201c The Garfield Movie \u201d could save Memorial Day weekend, which is cruising towards a two-decade low. \u201c Furiosa,\u201d the Mad Max prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed the first place spot for the Friday-Saturday-Sunday weekend with $25.6 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Warner Bros. is waiting until Monday to release its four-day estimates. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d animated and family-friendly, was the other big new offering this weekend from Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures and Alcon Entertainment. It is claiming No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with an estimated $31.9 million in ticket sales through Memorial Day. Sony estimates its three-day earnings to be $24.8 million. Aside from Memorial Day in 2020 when theaters were closed due to COVID-19, these are the lowest earning No. 1 movies in 29 years, since \u201cCasper\u201d earned $22.5 million (not adjusted for inflation) in its first four days in 1995. Big earners are more typical for the holiday weekend, which has had ten movies crack $100 million, led by \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u2019s\u201d record-setting $160 million launch in 2022. Last year, the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d joined the group with a $118 million debut. Audiences even turned out in greater numbers over the pandemic-addled weekend in 2021 for \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d which made over $57 million. \u201cFuriosa\u201d was never expected to join the $100 million opener club, which Warner Bros. released on 3,804 screens in the U.S. and Canada. But it was supposed to have a slightly stronger showing in the $40 million range over its first four days. That would have been more in line with its predecessor, \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d which opened to $45.4 million in May 2015. \u201cFury Road,\u201d starring Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, went on to gross nearly $380 million worldwide. This new origin story in which Taylor-Joy plays a younger version of Theron\u2019s character had a lot of things going for it, too, including strong reviews out of the just-wrapped Cannes Film Festival (it has an 89% on Rotten Tomatoes) and a splashy international press tour with many buzzy premiere looks from Taylor-Joy. With a reported $168 million production budget, not accounting for marketing and promotion, \u201cFuriosa\u201d has a long road to profitability. \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d meanwhile, was more modestly budgeted, at a reported $60 million. Chris Pratt voices the lasagna-loving, Monday-hating orange cat in the movie that got scathing reviews from critics (it has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes). Audiences meanwhile gave both \u201cFuriosa\u201d and \u201cThe Garfield Movie\u201d a B+ CinemaScore and 4.5 stars out of 5 on PostTrak. In its second weekend, John Krasinski\u2019s \u201cIF\u201d fell 53%, adding $16 million through Sunday and $20.7 million through Monday, bringing its domestic total to $63.3 million. Worldwide, it has surpassed $100 million. \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d now in its third weekend, added $13.4 million through Sunday, bringing its global total to $294.8 million, making it the fourth-highest grossing film of the year. Earlier this week, the industry trade The Hollywood Reporter asked \u201c what happened to the $100 million opener? \u201d Notably, 2023 has had none yet. The biggest of the year was \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d which opened to $82.5 million and went on to earn over $711 million worldwide. The lack of a recent runaway hit just puts more pressure on the upcoming films to make up the slack. Still on the way are a slew of potential blockbusters like Paramount\u2019s \u201cA Quiet Place: Day One\u201d (June 27), Universal\u2019s \u201cDespicable Me 4\u201d (July 3) and \u201c Twisters \u201d (July 19) and two heavy-hitters from Disney: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d (June 14) and \u201c Deadpool & Wolverine \u201d (July 26).", "summary": "The box office is cruising for a two-decade low", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-sony-garfield-a-quiet-place-part-ii-anya-taylorjoy-b2551819.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/17/Film_Review-Furiosa_50745.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:57:12", "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "authors": ["Lindsey Bahr"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.257}

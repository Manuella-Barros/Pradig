However, real estate mogul Grant Cardone argues that this notion no longer holds true. In fact, for young Americans, Cardone believes that the idea of home ownership simply shouldn\u2019t cross their minds right now. Don't miss Commercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in.

Here's how \u201cAnyone under 30 years old should not even consider buying a home at this time,\u201d he wrote in a recent post on X. Cardone, who once called buying a home \u201cthe worst investment people can make,\u201d went on to highlight the heavy financial burden of homeownership. He wrote that the average home now costs $436,000. He didn\u2019t cite a source for this figure, but the median sale price of houses in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024 was $420,800, per the U.S. Census Bureau. \u201cThe total annual outlay is $50,000 a year ($4200/mo),\u201d he wrote, explaining that this amount includes interest payments, property taxes, HOA (homeowners association) fees, PMI (private mortgage insurance) and maintenance costs. As a result, Cardone recommends that young people consider renting instead. \u201cYou can rent for under $2,000 with no long term commitment, down payment & keep your mobility,\u201d he wrote, concluding that \u201cBuying a house is no longer the \u2018American dream.\u2019\u201d Many still find real estate to be an appealing asset class due to its income potential and it being a hedge against inflation and a way to diversify a portfolio. It\u2019s also a favorite investment asset of Cardone\u2019s, who authored a book titled \u201cHow To Create Wealth Investing In Real Estate.\u201d And while the cost of homeownership can be substantial, there are now strategies to invest in real estate without purchasing a house for yourself. Here\u2019s a look at three of them. Invest in publicly-traded REITs Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are companies that own income-producing real estate like apartment buildings, shopping centers and office towers. You can think of a REIT as a giant landlord: it owns a large number of properties, collects rent from the tenants and passes at least 90% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividend payments. It\u2019s easy to invest in REITs because many are publicly traded. Unlike buying a house \u2014 where transactions can take weeks and even months to close \u2014 you can buy or sell shares in a REIT any time you want throughout the trading day. That makes REITs one of the most liquid real estate investment options available. Also, there\u2019s no limit as to how much \u2014 or how little \u2014 your investment can be. While buying a house usually requires a hefty down payment, you can buy shares in a REIT with as much money as you are willing to spend.

Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds Invest on a crowdfunding platform Crowdfunding has become a buzzword in recent years. It refers to the practice of funding a project by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. These days, many crowdfunding investing platforms allow you to own a percentage of physical real estate \u2014 from rental properties and commercial buildings to parcels of land. Sponsors of crowdfunded real estate deals and the platforms usually charge fees to investors. Some crowdfunding platforms are targeted for accredited investors, sometimes with minimum investments that can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. To be an accredited investor, you need to have a net worth of over $1 million or an earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the past two years. If you\u2019re not an accredited investor, some platforms let you invest small sums if you like \u2014 even $100. Such platforms make real estate investing more accessible to the general public by simplifying the process and lowering the barriers to entry. However, retail investors should educate themselves about the drawbacks, like liquidity constraints and no guaranteed income, before investing any money. Invest in ETFs Picking the right REIT or crowdfunded deal requires plenty of due diligence on your part. If you\u2019re looking for an easier, more diversified way to invest in real estate, consider exchange-traded funds. You can think of an ETF as a portfolio of stocks. And as the name suggests, ETFs trade on major exchanges, making them convenient to buy and sell. Investors use ETFs to gain access to a diversified portfolio. You don\u2019t need to worry about which stocks to buy and sell. Some ETFs passively track an index, while others are actively managed. They all charge a fee \u2014 referred to as the management expense ratio \u2014 in exchange for managing the fund. There are many ETFs that focus on real estate. Options such as the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) and the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE) could provide a starting point for further research.

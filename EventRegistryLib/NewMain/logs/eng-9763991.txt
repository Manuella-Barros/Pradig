The decision is a win for the ride-hailing industry and a setback for unions pushing for employee status for gig workers. The ruling preserves drivers' contractor status while granting some benefits.\n\nCalifornia's top state court on Thursday upheld a measure approved by voters allowing app-based services such as Uber and Lyft to consider drivers in the most populous U.S. state as independent contractors rather than as employees entitled to greater benefits. The ruling by the California Supreme Court is a major victory for the ride-hailing industry, which has said that many companies would end or limit service in the state if they were forced to treat thousands of drivers as their employees.\n\nThe court dismissed a lawsuit by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and four drivers who say the 2020 ballot measure known as Proposition 22, which preserves drivers' contractor status while granting them some benefits, was unconstitutional. Uber in a statement said that the ruling upheld \"the will of the nearly 10 million Californians who voted to deliver historic benefits and protections to drivers, while protecting their independence.\"\n\nSEIU California Executive Director Tia Orr said the union was disappointed by the ruling, but that rideshare drivers could continue to fight for their rights by seeking to unionize. \"Gig workers are determined to ensure fairness in the gig economy and won't stop fighting to win greater workplace rights and protections on the job,\" she said.\n\nWhether gig workers should be treated as employees or contractors is a crucial issue for the ride-service industry. Employees are entitled to minimum wage, overtime pay, reimbursements for expenses and other protections that do not extend to independent contractors, who can cost companies up to 30% less, according to several studies. Uber, Lyft and other app-based services spent more than $200 million on a campaign to pass Prop 22, which they say allows drivers to continue earning money while enjoying the flexibility of part-time gig work.\n\nPassed in November 2020 by nearly 60% of voters in California, Prop 22 allows app-based transportation services to classify drivers as independent contractors if they are paid at least 120% of the minimum wage while passengers are in the car and receive expense reimbursements and subsidies to pay for health insurance. A state appeals court last year rejected SEIU's argument that Prop 22 improperly limited the legislature's exclusive power to regulate the state's workers' compensation system by barring app-based drivers from receiving those benefits, which are only granted to employees. The California Supreme Court on Thursday agreed.\n\nCalifornia is just one front in a nationwide legal battle over the classification of gig drivers and other contract workers. Minnesota lawmakers passed a measure in May that would set a minimum wage of $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute for gig drivers, replacing a higher minimum adopted by Minneapolis that spurred Uber and Lyft to threaten to cease operating in the city.\n\nIn June, Uber and Lyft agreed to adopt a $32.50 hourly minimum wage for drivers in Massachusetts and pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit by the state claiming they improperly treated drivers as independent contractors. A proposal that would allow app-based drivers to unionize will go before voters in the state in November.

A proposal that would allow app-based drivers to unionize will go before voters in the state in November.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridesharing_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridesharing company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Freelancer-Contractor_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Freelancer-Contractor Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-editorial-10750547p-20240725222920245.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2114, "textEnd": 2127}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

State of California that Proposition 22, which was approved by 58% of California voters in 2020, complies with the state constitution. Prop 22 -- which was overturned in 2021 by an Alameda County Superior Court judge in 2021 -- was upheld in March 2023 by the state's 1st District Court of Appeals.\n\nThe business models of app-based companies including DoorDash, Instacart, Lyft, and Uber rely upon minimizing frontline worker compensation by categorizing drivers as independent contractors instead of employees. Independent contractors are not entitled to unemployment insurance, health insurance, or compensation for business expenses.\n\nThere are approximately 1.4 million app-based gig workers in California, according to industry estimates.\n\nWhile DoorDash hailed Thursday's ruling as \"not only a victory for Dashers, but also for democracy itself,\" gig worker advocates condemned the decision.\n\n\"Over the last three years, gig workers across California have experienced firsthand that Prop 22 is nothing more than a bait-and-switch meant to enrich global corporations at the expense of the Black, brown, and immigrant workers who power their earnings,\" plaintiff Hector Castellanos, who drives for Uber and Lyft, said in a statement.\n\n\"Prop 22 has allowed gig companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to deprive us of a living wage, access to workers compensation, paid sick leave, and meaningful healthcare coverage,\" Castellanos added. \"Today's ruling only strengthens our demand for the right to join together in a union so that we can begin improving the gig economy for workers and our customers.\"\n\nLorena Gonzalez, president of the California Federation of Labor Unions, AFL-CIO, said that \"we are deeply disappointed that the state Supreme Court has allowed tech corporations to buy their way out of basic labor laws despite Proposition 22's inconsistencies with our state constitution.\"\n\n\"These companies have upended our social contract, forcing workers and the public to take on the inherent risk created by this work, while they profit,\" she continued. \"A.B. 5 granted virtually all California workers the right to be paid for all hours worked, health and safety standards, unemployment insurance, workers compensation, and the right to organize.\"\n\n\"Rideshare and delivery drivers deserve those rights as well,\" Gonzalez stressed.\n\nThe Gig Workers Rising campaign said on social media that \"Uber and other app corporations spent $220 million to buy this law, and they did it by tricking Californians.\"\n\nProp 22's passage in November 2020 with nearly 59% of the vote was the culmination of what was by far the most expensive ballot measure in California history. App-based companies and their backers outspent labor and progressive groups by more than 10 to 1, with proponents pouring a staggering $204.5 million into the \"yes\" campaign's coffers against just $19 million for the \"no\" side.\n\n\"Voters were told the initiative would provide us with 'historic new benefits' and guaranteed earnings,\" said Gig Workers Rising. \"But since it went into effect, drivers have seen our pay go down, learned the benefits are a sham, and have to accept unsafe rides because of the constant threat of being 'deactivated,' kicked off the app with little explanation or warning.\"\n\n\"If Uber really cared about good benefits and fair wages, it could make that happen tomorrow,\" the campaign added. \"Instead, it has shown it would rather slash pay, bamboozle voters, and put drivers' lives and livelihoods in danger -- all while promising $7 billion in stock buybacks to banks and billionaires.\"\n\nVeena Dubal, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine who focuses on labor and inequality, toldCalMatters that Thursday's ruling was \"a really tragic outcome,\" but \"it's not the end of the road.\"\n\nDubal's sentiment was echoed by some California state legislators, who said the ruling presents an opportunity to act.\n\n\"While this decision is frustrating, it must also be motivating,\" said state Senate Labor Committee Chair Lola Smallwood-Cuevas (D-28). \"I'm more determined than ever to ensure that all workers -- including our diverse and Black, Indigenous, and people of color-led gig workforce -- have the basic protections of workers compensation, paid sick leave, family leave, disability insurance, and the right to form a union.\"\n\nProp 22 has served as a template for lawmakers in other states seeking to deny or limit basic worker rights, benefits, and protections.\n\nIn Massachusetts, app-based companies have been fighting for years to get a measure to classify drivers as contractors on the state ballot. In 2022, Lyft made the largest political donation in state history -- $14.4 million -- to a coalition funding one such proposal.\n\nLast month, Uber and Lyft reached an agreement with the office of Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell, a Democrat, to pay $175 million to settle a lawsuit filed in 2020. As part of the deal, the companies also agreed to increase driver pay and provide paid sick leave, accident insurance, and some health benefits. The agreement does not address how app-based gig workers should be classified.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitution_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State constitution (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Living wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_Gonzalez_(California_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lorena Gonzalez (California politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sick leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Irvine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Irvine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/prop-22-protest.jpg?id=52974337&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C222%2C0%2C223", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 3066, "textEnd": 3079}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The decision, upholding a state ballot measure called Proposition 22, was considered a major victory for the gig-economy companies.\n\nThe question of whether those who drive for the companies should be treated as employees or contractors has spurred a yearslong legal battle in the state. In 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, allowing app-based companies to continue to treat their workers as independent contractors. That vote reversed an earlier court ruling that found such companies controlled too many of their drivers' working conditions to treat them as contractors. The ballot measure campaign cost its advocates, including Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Instacart, and DoorDash, some $200 million, breaking state records for spending.\n\nDriver advocates have long argued that those behind the wheel were due the same sort of benefits offered to full-time employees, including health care, sick pay, and workers' compensation. The companies have said that gig work is an entirely new and flexible form of work, and that treating drivers as employees would reshape their businesses. One 2020 analysis suggested that treating drivers as employees in California would cost Uber and Lyft nearly $800 million annually in just payroll taxes and benefits.\n\nThe 2020 ballot measure required the app-based companies to institute a wage floor, at least for the time drivers spend with passengers in the car, and to pay out health care stipends for workers who drive enough monthly hours.\n\n\"Today's decision was supposed to bring justice, to confirm that even as workers who are managed by apps on our phone, by algorithms, by AI, that we are indeed workers with robot managers,\" Nicole Moore, president of Rideshare Drivers United and a part-time driver in Los Angeles, said during a briefing with reporters following the decision. \"And we deserve the same rights and benefits as all other workers in our state. But that did not happen today.\" Moore called on lawmakers in the state to find a \"creative pathway\" to ensure that drivers are protected and paid fairly.\n\nIn a statement, Uber said the ruling put \"an end to misguided attempts to force [drivers] into an employment model that they overwhelmingly do not want.\" Lyft also praised the decision: \"We are pleased to continue to bring Californians closer to their friends, family, and neighbors, and provide drivers with access to flexible earnings opportunities and benefits while preserving their independence.\"\n\nOn a call for reporters hosted by proponents of Proposition 22, some drivers said they were glad that app-based companies would maintain their flexibility. \"I'm just so grateful right now,\" said driver Stephanie Whitfield, who works in the Coachella Valley.\n\nThe ruling won't have a direct effect on other states' gig worker laws, but could influence policy in other places. Minnesota and Colorado both recently passed laws instituting better pay standards for app-based drivers, though neither resolved whether workers should be treated as contractors or employees. The Biden administration has taken aim at worker misclassification in the gig economy through new labor rules, though app-based companies say those rules don't affect their businesses.", "source": {"uri": "qnewshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "QNewsHub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "soumyadeep_pal@qnewshub.com", "name": "Soumyadeep Pal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmates", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Postmates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payroll_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Payroll tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i3.wp.com/media.wired.com/photos/66a2995c8e6aaedac7e97839/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/%20Classifying%20Uber%20and%20Lyft%20Drivers%20as%20Independent%20Contractors_h_27.RTSZJP5S.jpg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

It was overturned in 2021 by a California Superior Court judge, only to be upheld by three appeals court judges last year. The ruling means that Uber and Lyft can continue to operate in the state as usual, and the hundreds of thousands of drivers who work for both services will continue to be classified as independent contractors.\n\nOpponents of Proposition 22 argued that it was unconstitutional because it would limit the state legislature's ability to oversee workers' compensation. Gig companies spent $200 million supporting the measure, which maintained the contractor classification for drivers while conceding some benefits like health care stipends and accident insurance.\n\nHector Castellanos, a gig worker and a plaintiff in the case, condemned the court's decision. In a statement, he called Proposition 22 a \"bait and switch\" that comes \"at the expense of the Black, brown and immigrant workers.\"\n\nUber, Lyft and the delivery service DoorDash all cheered the decision, saying that the measure maintains flexibility for gig workers and guarantees them some benefits.\n\n\"Whether drivers or couriers choose to earn just a few hours a week or more, their freedom to work when and how they want is now firmly etched into California law,\" Noah Edwardsen, an Uber spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nWhile the ruling was an expected defeat for labor activists, the judges left open potential challenges to Proposition 22, said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California, Irvine School of Law.\n\nThe ongoing fight for increased pay and benefits for gig workers is \"a political and moral issue, more than a legal one,\" Ms. Dubal said. She added that while places like the European Union have worked to create a presumption of employment for gig workers that extend them additional rights, \"California has gone the opposite direction.\"\n\nIf the proposition had not been upheld, Uber and Lyft could have been sued for misclassifying their drivers. The solution would most likely have been some kind of fleet system in which full-time employees operated Ubers and Lyfts, but it's unclear exactly what that would have looked like.\n\nThe decision comes amid a national push by labor groups and gig workers for higher wages and increased benefits.

This upholds a California appeals court decision in March 2023 to overturn Roesch's ruling.\n\nProposition 22 was Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart's answer to Assembly Bill 5, a state law that would have required the companies to classify those workers as employees, entitling them to a minimum wage, workers' compensation and other benefits.\n\nCollectively, the companies spent over $200 million in advertising to convince drivers and California voters that Prop 22 was in their best interest.\n\nThose app-based companies built entire business models on the assumption that they wouldn't have to pay for health insurance, sick leave and other services provided to full-time employees. Their asset-light models, which rely on gig workers using their own vehicles to take passengers on rides and deliver food, are at the core of each company's goal to keep capital expenditures low and to scale far and wide.\n\nProp 22 sought to find a middle ground of sorts between providing workers employment and keeping them as unsupported contractors. Per Prop 22, workers are eligible to earn 120% of state minimum wage for hours worked plus 30 cents per engaged mile, adjusted for inflation after 2021. (Uber, Lyft and DoorDash actually failed to adjust for inflation, and last year ended up having to reimburse gig workers millions for unpaid vehicle expenses.)\n\nHowever, that so-called minimum wage only applies when a worker is actively engaged in a gig, and doesn't reimburse drivers for time spent waiting for one. The companies rely on workers to be hanging out and ready to accept a gig so that they can maintain their reputation of offering on-demand service.\n\nCritics have argued that the earnings guarantees fall short of actually giving drivers minimum wage after factoring in work-related expenses like car maintenance, gas and insurance.\n\nProp 22 also offers healthcare subsidies to drivers who work a certain number of hours per week, but drivers have told TechCrunch that it's difficult to qualify for those subsidies. Drivers have to work 15 active hours per week for half the stipend and 25 active hours per week for the full stipend, according to Sergio Avedian, a contributor for The Rideshare Guy.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_bellan@techcrunch.com", "name": "Rebecca Bellan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instacart", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instacart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Assembly_Bill_5_(2019)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Assembly Bill 5 (2019)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2159379442.jpg?resize=1200,800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 100, "textEnd": 113}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig companies had argued their business models depended on the law being upheld and threatened to shut down in California if it was struck down.\n\nThe decision has sweeping implications for the million-plus people who drive for various app-based companies in California. Some of these workers have raised concerns over low wages, minimal workplace protections and exploitative practices they say they face. The decision also is likely to have ripple effects on drivers across the U.S., as Uber has pushed for laws similar to Proposition 22 in other states .\n\nThe decision Thursday falls in line with comments made by justices in May when they heard oral arguments on the constitutionality of the law. Their line of questioning suggested they were not persuaded by the argument that Proposition 22 should be overturned because it interferes with the state Legislature's authority to provide workers' compensation protections to drivers.\n\nUber, Lyft, DoorDash and other companies poured upward of $200 million into a campaign to sway voters in favor of Proposition 22 in 2020. It passed with 59% of the vote and went into effect soon after.\n\nUnder the law, drivers are considered to be their own employers, a designation that frees the companies they drive for from having to provide the full slate benefits that traditional employees in the state are entitled to, such as overtime, sick leave and a minimum wage.\n\nThe Service Employees International Union and a group of drivers first brought the lawsuit challenging Proposition 22 in January 2021, just after the law went into effect. They unsuccessfully sought to take the case directly to the California Supreme Court and were left to pursue the case in a lower court.\n\nThen, in a sweeping decision in August 2021, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch ruled that Proposition 22 was unconstitutional and unenforceable. The law failed to pass constitutional muster, Roesch wrote, because it infringed on the power of the Legislature, explicitly granted by the state Constitution, to regulate compensation for workers' injuries.\n\n\"If the people wish to use their initiative power to restrict or qualify a 'plenary' and 'unlimited' power granted to the Legislature, they must first do so by initiative constitutional amendment, not by initiative statute,\" the judge wrote.\n\nIn March 2023, a split three-judge panel from a state appeals court largely reversed that ruling, finding the law did not impede the Legislature's authority and upholding the legality of the law's provision classifying drivers as contractors. Supporters of the law celebrated that ruling as a \"historic victory for the nearly 1.4 million drivers who rely on the independence and flexibility of app-based work to earn income, and for the integrity of California's initiative system.\"", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/299/29936/2993612.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The companies could have offset about 85 per cent of those additional costs in part via higher fees, they said, though that could have reduced demand.\n\nThe supreme court's decision marks the final stage of a years-long challenge in the California courts by individual drivers and the Service Employees International Union that sought to overturn Prop 22.\n\nUber and Lyft in June agreed to pay a combined $175mn to settle a long- running Massachusetts state lawsuit over whether drivers should be classified as employees or independent contractors.

By ruling it constitutional, the state Supreme Court allows Uber, Lyft and other gig companies to continue skirting some of the labor protections and benefits available to most employees in the state. The case has broad impacts; more than 1.4 million Californians do gig work for Uber, Instacart or similar companies, CalMatters reported on Thursday.\n\nThe battle over how gig workers are classified in California picked up in 2019, when the state Legislature passed a law requiring many companies that use independent contractors to reclassify them as employees. At the time, state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo blasted the gig companies to the New York Times and said, \"Today we are determining the future of the California economy.\"\n\nUber and Lyft quickly swung into action, piling tens of millions of dollars into a campaign for Prop. 22. Voters passed the initiative the next year, carving out the app companies from the legislature's law. Prop. 22 erected a new system of benefits for drivers, but protests immediately mounted across the state. Drivers complain that the law leaves them without crucial protections like sick pay and unemployment insurance; the law also lets Uber and Lyft avoid paying drivers for the time they spend waiting for new rides.\n\nA legal battle wound its way through the courts, with an Alameda judge calling Prop. 22 unconstitutional in 2021. But by the time it reached the state's highest court, the plaintiff's side, led by Bay Area driver Hector Castellanos, appeared doomed -- the justices grilled Castellanos' lawyer in a May hearing. The driver's side argued that because Prop. 22's law changes workers' compensation arrangements, it breaks a rule in the California Constitution giving the Legislature power over workers' compensation.\n\nThough the justices didn't buy that argument, in a spark of hope for Castellanos' side, Justice Goodwin Liu wrote in the opinion that the Legislature might be able to try to change the law. But that's a question for another time.\n\nNicole Moore, president of the advocacy group Rideshare Drivers United, brought up that punt in a video stream with members and press on Thursday afternoon, pointing out that the court's ruling wasn't about the fairness of driver pay or working conditions. She called the ruling a \"very hard moment\" but added that she hopes suffering, ill-paid drivers can still see improvement.\n\n\"We call on all the people who support drivers -- the lawmakers, the judges, the attorney generals -- and say, help us figure out how to get out from under this,\" Moore said.\n\nShe said her organization is \"fearful for all other workers\" who might see their labor controlled by apps in the future.\n\nRamona Prieto, Uber's head of public policy and communications for the Western United States, said in a Thursday statement to SFGATE that the company stands ready to make sure that \"progress continues\" with finding ways to preserve drivers' independence while giving them benefits.\n\n\"Whether drivers or couriers choose to earn just a few hours a week or more, their freedom to work when and how they want is now firmly etched into California law, putting an end to misguided attempts to force them into an employment model that they overwhelmingly do not want,\" Prieto wrote.\n\nDoorDash's vice president of communications and policy, Liz Jarvis-Shean, called the court's decision a \"huge victory for California Dashers and voters.\"\n\n\"We are pleased that this law is affirmed and this unnecessary legal process is behind us,\" she wrote in a statement sent to SFGATE.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Francisco

Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig-economy companies invested around $200 million in the passage of Proposition 22, which voters approved in 2020. The state's highest court rejected a legal challenge from a drivers' group and a labor union, ending their quest to bring full employee benefits to the state's gig workers.\n\nThe California Supreme Court ruling affirms the state's definition of drivers and other gig workers as independent contractors. Proposition 22, which received the support of 59 percent of voters in 2020, gives gig workers limited benefits like a baseline income and health insurance for those working at least 15 hours a week. However, it also allows the companies to avoid providing the broad swath of benefits full employees receive.\n\nThe Service Employees International Union and a drivers' group sued to challenge the law after it went into effect in early 2021. Their lawsuit got an early boost from lower courts: An Alameda County Superior Court Justice ruled that year that Proposition 22 was \"unconstitutional and unenforceable,\" as the LA Times reported. The lower-court judge determined that the law diminished the state Legislature's power to regulate injury compensation for workers.\n\nHowever, in 2023, a state appeals court ruled the opposite, that Proposition 22 didn't impede on the Legislature's authority. Thursday's decision upholds that ruling, ending the long saga and leaving the state's gig workers with fewer benefits than they'd otherwise have. Proposition 22 remained in effect during the legal challenges, so nothing will change in how they're treated.\n\nUber, Lyft, DoorDash and other gig-economy companies fought tooth and nail to pass and uphold the law. Four years ago, they invested upwards of $200 million in campaigning for it. They even threatened to pull their businesses from the state if they were forced to classify drivers as employees.\n\nThe LA Times reports the decision could influence other states' laws. Uber has lobbied for similar legislation in other parts of the US. A law in Washington state closely parallels it, and the companies recently settled with the Massachusetts attorney general to provide similar (minimal) benefits to gig workers in that state.\n\nUber framed the ruling as a victory for upholding the will of the people (well, apart from the gig workers who wanted more benefits and protections). The company described the Supreme Court's decision as \"affirming the will of the nearly 10 million Californians who voted to deliver historic benefits and protections to drivers, while protecting their independence.\"", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alameda County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2mkQBmFC5InaGw_A5iMJBQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/c042ad70-4ac6-11ef-bdb5-6b9dd83cc7e3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The ballot measure allows companies such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash (DASH) to classify their employees as independent contractors. A group of ride-share drivers and labor unions challenged the constitutionality of Proposition 22 in 2021. The legal fight culminated in Thursday's state Supreme Court ruling.\n\nOn the stock market today, Uber stock edged higher fractionally to 66.53. DoorDash traded flat, last up a fraction at 102.55, while Lyft stock slipped a fraction to 12.33.\n\nWhy Prop 22 Matters To Uber, Lyft And DoorDash\n\nLawmakers across the globe are grappling with whether drivers and couriers working on app-based services such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash should be considered employees. California is a major battleground for that debate. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash are all headquartered in the state.\n\nProposition 22 was Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart's response to Assembly Bill 5. Often called AB 5, the 2019 state law extended employee status to many types of contract work, entitling workers to a minimum wage and workers' compensation, among other benefits.\n\nViewing that as a major threat to the so-called gig-model the companies rely on, tech firms pushed for a ballot measure that exempted their businesses. Under Prop 22, companies can classify drivers as independent contractors, as long as they are paid at least 120% of the state minimum wage while engaged in a gig job. They also must be able to receive reimbursements for expenses, among other provisions.\n\nTech companies led by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash spent a combined $200 million on the campaign for Prop. 22 before voters approved it.\n\nUber And Union Leaders Respond\n\nIn a statement published to the company's website Thursday, Uber called the decision represented a win for drivers.\n\n\"Whether drivers or couriers choose to earn just a few hours a week or more, their freedom to work when and how they want is now firmly etched into California law, putting an end to misguided attempts to force them into an employment model that they overwhelmingly do not want,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnion leaders, meanwhile, criticized the ruling. In a statement, Lorena Gonzalez, president of the California Labor Federation AFL-CIO, said the decision allows \"tech corporations to buy their way out of basic labor laws.\"\n\n\"AB 5 granted virtually all California workers the right to be paid for all hours worked, health and safety standards, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and the right to organize,\" Gonzalez added. \"Ride-share and delivery drivers deserve those rights as well,\"\n\nUber Stock: Risk Of Repeal 'Key Overhang'\n\nBefore the ruling, Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote to the clients that the risk of Prop 22's repeal has been a \"key overhang\" for Uber, Lyft and DoorDash stock. That implied a \"favorable judgment tomorrow would drive a positive reaction,\" he told clients in a note late Wednesday.\n\nJefferies estimates that reverting back to AB 5 would result in additional costs equivalent to 65% of Lyft's estimated 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). It would equal 40% of Doordash's estimated 2025 EBITDA and 10% of Uber's 2025 EBITDA, according to Jefferies estimates.\n\nHowever, Colantuoni told clients to \"expect the actual stock reaction from the ruling to be smaller, given current valuations likely embed some probability of a positive ruling, particularly following the Justices' comments during oral arguments.\"\n\nDoorDash will report second quarter earnings on Aug. 1. Uber will report Q2 results on Aug. 6. Lyft will report its quarterly results Aug. 7.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nTesla Robotaxi Push Brings 'Cloud Of Uncertainty' For Uber And Lyft, Analyst Says\n\nIs Amazon Stock A Buy Now?\n\nIBD Digital:

A key issue was whether or not ballot initiatives could be used to enact laws that are in contradiction to or modify laws passed by the state legislature, such as AB 5. AB 5, passed by the state legislature in 2019, spurred the passage of Prop. 22 and codified an \"ABC\" test for determining if a worker is an employee or independent contractor.\n\nThe ABC test -- outlined in an earlier California Supreme Court ruling -- held that only workers who are free from control and direction by the hiring entity, performing work outside the usual scope of the hiring entity's business, and are independently engaged in the work they are hired by the hiring entity for are actually independent contractors. The ruling and legislation were squarely aimed at so-called \"gig\" employers such as Uber and Postmates to require them to give their workers minimum wage protections, unemployment insurance, sick days, and other benefits guaranteed to California employees but not independent contractors.\n\nThe new ruling found that voters could use ballot initiatives such as Prop. 22, which was funded by companies including Uber and Postmates and excluded app-based drivers from AB 5, to amend California laws passed by the legislature.\n\n\"The power of initiative includes 'the power to abrogate existing [laws].' Accordingly, the people may alter existing workers' compensation policy without running afoul of article XIV, section 4,\" the court ruled.\n\nUnder AB 5, gig workers would have received standard employee protections; Prop 22. enacted less stringent protections but included wage guarantees at 120% of minimum wage, and a 35 cents-per mile reimbursement (as part of, and not in addition to the wage guarantee), a healthcare subsidy, and accident insurance.\n\nThe 2.3 million-member California Labor Federation, which sponsored AB 5 and opposed Prop. 22, painted the ruling as a blow against workers' rights.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that the state Supreme Court has allowed tech corporations to buy their way out of basic labor laws despite Proposition 22's inconsistencies with our state constitution,\" said CLF president Lorena Gonzalez. \"These companies have upended our social contract, forcing workers and the public to take on the inherent risk created by this work, while they profit.\"\n\nThe California Chamber of Progress, a center-left tech industry policy coalition that supported Prop. 22, noted this ruling is one of many that affirms the right of workers to choose to be independent contractors, not employees.\n\n\"Rideshare drivers want to be their own boss and set their own schedule. That's a top benefit of the job and this decision protects that independence,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. \"With New York, Massachusetts, Washington, and California all now agreeing on independent work for drivers, this really settles the question of gig worker classification.\"\n\nThe Chamber of Progress also warned that AB 5 protections at a national level could result in \"lost work opportunities for 3.4 million American workers,\" implicitly attacking new labor classifications put in place by the Biden administration.\n\nActing United States Labor Secretary Julie Su, who previously implemented AB 5 as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, adopted a test similar to the ABC test nationally as a federal regulation earlier this year. With the United States Supreme Court ruling overturning Chevron deference, which had previously required courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes, Su's new rule could be overturned by one of the many cases challenging it.", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@ccenterdispatch.com",

The proposition passed 58.6%-41.4% when it appeared on the ballot in November 2020.

The coalition argued the measure allowed drivers to remain flexible with their hours while still providing for some health benefits.

A key issue was whether or not ballot initiatives could be used to enact laws that are in contradiction to or modify laws passed by the state legislature, such as AB 5. AB 5, passed by the state legislature in 2019, spurred the passage of Prop. 22 and codified an \"ABC\" test for determining if a worker is an employee or independent contractor.\n\nThe ABC test -- outlined in an earlier California Supreme Court ruling -- held that only workers who are free from control and direction by the hiring entity, performing work outside the usual scope of the hiring entity's business, and are independently engaged in the work they are hired by the hiring entity for are actually independent contractors. The ruling and legislation were squarely aimed at so-called \"gig\" employers such as Uber and Postmates to require them to give their workers minimum wage protections, unemployment insurance, sick days, and other benefits guaranteed to California employees but not independent contractors.\n\nThe new ruling found that voters could use ballot initiatives such as Prop. 22, which was funded by companies including Uber and Postmates and excluded app-based drivers from AB 5, to amend California laws passed by the legislature.\n\n\"The power of initiative includes 'the power to abrogate existing [laws].' Accordingly, the people may alter existing workers' compensation policy without running afoul of article XIV, section 4,\" the court ruled.\n\nUnder AB 5, gig workers would have received standard employee protections; Prop 22. enacted less stringent protections but included wage guarantees at 120% of minimum wage, and a 35 cents-per mile reimbursement (as part of, and not in addition to the wage guarantee), a healthcare subsidy, and accident insurance.\n\nThe 2.3 million-member California Labor Federation, which sponsored AB 5 and opposed Prop. 22, painted the ruling as a blow against workers' rights.\n\nMore from this section Oregon wildfire creates own weather as fires across Northwest burn Trump Finally Reveals What Biden Told Him After Assassination Attempt: 'You're Lucky To...' | US News Made on Long Island: Long Island Meal Prep in West Hempstead\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that the state Supreme Court has allowed tech corporations to buy their way out of basic labor laws despite Proposition 22's inconsistencies with our state constitution,\" said CLF president Lorena Gonzalez. \"These companies have upended our social contract, forcing workers and the public to take on the inherent risk created by this work, while they profit.\"\n\nThe California Chamber of Progress, a center-left tech industry policy coalition that supported Prop. 22, noted this ruling is one of many that affirms the right of workers to choose to be independent contractors, not employees.\n\n\"Rideshare drivers want to be their own boss and set their own schedule. That's a top benefit of the job and this decision protects that independence,\" said Chamber of Progress CEO Adam Kovacevich. \"With New York, Massachusetts, Washington, and California all now agreeing on independent work for drivers, this really settles the question of gig worker classification.\"\n\nThe Chamber of Progress also warned that AB 5 protections at a national level could result in \"lost work opportunities for 3.4 million American workers,\" implicitly attacking new labor classifications put in place by the Biden administration.\n\nActing United States Labor Secretary Julie Su, who previously implemented AB 5 as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency, adopted a test similar to the ABC test nationally as a federal regulation earlier this year. With the United States Supreme Court ruling overturning Chevron deference, which had previously required courts to defer to agency interpretations of statutes, Su's new rule could be overturned by one

The ruling possibly ends a legal battle that has gone on almost since November 2020 when California voters approved Proposition 22, creating the gig drivers' exemption.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the California Supreme Court ruled that the workers' compensation provision of Prop 22 were not illegal and the gig driver exemption could remain law. The issues in the case were complex, relating to whether the workers' comp provision in Prop 22 were illegally enacted given other laws that appeared to give full authority over workers' compensation to the State Legislature.\n\nProp 22 established that gig drivers such as those who work for Uber (NYSE: UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) were not covered by the state's workers' compensation laws. But as the court recounted, the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit against Prop 22, which includes the Service Employees International Union, argued that the workers' compensation provision in Prop 22 \"conflicts with ... the California Constitution, which vests the Legislature 'with plenary power, unlimited by any provision of this Constitution, to create, and enforce a complete system of workers' compensation, by appropriate legislation.'\"\n\nIn March 2023, the Court of Appeals for the 1st Appellate District reversed part of the August 2021 decision that Prop 22 was unconstitutional, citing the issues regarding workers' comp. The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court, which handed down its ruling Thursday.\n\nThe initiative power in California, which is what was used in the Election Day 2020 vote that approved Prop 22, includes \"the power to abrogate existing [laws],\" the court said, citing an earlier precedent. \"Accordingly, the people may alter existing workers' compensation policy without running afoul of article XIV, section 4.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with a lower court ruling that the law \"does not ... limit the legislature's power to enact workers' compensation laws.\"\n\nAB5, enacted in 2019, establishes legal definitions of when a worker can be considered an employee or when the worker is legitimately an independent contractor.\n\nIt has at its heart the ABC test, a three-pronged guideline that says a worker can be considered independent if:\n\nThe B prong has proved particularly problematic for independent owner-operator truck drivers and gig drivers, since the entities they provide their services for are transportation companies and they are providing transportation while being classified as independent. No exemption from AB5 has been granted to independent owner operators.\n\nIn a prepared statement, the Uber- and Lyft-based group Protect App Based Drivers + Services called the decision \"an overwhelming victory for voters' rights and the integrity of our state's initiative system.\"\n\nThe statement, quoting spokeswoman Molly Weedn, said the decision is \"not just a win for the nearly 1.4 million drivers who rely on the flexibility of app-based work to make ends meet, but for millions of consumers and thousands of businesses who rely on app-based services across the state. The courts have spoken, and this issue can finally be put to rest.\"\n\nProp 22 did call for some degree of compensation for injuries or illnesses on the job, according to a blog post by the law firm of Boxer & Gerson before the 2020 vote.\n\nIn the post signed by Julius Young, the law firm said Prop 22 \"provides that the companies must maintain occupational accident insurance to cover medical expenses and lost income 'resulting from injuries while the app-based driver is online with a network company's online-enabled application or platform.'\"\n\nBut Young added that the proposition did not define what constitutes injuries.\n\nHe also noted the limits of the coverage specified in Prop 22. \"Prop 22 would require occupational insurance cover medical expenses incurred only up to one million dollars,\" Young wrote. \"While this might seem like a big number, in catastrophic injury claims medical bills can sometimes exceed one million dollars.

AB5 would require companies to reclassify drivers as employees, thereby subjecting them to California's minimum wage, overtime, and full benefits regulations. However, in August 2021, a lower court judge deemed Prop 22 unconstitutional, a ruling that was later overturned by a three-judge panel in the California Court of Appeals in March 2023. The Supreme Court of California heard oral arguments in May and will issue its ruling today.\n\nFinancial Implications: According to Jefferies, if Prop 22 had been repealed, the additional costs for Lyft , DoorDash, and Uber could have been substantial by 2025. They estimated added costs of around $300 million for Lyft, $1 billion for DoorDash, and $1.1 billion for Uber. These expenses would have represented approximately 1.8%, 1.1%, and 0.6% of bookings and would amount to about 65%, 40%, and 10% of each company's projected 2025 EBITDA, respectively.\n\nJefferies analysts suggest that these companies have multiple ways to mitigate these potential financial burdens. Assuming 90% of the additional costs could be passed on to consumers through higher fees, and considering a 0.5 consumer price elasticity, the net EBITDA impact would be significantly reduced. Jefferies projects that the additional costs could be offset by approximately 85%, leading to a net EBITDA decline of about $50 million for Lyft, $150 million for DoorDash, and $160 million for Uber, equating to 10%, 6%, and 2% of their respective projected 2025 EBITDA. However, increased fees might reduce long-term consumer adoption in California.\n\nMarket Reactions and Projections: During oral arguments, three Justices hinted at constitutional requirements to share lawmaking authority with the electorate, indicating strong support among the seven-member panel for Prop 22. With the Supreme Court's ruling in favor, Jefferies anticipates a positive market reaction for the impacted stocks.\n\nApplying their price target (PT)-implied 2025 EV/EBITDA multiples -- 11x for Lyft and 25x for both DoorDash and Uber -- to the estimated EBITDA offset, Jefferies projects a potential increase in share values. They estimate the ruling could add roughly $1.25 per share for Lyft, $8.25 per share for DoorDash, and $1.80 per share for Uber. This represents about 10%, 8%, and 3% of their respective closing prices as of the previous day. However, Jefferies anticipates that the actual stock reaction might be smaller, as current valuations likely already consider some probability of a favorable ruling, particularly after the Justices' comments during oral arguments.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Assembly_Bill_5_(2019)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Assembly Bill 5 (2019)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoorDash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DoorDash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_before_interest,_taxes,_depreciation,_and_amortization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_ballot_proposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California ballot proposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_courts_of_appeal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California courts of appeal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEI710FI_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Independent Contractors", "body": "(CN) -- The California Supreme Court on Thursday rebuffed a union-backed challenge to the voter-approved law that exempts app-based drivers working for companies such as Uber, Lyft and DoorDash from being classified as employees rather than independent contractors under the state's labor code.\n\nThe court in an unanimous decision said Proposition 22, which passed with 59% of the vote in November 2020 and has since been encoded, doesn't conflict with a provision of the state's constitution from 1918 that purports to give the Legislature plenary power \"unlimited by any provision of this Constitution\" over workers' compensation law.\n\nAs such, the court upheld a split decision by a state appellate court two years ago, which in interpreting the meaning of that provision, article XIV, section 4, said voters and the Legislature \"jointly and severally have authority to create a workers' compensation system.\"\n\n\"We agree with the Court of Appeal that it seems 'most improbable' that the voters in 1918 -- seven years after they 'approved a far-reaching measure incorporating a broad initiative power as part of the California Constitution' -- would have intended, 'without any direct or explicit statement to this effect, to limit the use of the initiative power by virtue of the language' in article XIV, section 4,\" Associate Justice Goodwin Liu said.\n\nThe opinion relied in great part on a previous case where the court analyzed nearly identical language in the state's constitution that appeared to give the Legislature unlimited power with respect to the authority and expansion of the Public Utilities Commission at the exclusion of ballot initiatives.\n\nIn that decision, as cited by Liu, the court observed that the 1911 amendment to the California Constitution \"to provide for the initiative and referendum signifies one of the outstanding achievements of the progressive movement of the early 1900's.\"\n\nEven the plaintiffs admit, Liu said, that the meaning of \"unlimited\" can't mean that the Legislative can disregard any and all constitutional bounds on the workers' compensation laws it enacts.\n\nAt a hearing in May, Associate Justice Joshua Groban questioned the union's interpretation of the \"unlimited\" power in the 1918 constitutional amendment insofar as it implied that voters gave lawmakers unrestricted power to pass any law when it came to workers' compensation, even otherwise unconstitutional ones such as limiting workers' comp to men only, the justice observed.\n\n\"The clause requires interpretation,\" Liu said, \"and without a specific indication that the 1918 voters who enacted the clause meant to limit the initiative power, it is 'our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is\n\nchallenged in order that the right be not improperly annulled.'\"\n\nA group of Uber and Lyft drivers backed by the Service Employees International Union initially prevailed in their challenge to enactment of the ballot initiative, which had been funded by the gig economy juggernauts, when Alameda County Superior Court Judge Frank Roesch agreed with them in August 2021 that the entirety of Proposition 22 was unenforceable.\n\nThat decision was reversed on appeal, prompting the plaintiffs to ask the California Supreme Court to take up the case.\n\n\"We're disappointed in today's ruling,\" said Tia Orr, executive director of Service Employees International Union California. \"Still, we are hopeful that an earlier ruling which validated the state legislature's authority to pass laws enabling rideshare drivers to join together in a union gives workers a path to collectively bargain for better pay, benefits and protections.\"\n\nProtect App Based Drivers + Services, the industry group that defended Proposition 22 along with the California attorney general, called the decision an overwhelming victory for voters' rights and the integrity of California's initiative system.\n\n\"This ruling is not just a win for the nearly 1.4 million drivers who rely on the flexibility of app-based work to make ends meet, but for millions of consumers and thousands of businesses who rely on app-based services across the state\" said Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for the organization. \"The courts have spoken, and this issue can finally be put to rest.\"", "source": {"uri": "scvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SCVNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwin_Liu",

The case was then appealed to the Supreme Court, which handed down its ruling Thursday.\n\nThe initiative power in California, which is what was used in the Election Day 2020 vote that approved Prop 22, includes \"the power to abrogate existing [laws],\" the court said, citing an earlier precedent. \"Accordingly, the people may alter existing workers' compensation policy without running afoul of article XIV, section 4.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with a lower court ruling that the law \"does not ... limit the legislature's power to enact workers' compensation laws.\"\n\nAB5, enacted in 2019, establishes legal definitions of when a worker can be considered an employee or when the worker is legitimately an independent contractor.\n\nABC test is the core of AB5\n\nIt has at its heart the ABC test, a three-pronged guideline that says a worker can be considered independent if:\n\nThe B prong has proved particularly problematic for independent owner-operator truck drivers and gig drivers, since the entities they provide their services for are transportation companies and they are providing transportation while being classified as independent. No exemption from AB5 has been granted to independent owner operators.\n\nIn a prepared statement, the Uber- and Lyft-based group Protect App Based Drivers + Services called the decision \"an overwhelming victory for voters' rights and the integrity of our state's initiative system.\"\n\nThe statement, quoting spokeswoman Molly Weedn, said the decision is \"not just a win for the nearly 1.4 million drivers who rely on the flexibility of app-based work to make ends meet, but for millions of consumers and thousands of businesses who rely on app-based services across the state. The courts have spoken, and this issue can finally be put to rest.\"\n\nWhat Prop 22 does say about workers' comp\n\nProp 22 did call for some degree of compensation for injuries or illnesses on the job, according to a blog post by the law firm of Boxer & Gerson before the 2020 vote.\n\nIn the post signed by Julius Young, the law firm said Prop 22 \"provides that the companies must maintain occupational accident insurance to cover medical expenses and lost income 'resulting from injuries while the app-based driver is online with a network company's online-enabled application or platform.'\"\n\nBut Young added that the proposition did not define what constitutes injuries.\n\nHe also noted the limits of the coverage specified in Prop 22. \"Prop 22 would require occupational insurance cover medical expenses incurred only up to one million dollars,\" Young wrote. \"While this might seem like a big number, in catastrophic injury claims medical bills can sometimes exceed one million dollars. If a worker has a long hospitalization, multiple surgeries, a long period of rehabilitation, and followup care over a period of years, bills can be astronomical.\"\n\nYoung summed up his post by noting he was voting against Prop 22.\n\nThe Prop 22 case put the state of California in the odd position of defending an action meant to limit AB5 while at the same time defending AB5 in the still-ongoing California Trucking Association case against the law. But the state's position is to defend the people, who had voted on Election Day 2020 in favor of Prop 22, which had been backed and financially supported by Uber and Lyft.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nBacked by big companies and labor, Supply Chain Council debuts\n\nVictory for a 3PL again -- TQL -- in case involving broker liability", "source": {"uri": "freightwaves.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FreightWaves"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_kingston@freightwaves.com", "name": "John Kingston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_California_Proposition_22", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2000 California Proposition 22"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Assembly_Bill_5_(2019)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Assembly Bill 5 (2019)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_compensation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Workers' compensation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gig worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kingston, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/25/021223-76.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763991", "eventUri": "eng-9763991", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The California Supreme Court ruled Thursday that app-based ride-hailing and delivery services like Uber and Lyft can continue treating their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.\n\nThe unanimous decision by the state's top court is a big win for tech giants. It also ends a yearslong legal battle between labor unions and tech companies over a law dictating the status of app-based service workers in the state.\n\nThe ruling upholds a voter-approved law passed in 2020 that said drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft are independent contractors and are not entitled to benefits like overtime pay, paid sick leave and unemployment insurance. Opponents said the law was illegal in part because it limited the state Legislature's authority to change the law or pass laws about workers' compensation programs.\n\nA lower court ruling in 2021 had said the measure was illegal, but an appeals court reversed that decision last year. The California Supreme Court's decision means companies like Uber and Lyft can continue their operations as before.\n\nUber called the ruling \"a victory\" for drivers. Companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash spent $200 million on a campaign in 2020 to help the law pass.\n\n\"Whether drivers or couriers choose to earn just a few hours a week or more, their freedom to work when and how they want is now firmly etched into California law, putting an end to misguided attempts to force them into an employment model that they overwhelmingly do not want,\" the company said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe ruling is a defeat for labor unions and their allies in the Legislature who fought to secure more rights for drivers.\n\n\"What's going on is not just. It's not what California is about,\" said Nicole Moore, president of Los Angeles-based Rideshare Drivers United. \"It's a sad day for workers.\"\n\nLabor unions vowed to continue fighting for drivers' job protections and benefits, noting that an earlier ruling in the appeal process had opened doors for the Legislature to pass laws to allow drivers to join a union.\n\n\"We are committed to fiercely backing workers across our economy who have been written out and left behind and helping them knock down big obstacles to winning their union rights,\" Service Employees International Union President April Verrett said in a statement.\n\nLawmakers in 2019 passed a law aimed directly at Uber and Lyft, mandating they provide drivers with protections like minimum wage, overtime, health insurance and reimbursement for expenses. It changed the rules in California of who is an employee and who is an independent contractor.\n\nWhile the law applied to lots of industries, it had the biggest impact on app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies. Their business relies on contracting with people to use their own cars. Under the 2019 law, companies would have to treat those drivers as employees and provide certain benefits that would greatly increase the businesses' expenses.\n\nIn November 2020, voters approved a ballot proposition to exempt app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies from the law. The proposition included \"alternative benefits\" for drivers, including a guaranteed minimum wage and subsidies for health insurance if they average at least 25 hours of work a week.\n\nLabor groups and drivers across the nation are pushing for more job protections, higher wages and increased benefits. Drivers in Massachusetts are rallying behind what they describe as a first-of-its-kind ballot question that could win them union rights if approved.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

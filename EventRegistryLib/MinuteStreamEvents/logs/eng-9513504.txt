The Association of American Railroads trade group has said railroads were worried that the system could be abused by workers who try to avoid discipline by reporting situations a railroad already knows about.\n\nBut the idea of disciplining workers who report safety concerns undermines the entire purpose of such a hotline because workers won't use it if they fear retribution, unions and workplace safety experts said. That's especially important on the railroads where there is a long history of workers being fired for reporting safety violations or injuries.\n\nThe Norfolk Southern program is also limited in scope. Only about 1,000 members of the two unions representing engineers and conductors who work in three locations on that railroad can participate. Besides Norfolk Southern and now BNSF, only Amtrak and several dozen small railroads use the government reporting program.\n\nPart of why the big railroads -- that also include Union Pacific, CSX, CPKC and Canadian National -- have resisted joining the federal system is because they all have their own internal safety reporting hotlines. But railroad unions have consistently said workers are reluctant to use the railroads' own safety hotlines because they fear retribution.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Until NS became the first major railroad to sign on in January, all the major freight railroads had resisted joining because they wanted the ability to discipline workers who use the hotline in certain circumstances.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_freight_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail freight transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Railroad_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Railroad Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513504", "eventUri": "eng-9513504", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Bill Reineke of Seneca County, would loosen recently adopted state requirements for smaller railroads to install wayside detectors along every 10-15 miles of track.\n\nWayside detectors use cameras and sensors to catch malfunctioning or broken equipment on passing trains before accidents happen. Under language added to state law via last year's transportation budget, anyone who receives a message regarding a wayside detector defect has to immediately notify the operator of a train passing along it.\n\nThe wayside detector requirements were one of a number of rail safety reforms that lawmakers proposed in response to the release of toxic chemicals from a Feb. 3, 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, as well as a second derailment near Springfield, Ohio, and the death of a train conductor in Cleveland. All involved Norfolk Southern trains.\n\nBut smaller railroads have objected to the new rules, arguing that wayside detectors -- which can cost $200,000 or more apiece - are prohibitively expensive for them to install, even though the state provided $10 million in grants to help them cover the cost. The railroads also argue they don't need more wayside detectors because their trains move relatively short distances at low speeds.\n\nREAD MORE: Railroads balk at safety proposals being advanced by Ohio lawmakers after East Palestine derailment\n\nSB250 wouldn't apply to large Class I railroads like Norfolk Southern, which would still have to follow existing requirements to set up wayside detectors along every 10 miles of track (or up to 15 miles if the terrain is unsuitable).\n\nBut smaller Class II and Class III railroads would only have to install detectors every 25 miles and 35 miles, respectively, under the legislation. Class II railroads are regional railroads or branch lines, while Class III railroads include \"short lines\" that are often spur tracks connecting industrial facilities to main-line railroads.\n\nThe bill would also lift the wayside detector requirement entirely for stretches of railroad track where the speed limit is 10 miles per hour or less. That would apply to many Class I railroads, which have a speed limit of 10 mph for freight trains.\n\nDuring testimony before the Senate Transportation Committee on Wednesday, Reineke said that wayside detectors don't work when trains are only moving at 10 mph.\n\nGiven smaller railroads' limited financial resources, he said, the best way for them to prevent derailments is to make track improvements and maintenance, not buy expensive monitoring devices.\n\nOhio's wayside detector requirements \"will likely lead to the closure or interruption of service of some smaller railroads,\" Reineke concluded. \"This, in turn, will lead some shippers to move their product by truck, where they're increasing both the shipper's costs and ultimately the cost to the end consumer.\"\n\nOhio Transportation Committee Chair Stephanie Kunze, a Columbus-area Republican, said after Wednesday's hearing that she wants to hear additional testimony from proponents and opponents of SB250 before deciding whether to support the bill.\n\nWhen Kunze was asked whether she was open to supporting the bill, she replied, \"I'm open to having more hearings.\"\n\nIf SB250 clears the Senate Transportation Committee, it would still have to pass a Senate floor vote, a House committee vote, and a House floor vote before going to Gov. Mike DeWine's desk. All of that would have to happen by the end of the year, when the current legislative session ends.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_classes", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Railroad classes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derailment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Palestine,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Palestine, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Reineke", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Reineke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Southern_Railway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norfolk Southern Railway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seneca County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seneca County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductor_(rail)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conductor (rail)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Springfield, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_train", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freight train"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephanie_Kunze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephanie Kunze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_DeWine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike DeWine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Rail-fanning_and_Train-spotting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Rail-fanning and Train-spotting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Photographs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Photographs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513504", "eventUri": "eng-9513504", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 225025386, "title": "BU dorm named after English colonist will be renamed, school says", "text": "A years-long effort by a Native American tribe and Boston University faculty and students to remove the name of an English colonist from one of the school\u2019s dorm finally bore fruit last week when the university announced the building would be renamed. The Board of Trustees approved a name change for Myles Standish Hall after the Faculty Council overwhelmingly voted in favor of the change, interim university President Kenneth Freeman wrote in a letter to the council on Thursday. The dorm will be known by its address, 610 Beacon St., at least for the time being. Community members had asked BU to change the name of the hall because of Standish\u2019s violent history as a colonial military leader. The settler is known for leading the Massacre at Wessagusset, where he attacked members of the Massachusett Tribe under a false pretense of a peace dinner. Several Natives were killed, and Standish displayed the severed head of a man named Wituwamat at the Plymouth colony for several months. The movement to remove the name, started by the Massachusett Tribe, was a culmination of community efforts and perseverance, said Anna Ward and Laura Jim\u00e9nez, both lecturers at BU who helped lead the movement. \u201cIt\u2019s not just [Ward] and I,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez, senior lecturer in language and literacy education and associate dean of equity, diversity and inclusion at BU\u2019s Wheelock College of Education and Human Development, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Massachusett making the request, the students picking it up and going through all those channels, it\u2019s us talking to our peers and going to other colleges. Over and over and over, it was more about educating ourselves and taking away that ignorance on our part and saying, \u2018Okay, this is a real issue.\u2019\u201d Standish had no connections to BU The residence hall \u2014 a prominent building that serves as the eastern gateway to BU\u2019s main campus \u2014 jarred Ward when she first entered campus in the spring of 2022, she said. \u201cI\u2019m not from the Northeast, but I have an understanding of who this person was, and the importance of our colonial history as it\u2019s been taught to us, and it just surprised me,\u201d Ward, a lecturer in the counseling psychology and applied human development department, said. Ward is a tribally enrolled member of the Osage Nation. Jim\u00e9nez, on the other hand, has worked at BU for about 12 years and hadn\u2019t known about the controversy surrounding the name until she saw flyers around the school asking for the dorm to be renamed. BU itself has no relationship to Standish \u2014 the hall was named when the school bought the Myles Standish Hotel in 1925. In his letter, Freeman wrote that \u201cthere are no restrictive covenants or gift agreements associated with the Myles Standish name for the resident hall that would be violated by a name change.\u201d \u201cI felt angry\u201d: Previous renaming requests denied The Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag launched the effort to rename the building, which culminated in a petition that garnered over 900 signatures by fall of 2021 (it now has over 1,900 signatures). When it was sent to then-president Robert Brown, he rejected the call to rename the dorm, saying Standish\u2019s \u201crole in the history and founding of Massachusetts, and thus our nation, was significant.\u201d \u201cI felt angry. I felt like Boston University says that diversity and belongingness and inclusion is very important,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said of her reaction to Brown\u2019s refusal to listen to demands. \u201cSo here was this issue of equity and inclusive practices \u2026 and they were still denied.\u201d But activists weren\u2019t deterred. Students quickly picked up the call, penning an open letter \u2014 which was eventually signed by over 170 student organizations \u2014 to the president and Board of Trustees advocating for change. \u201cIf Standish\u2019s actions were seen as detestable by members of his own colony, then why does Boston University find it necessary to celebrate him?\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe glorification of settler colonialism evident in the hall named for \u2018Myles Standish\u2019 has an impact on our community.\u201d Students Adam Shamsi, class of 2024, and Anne Joseph, class of 2025, also published a piece in BU Today outlining reasons for change. \u201cThe name Myles Standish Hall clearly isn\u2019t just an old name inherited from a purchase. It is a symbol of continued oppression. Until President Brown and the Board of Trustees agree not only to change the name of this building, but also implement actionable initiatives to uplift indigenous students, faculty, staff, and local communities, BU is complicit in perpetuating this history of oppression,\u201d Shamsi and Joseph wrote. Multiple colleges, Faculty Council expressed support for renaming Student efforts didn\u2019t get a response from administration, so Ward and Jim\u00e9nez decided to renew the push last fall. \u201cI said, what can we do as a college? And so that\u2019s when we wrote the letter, we wrote a motion to present to our own faculty and staff assemblies at the Wheelock College [of Education and Human Development] level,\u201d Ward said. When Wheelock faculty and staff voted in support of the motion, Ward and Jim\u00e9nez took the idea to other colleges within BU. The proposal then made it to the BU Faculty Council, who wrote a letter to Freeman requesting a name change in early April. \u201c\u2026at its May 16 meeting, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees voted unanimously to accept my recommendation to change the name of Myles Standish Hall to \u2018610 Beacon Street,\u2019\u201d Freeman wrote in the letter to the Faculty Council. \u201cIn my recommendation, I referenced the arguments and sentiments reflected in the Council\u2019s recommendation and in the petitions and letters the Council referenced.\u201d In his letter, Freeman thanked advocates both for and against the name change. \u201cI wish to acknowledge and thank the many people who advocated for the name change before I became president ad interim, and, particularly, the 170 student organizations who called for the renaming,\u201d Freeman wrote. More work to be done, advocates say Ward and Jim\u00e9nez said that the win is only a small step forward in making Native people feel more included at BU. \u201cIt should feel better than it does,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez said, adding that she wants to see historical context about Standish displayed in the building. \u201cIt\u2019s not about erasing history or just forgetting about Myles Standish. It\u2019s making an active choice to not honor him in this way, this very public way, with buildings named after him,\u201d Ward said. Freeman wrote in his letter that the school will include information at the entrance of the building that \u201cacknowledges the original name of the building and the role of Myles Standish in Massachusetts history.\u201d Ward and Jim\u00e9nez added they would like to see BU add an indigenous and native studies major or minor. \u201cWe are a world class, R1 research-heavy university, we are globally known, and yet we don\u2019t have an indigenous studies program,\u201d Jimenez said. As for the dorm\u2019s name going forward, the Massachusett Tribe suggested in its petition that it be changed to Wituwamat Memorial Hall in honor of the tribal member who was beheaded by Standish. In his letter, Freeman said it would be \u201chelpful to have the option for a donor to name a major, highly visible building.\u201d \u201cUltimately, I just hope it\u2019s a deliberate choice and that there\u2019s lots of people involved,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThat students, native people from the area feel like they have a say, and I just really hope that it\u2019s an informed decision that doesn\u2019t just land in the hands of the president or a small handful of people.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A Native American tribe was the first to call Boston University to change the name of Myles Standish Hall, in 2021. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/28/bu-dorm-named-after-english-colonist-will-be-renamed-school-says/\">BU dorm named after English colonist will be renamed, school says</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/28/bu-dorm-named-after-english-colonist-will-be-renamed-school-says/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/standish-hall-665684dd51e49-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:11:08", "author": "Emily Spatz", "authors": ["Emily Spatz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.297}

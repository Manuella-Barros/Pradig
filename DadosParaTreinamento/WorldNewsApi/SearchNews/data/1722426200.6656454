The actors, along with the film's producer Karan Johar and director Anand Tiwari launched the trailer of the film in Mumbai on Friday. At the trailer launch of the film on Friday, Triptii was asked for her opinion on being labelled as \"national crush\" of India after giving an impressive performance in the film Animal while male actors are called \"National Award worthy\" after their impactful performances. Ranbir's acting in Sandeep Vanga Reddy's film was highly appreciated. Reacting to this Triptii said that she, in fact, is happy with the appreciation and love from the audiences coming her way. She said, \"In my experience, luckily, I would like to thank god, because in my experience, it has been the other way around, as many films I have done in my career, whether they are the older films that I did earlier, or the ones that have released recently, I have received a lot of love from my audience. People have liked my work and have spoken about it.\" \"Initially when I came into the industry I always wanted that people should talk about my work and nothing else. Luckily, when my films have released, they have spoken about my work. I think these things motivate us actors to do better in life and to keep working on our craft and I think, that way I have been very fortunate,\" she added. Triptii, here, also spoke about doing Bad Newz and completing six years in the film industry. She said, \"(Working on the Bad Newz) was genuinely like a family working together. Everyday, on set, we would laugh and share jokes. It's an important day because I have been in the industry for six years and for the first time, I am at my proper Hindi film trailer launch. It's my first Hindi commercial film to be released and it's my first collaboration with Dharma Productions. It's a great feeling, and I am very thankful to everyone on stage for trusting me for this part.\" Tripti also spoke about doing her first comedy in her career of six years. She said, \"This is my first comedy film. I have not done any comedy before. I have heard that it was easy to make people cry but it's very hard to make people laugh. I realised that on the set. For me, comedy is the most difficult genre. Anand Sir and I did a lot of workshops. Ammy and Vicky, I couldn't ask for better co-actors than them. They are the kind of actors who work for the scene not for themselves. I received so much support from both of them. Half of your work becomes easy when your co-actors are supportive. And both of them were very supportive, when I was stuck somewhere, they used to go out of their way to help me.\" Triptii, Vicky Kaushal and Ammy Virk's Bad Newz, directed by Anand Tiwari, is scheduled to be released in cinemas on July 19.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/triptii-dimri-on-national-crush-ranbir-kapoor-national-award-worthy-performance-animal-been-fortunate-9422014/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Triptii-Dimri-Bad-Newz-trailer-launch.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:25:12", "author": "Komal Rj Panchal", "authors": ["Komal Rj Panchal"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.477}

Paul Faust, a 54-year-old telecom entrepreneur from Parkland, Florida, got involved in the controversial exchange as he voiced his objections against a flight attendant's display of a \"Free Palestine\" pin during the flight.\n\nAccording to Paul Faust, the incident began as mere discomfort but gradually escalated to outright confrontation, reported Daily Mail. It all started with Faust observing that the flight attendant is wearing several pins on her uniform, including one with the Palestine flag and the slogan \"Free Palestine,\" alongside a Black Lives Matter badge.\n\nInitially, Faust did not make any comments about it but after the flight attendant moved the \"Free Palestine\" pin prominently and deliberately to her apron when serving coffee and drinks Faust decided to speak up. However, all Faust did was mention the situation with the pin to the flight supervisor.\n\nTo his surprise, the situation escalated after the plane landed as an official from JetBlue made accusations that Faust has caused a disturbance during the flight. Eventually, even Las Vegas law enforcement was involved.\n\nFaust insisted that he had not engaged in any disruptive behavior on the plane, however, his statement remained unheard. In the end, Faust's return flight was canceled by JetBlue and the airline even banned him from any future travel on its flights. The company cited his non-compliance with crew instructions as the reason for the ban.\n\nFollowing the JetBlue incident Faust has referred to it as an act of \"blatant antisemitism\". His fellow passenger Rachelle Almagor also commented on the incident confirming Faust's version of the sequence of events that took place. She also mentioned that she felt discomfort in connection with the flight attendant's \"Free Palestine\" pin and its prominent display.\n\nAs a result of the allegations, JetBlue has ordered an internal investigation. The airline extended its apologies to Faust and referred to the incident as a breach of company policies. Additionally, the airline has initiated a revision of its pin policy, aiming to facilitate a respectful environment for all passengers and crew members. Social media is afire with criticism toward JetBlue Airways following the incident.

He said the passenger beside him, who he said was also Jewish, noticed the pin and was more upset than him. Faust added that he and the passenger quietly discussed Pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and the ongoing war in Gaza during the flight.\n\nHe said in the now-viral video that he felt the need to speak, privately, to the lead flight attendant when the crew member put on an apron and moved the Palestine pin on top of the apron, while not moving other pins she was wearing, so it still prominently showed.\n\nIn the video, Faust said he told the lead flight attendant, \"I just want to tell you I'm a frequent flyer, and it was upsetting that she wore that, and that she only changed that pin to the front of the apron, not the others. Maybe speak with her after we leave the plane. Just talk about how it was maybe a little insensitive, it made me feel a little uncomfortable. I deliberately didn't want there to be an issue.\"\n\nHe said he felt assured by that brief chat then went back to his seat with no issues for the duration of the flight.\n\nWhen the plane landed in Las Vegas, Faust said an official demanded to see his ID for causing a disturbance on the plane. Faust said he left the conversation with the official briskly, then found out the next morning that JetBlue had canceled his return flight.\n\n\"This all could have been handled internally. I intentionally didn't want to make a big deal out of it, then it cascaded, and they made it worse,\" Faust told Newsweek.\n\nFaust said he called customer service after realizing his flight was canceled.\n\n\"She read me the notes. It said 'Mr. Faust caused a disturbance on the flight, did not listen to flight crew instructions' - not true, there was no instruction I was given - 'didn't listen to the supervisor that met him at the gate ... And said Mr. Faust said everyone should go to Gaza so they can be killed.' Again, not true at all,\" Faust said on the Instagram video.\n\nOn Tuesday, a host of social media accounts were calling for JetBlue boycotts.\n\n\"Wow, this is absolutely inexcusable @JetBlue. I'm also a Mosaic member and will not fly with you again until this is rectified,\" wrote conservative commentator Dave Rubin on X, formerly Twitter, to his 1.4 million followers.\n\n\"Jet Blue cancelled the flight of a peaceful, respectful and sensible passenger because he's Jewish. Moreover, Jet Blue is allowing flight crew to wear pro-Palestine propaganda on flights and to harass passengers with it. Unbelievable. Boycott Jet Blue!\" wrote Paul A. Szypula on X.\n\n\"Woke Jet Blue canceled the flight of a Jewish passenger due to allegations from a pro-Hamas flight attendant who falsely accused him of causing a disturbance on the plane. Boycott Jet Blue!\" wrote the @ImMeme0 account on X.\n\n\"Boycott JetBlue immediately. Please share @coolguypaulfaust story as much as possible,\" wrote the @joanofjudea Instagram account.\n\nFaust added in the phone interview that he has been a loyal JetBlue flier, and he's been a member of the budget airline's Mosaic membership club for 10 years. Faust said he spoke to an official with the airline this week, who told him that JetBlue was already looking into changes to its uniform policy and that this incident would \"accelerate\" potential updates to that policy.\n\nHe also said JetBlue is investigating the incident. However, he said he hasn't received a formal apology in writing from the airline, which he believes he deserves.\n\n\"They have failed at every angle of this. They should put it all in writing,\" said Faust, who added that he doesn't plan to file a lawsuit against the airline. \"There still has been no apologies for completely fabricating the story they told about me or for the police report.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabe_whisnant@newsweek.com", "name": "Gabe Whisnant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust_(opera)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Faust (opera)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_apron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport apron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequent-flyer_program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frequent-flyer program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosaic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-cost_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-cost carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2388675/jet-blue-passengers.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=df63337be44a0e0329115eab1e15eb85", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545890", "eventUri": "eng-9545890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 403, "textEnd": 411}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Lauderdale to Las Vegas. On board the flight, Faust saw an attendant wearing several pins -- including one for Black Lives Matter and another of the Palestinian flag.\n\nWhen it came time for the drink service, the attendant, according to Faust, \"put on an apron and decided to move the 'Free Palestine' pin to the apron, and not the Black Lives Matter pin.\"\n\nFaust went up to the lead flight attendant and asked if she could speak to her colleague. \"I said, 'I don't want there to be an issue. Maybe speak with her after we leave the plane. Just talk about how it was maybe a little insensitive. It made me feel a little uncomfortable.\"\n\nRachelle Almagor, 45, and an Israeli-American who was sitting next to Faust on the flight, was also offended. \"My daughter lost her best friend in Gaza,\" Almagor told the Daily Mail. \"He was kidnapped and murdered. So it was very uncomfortable for me to have to see that 'Free Palestine' pin.\"\n\nFaust thought that was the end of it, but when he exited the plane in Las Vegas, a JetBlue staffer at the gate said he needed to speak with him about a disturbance he caused on the plane. According to Faust, they threatened to call the police.\n\nThe next day, JetBlue canceled the reservation for Faust's return flight. When he called customer service to find out more, he was told it was because he had caused a disturbance on the previous flight.\n\nJetBlue later reached out to Faust, a telecom executive and a 10-year member of JetBlue's frequent traveler program.\n\nThe airline was already working on its semi-regular update to its uniform policies, which included a change in its pin policy. The policy, which had been around for years, allowed crew members to wear two pins: one from JetBlue and one of their choosing, as long as it was not offensive. The company concluded that, in the current political climate and in an election year, it needed to tighten that policy.\n\n\"In light of this incident, we urgently expedited this change,\" JetBlue's Dombrowski said. Rather than wait until all the new uniform policies were implemented this summer, JetBlue quickly reached out to the Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants on several airlines.

On board the flight, Faust saw an attendant wearing several pins -- including one for Black Lives Matter and another of the Palestinian flag.\n\nWhen it came time for the drink service, the attendant, according to Faust, \"put on an apron and decided to move the 'Free Palestine' pin to the apron, and not the Black Lives Matter pin.\" (Photos taken by Faust's seatmate show the Palestinian flag, but it is unclear if it also says \"Free Palestine.\")\n\nFaust went up to the lead flight attendant and asked if she could speak to her colleague, he said: \"I said, 'I don't want there to be an issue. Maybe speak with her after we leave the plane. Just talk about how it was maybe a little insensitive. It made me feel a little uncomfortable.'\"\n\nRachelle Almagor, 45, and an Israeli-American who was sitting next to Faust on the flight, was also offended. \"My daughter lost her best friend in Gaza,\" Almagor told the Daily Mail. \"He was kidnapped and murdered. So it was very uncomfortable for me to have to see that 'Free Palestine' pin.\"\n\nFaust thought that was the end of it, but when he exited the plane in Las Vegas, a JetBlue staffer at the gate said he needed to speak with him about a disturbance he caused on the plane. According to Faust, they threatened to call the police.\n\nThe next day, JetBlue canceled the reservation for Faust's return flight. When he called customer service to find out more, he was told it was because he had caused a disturbance on the previous flight.\n\nTo watch Faust's Instagram post click here.\n\nThe airline was already working on its semi-regular update to its uniform policies, which included a change in its pin policy. The policy, which had been around for years, allowed crew members to wear two pins: one from JetBlue and one of their choosing, as long as it was not offensive. The company concluded that, in the current political climate and in an election year, it needed to tighten that policy.\n\n\"In light of this incident, we urgently expedited this change,\" JetBlue's Dombrowski said. Rather than wait until all the new uniform policies were implemented this summer, JetBlue quickly reached out to the Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendants on several airlines. In a matter of days, they were able to come up with the new policy.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, a second pin can only be worn if it's from a state, country or territory served by JetBlue; if it's a pin representing first responders; or a pin from the union.\n\n\"We are taking this matter very seriously,\" Dombrowski said, \"and conducting a full investigation into our crewmembers' actions.\"\n\nTo watch Faust's follow up post, click here.\n\nThis is not the first time the Transport Workers Union has found itself in the middle of issues related to the Israel-Hamas war.

France's men did not even take part in sevens at Tokyo 2020, although the women were silver medallists.\n\nThen at 20:00, a French men's football team coached by Thierry Henry take on the US in their opening group game in Marseille. The US men have not appeared at an Olympics since 2008 and have not won a medal since 1904.\n\nBrit watch\n\nNone in action. Team GB do not play football at the Olympics as the home nations cannot agree on how to combine - London 2012 being the only exception since 1960.\n\nThere is no GB men's sevens team at Paris 2024 as they failed to qualify.\n\nWorld watch\n\nUzbekistan face Spain in one of the two football group games (14:00) that open the entire Olympics. It is the first time an Uzbekistan team (or any central Asian nation) have qualified for the Games.\n\nWhen we say the US have not won a men's football medal since 1904, it is worth pointing out they did at least win two medals in the same competition that year. There were only three teams in the 1904 Olympic football tournament: one from a town in Canada and two from that year's host city, St Louis. The St Louis teams finished second and third, results that count in the IOC's record books as US medals. (The team that finished third got through the entire competition without scoring a goal. Least-earned bronze medal ever?)\n\nThe men's sevens isn't hanging around. A day before the opening ceremony, we'll be into the quarter-finals by 20:00. Fiji have won both Olympic men's titles so far. New Zealand, who were the losing finalists last time, play Ireland (15:30) in the day's final pool game.\n\nBrit watch\n\nTeam GB's archers will take part in their sport's ranking round for the individual events. This does not eliminate anyone, it is simply a preliminary stage that seeds the archers for the main competition.\n\nWorld watch\n\nEmma Hayes, who just left Chelsea after 12 years in charge, will coach the US women at Olympic level for the first time when they face Zambia at 20:00. The US won four of the first five Olympic women's football titles but have only been on the podium once since 2012, a bronze medal in Tokyo.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nThe first handball games of Paris 2024 run throughout the day as the women's event starts. France's handball team have shown incredible progress, going from a nation that never qualified for this event to the silver medallists in Rio and champions in Tokyo. They are also the defending world champions after winning gold without losing any of their nine games last year.\n\nUnder handball's rules, France as hosts got to choose their group having seen who had already been drawn. They wisely opted to avoid Norway, Denmark and South Korea, who have collectively won seven of the past nine Olympic titles and are all in the other group. France instead begin their campaign against Hungary, who came through a qualifying tournament to bag one of the remaining places, at 18:00.\n\nAround 300,000 people will watch from the banks of the River Seine as a parade of some 10,000 athletes takes place not in a stadium, but on boats for each team. The ceremony finale will take place at the Trocadero.\n\nNo Olympic Games has held an opening ceremony like this before, so expect something completely different.\n\nThe plan comes with logistical and security complications that have challenged organisers, who chose earlier this year to limit the number of spectators at the water's edge.\n\nThere is no sport scheduled at the Games on Friday, clearing the path for the ceremony to be the centre of attention.\n\nMore than 90 boats will be in use for the opening ceremony, carrying not only the athletes but also a range of performers that you will see throughout the evening.\n\nTheatre director Thomas Jolly, who is the show's artistic director, has pointed out there is no way to fully rehearse the show on the river. Instead, parts of the ceremony have been practised inside giant hangars and the boat captains are reported to have been rehearsing at a sailing centre.\n\nRoad cycling's time trial is a chance for Josh Tarling to get Team GB's Olympics off to a flying start. The 20-year-old won the European title last year and is considered a contender in the men's event, which for the first time at an Olympics uses the same course as the women's, taking in sections of forest alongside Paris monuments like the Louvre and Eiffel Tower. The women's time trial featuring GB's Anna Henderson, a European silver medallist, starts at 13:30 with the men's event at 15:34.\n\nIn the swimming, Saturday night brings a hotly anticipated three or even four-way contest in the women's 400m freestyle (19:55). US legend Katie Ledecky lost to Australia's Ariarne Titmus in 2021 and Titmus won last year's world title, too, while Canadian 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is the world record-holder. New Zealand's Erika Fairweather is also expected to do well. The Brits have a shot at a medal in the women's 4x100m freestyle relay (20:37). Adam Peaty will be competing in the 100m breaststroke heats (10:00).\n\nGB divers Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen go in the women's 3m synchro from 10:00. They won world silver in 2023 behind China.\n\nMen's rugby sevens is already on its final day. France will be hoping Antoine Dupont, who skipped the Six Nations to prepare for this, can lead the hosts to a famous title at the Stade de France. The final is at 18:45.\n\nBrit watch\n\nAt the Palace of Versailles, Team GB begin their defence of the Olympic team eventing crown. Saturday is the dressage stage of eventing (from 08:30), which is followed by cross-country and finally showjumping. Tokyo champions Tom McEwen and Laura Collett are back in the line-up this time around, joined by European champion Ros Canter.\n\nThe first hockey match of Paris 2024 features Team GB's men versus Spain (09:00). Spain are ranked eighth in the world. Team GB's squad is predominantly English, and England are currently the world's number two nation behind the Netherlands in men's hockey. Ireland's men face Belgium at 09:30.\n\nGymnastics begins with men's qualifying. Team GB are in subdivision one of three, starting at 10:00. Qualifying is what decides who makes the team final, all-around final and individual finals later in the Games. Max Whitlock, now 31, has a stated aim of becoming the first gymnast to win a medal on the same apparatus (in his case, the pommel horse) in four successive Olympics.\n\nIn judo (medal contests from 16:18), Georgia's Giorgi Sardalashvili produced a stunning result in May to become world champion in the men's -60kg division aged just 20. France's Luka Mkheidze, the Tokyo bronze medallist, will be going up against him, as will Spanish 2023 world champion Francisco Garrigos.\n\nRoland-Garros, the home of the French Open, hosts this year's Olympic tennis. It is possible that this could be the last major event for Spain's Rafael Nadal, an Olympic singles and doubles champion, who enters both events this time and teams up with Carlos Alcaraz in the doubles. Novak Djokovic has also said he is prioritising the Olympics - one of the few tennis titles the Serb has never won.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nIf you have just hopped across the Channel to Paris hoping to catch some of the Olympic surfing, bad news: it is in Tahiti, which is 10,000 miles away. This breaks the record for the furthest an event has ever taken place from the host city of an Olympics. Tahiti's Teahupo'o wave is considered world-class and Tahiti is part of French Polynesia, a semi-autonomous territory of France. The men's and women's first rounds take place on Saturday.\n\nTeam GB's Adam Peaty is expected to challenge for a third consecutive men's 100m breaststroke Olympic title in Sunday's final at 20:54. This time, he has described himself as \"the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at\" after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the world championships in February. Watch for China's Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink in the same event.\n\nMeanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men's 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps' former coach, Bob Bowman, to ask if Bowman would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22.\n\nTeam GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women's cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as a favourite, but is still ranked inside the world's top 15. Switzerland's Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot.\n\nChelsie Giles is the headline act in GB's judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent like Japan's Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women's medal contests begin at 16:49.\n\nIt is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events. This includes the women's team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11.\n\nBrit watch\n\nHelen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women's four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday's rowing begins at 08:00, with the women's four heats from 11:30.\n\nAt the women's rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women's Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30.\n\nKimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom's K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a \"heartbreaking\" Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games.\n\nEventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics' signature views.\n\nIn women's hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa.\n\nWorld watch\n\nIn gymnastics, it is the women's turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB's women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles - now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won.\n\nMen's water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day's Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023's world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men's water polo title whenever it's held in Paris - which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nIn women's street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event's world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan's Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00.\n\nNo sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing - 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day's Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men's epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary's Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France's Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men's epee and women's foil from around 19:50.\n\nTom Daley, now 30, is back for his fifth Olympic Games representing Team GB. He is paired with 24-year-old Noah Williams in the men's 10m synchro, an event in which Daley won a dramatic Tokyo gold alongside Matty Lee. Daley and Williams are top-ranked coming into Paris 2024 but the rankings do not fully account for the threat from China, whose pairing of Lian Junjie and Hao Yang have won the past three world titles. The final starts at 10:00.\n\nIn swimming, GB's line-up for the men's 200m freestyle is so strong that Tom Dean, who won Olympic gold in Tokyo, does not make the start list. Instead, Team GB will look to 2023 world champion Matt Richards and Tokyo silver medallist Duncan Scott. Watch out for Romania's David Popovici, who is a second faster than anyone else this year heading into the event (final starts 19:43).\n\nTom Pidcock is in the middle of an exhausting 2024. He arrives at the Paris Olympics immediately after Covid forced him out of the Tour de France, and then he will compete not just in road cycling but also in mountain biking's cross-country event, which starts at 13:10. Pidcock's electric performance to win this event three years ago was a British highlight in Tokyo, and he says defending that title is his priority.\n\nIn the men's team gymnastics final (from 16:30), GB have a shot at the podium. China and Japan have looked a class apart in recent years, but the Brits were third at the 2022 world championships and narrowly beaten into fourth by the US a year later. Max Whitlock was in the team that won bronze at London 2012 and has since had to endure back-to-back fourth-place Olympic finishes in this event.\n\nEventing reaches its last day of action, concluding with showjumping from 10:00. Will GB be able to take back-to-back titles? The British are fielding an extraordinarily strong team but jumping is one of those sports where a first tiny error can rapidly become a catastrophe. Anything could happen, no matter how the dressage and cross-country set things up.\n\nBrit watch\n\nAdam Burgess was 0.16 seconds away from a medal in canoe slalom's C1 event at the Tokyo Games. Burgess has embarked on what he calls \"project send it\" ahead of Paris - learning to \"send it a little bit more in the final\" to make sure he can truly compete for medals on the Olympic stage. Also sending it from 14:30 will be Benjamin Savsek, the Slovenian who won gold in Tokyo and remains one of the top-ranked in the world.\n\nSeonaid McIntosh, from a shooting family, took European silver in the 10m air rifle last year and is inside the top 20 worldwide. The final starts at 08:30. Michael Bargeron competes in the men's event from 11:00.\n\nIn hockey, Ireland's men play Australia at 09:00 before GB's women play Australia at 16:00. In rugby sevens, GB's women play South Africa at 13:00. Ireland play Australia at 13:30.\n\nOlha Kharlan is one of Ukraine's biggest Olympic names, a four-time world champion in women's sabre and a four-time Olympic fencing medallist. Kharlan qualified for Paris 2024 in unusual circumstances. She did not shake the hand of Russia's Anna Smirnova at last year's World Championships, Smirnova protested, and Kharlan was disqualified. The International Olympic Committee stepped in to guarantee Kharlan a place at the Games. The women's sabre final, which Kharlan will hope to reach, takes place from 20:45.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nSouth Korea are again the dominant force in men's team archery (medal matches from 15:48), but there is just a chance that Turkey disrupt that this year. Led by Tokyo individual champion Mete Gazoz, Turkey ranked a lowly seventh after the qualifying round at last year's World Championships but picked off the Netherlands and Japan in back-to-back come-from-behind victories to set up a final with South Korea. They lost, but Turkey coach Goktug Ergin has already proclaimed his team ready to fight for medals. It is the country's first Olympic appearance in this event for 24 years.\n\nTop coaches have described the Paris triathlon course as \"insane\". It is, at least, in-Seine. You start from the Pont Alexandre III bridge in view of the Eiffel Tower, swim 1,500m in the Seine - two downstream sections and one upstream - then run up a set of posh steps to start the 40km bike course, which introduced some cobbled stretches into the mix. Lastly, there is a 10km run back along the same course.\n\nIt promises to be a spectacular and challenging event, even by Olympic triathlon standards, and GB's Alex Yee will hope to be at the front of the action in the men's event. Yee won Olympic silver in a pulsating Tokyo contest three years ago. Norwegian Kristian Blummenfelt, who pulled past Yee to win gold that day, is back but has since moved up to Ironman distance then back down again, and it remains to be seen if he will master that transition. The race starts at 07:00.\n\nWomen's team gymnastics is one of the Olympics' worldwide blockbuster events. The United States will expect one of its largest TV audiences of the Games for Simone Biles and compatriots, assuming they qualify for Tuesday's final, which begins at 17:15. Becky Downie, back in the British team for a third Olympics, is tasked with helping to steer GB towards a podium finish. The women's team event is intensely competitive right now, and any of six or seven nations could take a medal, with the absence of Russian athletes also opening up the contest.\n\nThere is lots going on in swimming's evening session. Team GB have a real chance of gold in the men's 4x200m freestyle relay, having won the Olympic title in Tokyo and the world title in 2023. Tom Dean, James Guy, Matt Richards and Duncan Scott are all veterans of both victories and are in the line-up. The relay starts at 20:59. The women's 100m backstroke at 19:57 is expected to feature Australia's Kaylee McKeown, a three-time champion in Tokyo, against the likes of American Regan Smith and Canada's Kylie Masse.\n\nBrit watch\n\nIt is day one of dressage. Yes, you did just see dressage a few days ago. That was eventing dressage. This is dressage dressage, where GB have an extremely accomplished team featuring three-time Olympic champion Charlotte Dujardin, who could become Britain's most-decorated female Olympian with any medal in Paris. She is currently level with cyclist Laura Kenny on six each. The event begins at 10:00.\n\nFreestyle BMX begins with qualifiers featuring GB's Kieran Reilly and Charlotte Worthington (12:25 onward). Reilly is the men's world champion and Worthington is the Olympic champion. In the men's event, France's Anthony Jeanjean is an imposing threat to Reilly, particularly having demonstrated he can entertain a home crowd with a World Cup win in Montpellier leading up the Games. Australia's Logan Martin is defending his Tokyo title.\n\nJoe Clarke, who won canoe slalom gold in Rio eight years ago but was left out of the GB team for Tokyo in 2021, is back for Paris and begins his K1 event with the heats from 15:00. Mallory Franklin, the women's C1 Tokyo silver medallist and world champion, starts her heats at 14:00.\n\nGB men's hockey team play the Netherlands, the only team with a better world ranking, in their group at 11:45. Ireland play India at 12:15.\n\nTokyo bronze medallist Matthew Coward-Holley and 2022 world silver medallist Nathan Hales will hope to be in the men's trap shooting final from 14:30. Coward-Holley comes into the Games ranked third in the world behind Spain's Alberto Fernandez and Australia's James Willett.\n\n3x3 basketball is making its second Olympic appearance after a debut in Tokyo, offering a street version of the game using half a court. Latvia won the first 3x3 Olympic men's title three years ago and begin their defence against Lithuania (17:35), who proved a surprise package at the 2022 World Championships, getting all the way to the final with victories against teams including France and the US.\n\nSurfing presents a dilemma for writers of day-by-day guides: if it starts on Tuesday and goes through the night into Wednesday, where to put it? In case you want to follow the whole thing: the quarter-finals begin at 18:00 on Tuesday, the semi-finals will go past midnight, the men's gold-medal contest will be at 02:34 on Wednesday and the women's final will be at 03:15. Remember, this is because the surfing is in Tahiti, which is 12 hours behind France.\n\nThe US will expect to win the women's surfing title with the likes of Olympic champion Carissa Moore and world champion Caroline Marks on the team, but watch out for Brazil's Tatiana Weston-Webb, Costa Rica's Brisa Hennessy and France's Vahine Fierro, who used to live in Tahiti and trains there. On the men's side, Brazil's Gabriel Medina and US surfer John John Florence are two out of a dozen or more names in with a serious chance of winning. Tahitian Kauli Vaast, surfing for France, is an underdog who could exploit his local knowledge.\n\nWomen's rugby sevens reaches the final at 18:45. Will GB improve on fourth place in Tokyo? Can France go one better than last time and clinch gold on home soil? Will New Zealand be all-conquering again, or can Australia get back to their winning ways of 2016?\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nThe Dominican Republic's men's football team, whose squad includes Leeds defender Junior Firpo, are playing fellow Olympic debutants Uzbekistan (14:00). This might be both teams' best shot at a result if tough encounters against Egypt and Spain do not go their way.\n\nSomething jaw-dropping happened at Tokyo 2020: China failed to win one of the table tennis gold medals. To put this in perspective, China have won 32 of the 37 Olympic table tennis titles ever contested, and the one they missed in Tokyo was the first the country had not won since 2004. To rub salt into that wound, it was a new event, the mixed doubles, where Japan's Jun Mizutani and Mima Ito pulled off a come-from-behind win over Chinese rivals for gold on home soil. Could China possibly be denied again? Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha are the world number one-ranked duo coming into the Paris 2024 mixed doubles, which concludes with the final at 13:30.\n\nThe men's all-around gymnastics final begins at 16:30, an event where athletes compete on all six apparatus to decide the best overall gymnast at the Olympics. Max Whitlock made it on to the Rio podium in this event eight years ago, but defending champion and multiple world title-winner Daiki Hashimoto is the favourite.\n\nWe reach the freestyle BMX finals from 12:10, where GB's Charlotte Worthington and Kieran Reilly are proven champions on the world stage. This is freestyle's second Olympic appearance. To win gold, perform as many tricks as you can in 60 seconds and make sure they are better than anyone else's.\n\nDepending on how Tuesday's heats went, Wednesday could bring a medal opportunity for GB's Mallory Franklin in the C1 women's canoe slalom (final from 16:25). Australia's Jessica Fox, one of the greatest canoeists of all time and the Tokyo champion, will be one of Franklin's biggest rivals. Watch out for Elena Lilik, who beat Andrea Herzog - Tokyo's bronze medallist - to claim Germany's sole entry in this event.\n\nBrit watch\n\nRowing's quadruple sculls finals begin at 11:26. Britain are the world champions in the women's event and picked up 2022 world silver in the men's race.\n\nIn shooting, Lucy Hall, a European silver medallist in 2022, will hope to feature in the women's trap final at 14:30.\n\nJemima Yeats-Brown lost her sister and biggest fan, Jenny, to brain cancer just after winning Commonwealth judo bronze in 2022. Yeats-Brown says that has helped inspire a \"life's too short\" approach to competing that helped her secure fifth at the World Championships in 2023. She fights in the -70kg category, where medal contests start at 16:18.\n\nIn men's basketball the US-South Sudan game (20:00) pits one of the most dominant teams in Olympic history against a first-time entrant. South Sudan became an independent state in 2011 and its basketball federation joined world governing body Fiba in 2013, so getting to the Olympics about a decade later is pretty good going, to put it mildly.\n\nAt the heart of that story? Luol Deng, who played basketball for GB at London 2012. Deng, who spent a decade playing for the NBA's Chicago Bulls, holds British and South Sudanese citizenship. For years as a coach, he has been a driving force (and financial force) behind the South Sudan team's rise to Olympic status. Facing the US in Paris may be the pinnacle of that incredible story arc.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nLois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix come into Paris 2024 as history-makers before they even start their first dive. The duo won world silver last year, the first time Britain had won any women's diving medal at that level. If they win another medal here - the women's 10m synchro diving final starts at 10:00 - watch for some cartwheels on the BBC studio sofa, as Andrea's dad is Fred Sirieix, star of First Dates turned BBC presenter at Paris 2024.\n\nBritish rowers are used to heaps of gold medals - more than 30 of them in Olympic rowing. GB were the top rowing nation at Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016. Then came Tokyo and not one gold. They were 14th in the rowing medal table, which was a shock.\n\nThursday might be the day we know if the Brits are turning that ship around. Helen Glover will hope to lead an impressive women's four in the final at 10:50, while the men's four won the world title in both 2022 and 2023. Their final is at 11:10. The space of about half an hour could play a huge role in deciding if this Olympic regatta is a GB return to form.\n\nThe rowers are not the only ones who had a Tokyo to forget. Joe Clarke did not make the team despite being the defending Olympic champion in K1 slalom canoeing. Now, he is back and will hope to be a big factor in the Paris final from 16:30.\n\nThe women's all-around gymnastics final at 17:15 could see some remarkable history being made. If they are both healthy and nominated for this event, American duo Simone Biles and Sunisa Lee could make this the first women's all-around final in which the past two Olympic champions have competed. Biles won in 2016, followed by Lee in 2020. If either of them wins gold, they will be the first woman to win multiple Olympic all-around titles since Vera Caslavska in 1964 and 1968.\n\nBrit watch\n\nGolf found its way back on to the Olympic schedule in 2016 after more than a century in the wilderness (or perhaps deep rough). At Paris 2024, the course is L'Albatros at Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2018. The first round of the men's event starts at 08:00 and features GB's Matt Fitzpatrick and Tommy Fleetwood, Ireland's Rory McIlroy and a host of the sport's other big names.\n\nLuke Greenbank will hope to better his Tokyo bronze medal in the men's 200m backstroke (19:37) at the pool. Meanwhile, Team GB have been top-four material of late in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay so could pose a medal threat there too (20:48).\n\nBeth Shriever has remained dominant in BMX racing since winning Olympic gold in Tokyo. However, she fractured her collarbone at the sport's World Championships in May, meaning one of GB's big medal hopes has faced a race against time. From 19:20 we will see how that comeback has progressed as the early stages of her event take place. In the men's event, Olympic and world silver medallist Kye Whyte is returning from a back injury of his own.\n\nIn hockey, GB's men take on hosts France at 11:45, Ireland's men play Argentina at 12:15 and GB's women face the US at 16:00.\n\nBack at the pool, Katie Ledecky may have a shot at some Olympic history by this point in the Games. If she has won two medals by this point - very possible, given the 200m free and 400m free will have been and gone, and she has won golds in both in the past - then a medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay (20:48) would be her 13th overall, a record for a US female Olympian. (Three American women, all of them swimmers, have previously reached 12: Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin.)\n\nThe men's and women's 20km race walks begin at 06:30 and 08:20 respectively. Chinese veteran Liu Hong, the 2016 women's champion, is trying to end a run of five years - ages, by her standards - without a major title. Spain's Maria Perez is the world champion, having been on the brink of quitting the sport in 2022 after back-to-back disqualifications at that year's European and world championships. Another Spanish athlete, Alvaro Martin, is the men's world champion.\n\nThe first sailing medals of the Games will be awarded in the skiff class. For the men, this means the 49er, and for the women it is the 49er FX (a version designed to work with a lighter two-person crew than the 49er).\n\nSaskia Tidey is at her third Olympics and representing her second country in sailing. Tidey sailed for Ireland in 2016, then switched to GB for Tokyo once it became apparent that she had no suitable Irish partner available in the two-person event. Tidey and GB team-mate Charlotte Dobson finished sixth three years ago, and now Tidey is back with new partner Freya Black. The two were European bronze medallists in May.\n\nGB's James Peters and Fynn Sterritt, in the men's event, said before the Games they had been trying to put on weight after realising they were one of the lighter boats in the men's fleet. Britain are the defending champions in this event after Dylan Fletcher and Stuart Bithell won gold three years ago.\n\nKeely Hodgkinson, tipped to be one of Team GB's biggest stars in Paris, appears for the first time in the 800m heats from 18:45. The 22-year-old is hoping to upgrade Tokyo silver to gold in 2024. Earlier, Dina Asher-Smith will be in the opening stages of the women's 100m from 10:50. She, like Hodgkinson, won the European title in her event last month.\n\nJack Laugher will dive with his third different partner in as many Olympics when he competes in the men's 3m synchro diving from 10:00. Anthony Harding is Laugher's team-mate this time. They have won two world silver medals together, each time behind China. Laugher won this event with Chris Mears at Rio 2016.\n\nIt is BMX racing finals day. If Beth Shriever and Kye Whyte have recovered from pre-Games injuries and are still in the running, they will have to negotiate the semi-finals before the gold-medal races from 20:35. Both riders are in the world's top six. France have a trio of highly rated riders on the men's side, while Australia's Saya Sakakibara is seeking redemption in the women's event after a semi-final crash in Tokyo.\n\nBryony Page stunned the field when she took the first Olympic trampoline medal in Britain's history, silver in 2016. She added bronze in Tokyo and has won two of the past three world titles, setting up one another bid for gold aged 33 before she pursues her dream of joining the acrobats at Cirque du Soleil. Qualifying is at 11:00 before the final at 12:50.\n\nLightweight scullers Emily Craig and Imogen Grant missed a medal in the women's lightweight double sculls by 0.01 seconds in Tokyo. Since then, they have won back-to-back world titles and are considered one of the British rowing team's best hopes for gold in Paris. The final takes place at 11:22.\n\nIn sailing, windsurfing reaches its final day. This year's windsurfing event involves a new class, iQFoil, which replaces the old RS:X class. The way the IOC explains the difference is that \"instead of floating, the board appears to fly\" in the iQFoil class because of hydrofoils that lift the board out of the water at certain speeds. Emma Wilson, who won RS:X bronze in Tokyo, has world silver and bronze medals in iQFoil and will hope to be going for a podium place on Friday.\n\nIn shooting, world number one Seonaid McIntosh takes aim in the women's 50m rifle three positions from 08:30. The \"three positions\" part means you shoot kneeling, prone (lying down) and standing.\n\nFriday's equestrian highlight is the team jumping final at 13:00, featuring a British team who took world bronze behind Sweden and the Netherlands in 2022.\n\nIn hockey, Ireland's men play New Zealand at 16:00, followed by GB against Germany at 19:15.\n\nBadminton's mixed doubles final (15:10) is highly likely to have at least one Chinese entry and it would be no surprise if, like Tokyo, the final was between two Chinese teams. Three years ago, Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong were defeated by Wang Yilyu and Huang Dongping. Gold medallist Wang has since retired, so silver medallists Zheng and Huang Yaqiong may end up facing Huang Dongping and new partner Feng Yanzhe this time around.\n\nArchery's mixed team final takes place from 15:43. In Tokyo, an arrow from South Korea's An San hit and split an arrow shot by team-mate Kim Je-deok on their way to gold in this event. This is almost impossible to achieve and is known as a \"Robin Hood arrow\". According to World Archery, this may have been the first time a Robin Hood arrow was ever filmed in competition. The two arrows are now on display at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nTeddy Riner will try to equal the Olympic judo record for three individual gold medals in front of his home crowd. The 100+kg event's medal rounds begin at 16:49.\n\nRiner is virtually unbeatable. Between September 2010 and February 2020, he won 154 consecutive contests. At the Tokyo Olympics, he had to settle for bronze after losing to Russia's Tamerlan Bashaev, his first defeat at the Games since 2008. He has not lost at Grand Slam or World Championship level since Tokyo.\n\nBritain's fastest female sprinter, Dina Asher-Smith, will hope to line up in the 100m final at 20:20. Asher-Smith has changed coach and moved to train in Texas since a disappointing eighth place in last year's world final. \"I want to win the Olympics and I want to run really fast,\" she has said. Big rivals include US sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson and Jamaica's Shericka Jackson. Richardson has the year's leading mark of 10.71 seconds.\n\nAt 16:10, the pommel horse final is Max Whitlock's chance to deliver on his aim of an unprecedented fourth consecutive medal on the same gymnastics apparatus. Ireland's world champion and pommel horse specialist Rhys McClenaghan will have his sights on gold. The women's vault final (15:20) may feature Simone Biles, the Rio 2016 champion, returning to an event from which she withdrew in Tokyo.\n\nThis is the last day of rowing and the very last final on the list is the men's eight (10:10). Britain won this event in 2016 but New Zealand were the winners in Tokyo. GB have recovered to win the past two world titles. Defending champions Canada, Romania and the US are contenders in the women's eight (09:50).\n\nIt is the penultimate night at the pool. GB smashed the world record to win the mixed 4x100m medley relay (20:33) when it was held for the first time at the Tokyo Games. This is a great relay to watch as there is a heap of strategy involved in looking at your team's strengths and weaknesses, then deciding who you put on which leg. It is often not clear which team's plan is paying off until the final moments.\n\nCycling returns with the men's road race (10:00). GB have qualified a full four-man team that features Tom Pidcock, who only just competed in Olympic mountain-biking last week, never mind half of the Tour de France before dropping out with Covid. The course reaches a climax with three laps of cobbled climb before a downhill stretch and a sprint towards the Trocadero.\n\nKayak cross is new at the Olympics. If you have seen snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics then - yes, that, except in whitewater. Instead of the usual Olympic slalom canoeing against the clock, paddlers race each other to the finish. They have to turn around in whitewater, flip their boats and perform all sorts of other manoeuvres along the way. The opening rounds begin at 14:30 and Team GB have some of the world's best athletes.\n\nSerena Williams, Monica Puig and Belinda Bencic are your last three women's singles tennis champions at the Olympics. Who will it be this time? World number one Iga Swiatek has Olympic success in her blood - her dad, Tomasz Swiatek, was a rower for Poland at Seoul 1988. The hosts will pin their hopes on Caroline Garcia making it this far. This is also the day of the men's doubles final, an event that includes Andy Murray and Dan Evans plus Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski for GB.\n\nElsewhere in the night's swimming action, Katie Ledecky has a shot at a fourth consecutive gold in the women's 800m freestyle (20:09). It could be close, though. Last time, in Tokyo, Ariarne Titmus was just a second behind her - the first time anyone had been within four seconds of Ledecky in an Olympic final over this distance.\n\nBadminton's women's doubles is a big target for Indonesia. Apriyani Rahayu won Tokyo gold with Greysia Polii and is now paired with Siti Fadia Silva Ramadhanti after Polii's retirement. China's Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan are the favourites. The two teams meet each other in the group stages, which may help set the scene for Saturday's final (15:10).\n\nLedecky is not the only athlete capable of racking up a fourth gold medal in an event on Saturday. Skeet shooter Vincent Hancock won gold in Beijing, London and Tokyo for the US, a remarkable record marred only by finishing 15th in Rio. This time around, Hancock is coming in ranked 17th in the world.\n\nAs of the start of Saturday, only six people have won the same individual event four times at the Olympics: Denmark's Paul Elvstrom in sailing, Americans Al Oerter and Carl Lewis in athletics, Japan's Kaori Icho and Cuba's Mijain Lopez in wrestling, and Michael Phelps for the US in swimming.\n\nNobody has ever won the same individual event five times at the Olympics (although it could happen in Paris - see Tuesday, 6 August). Ledecky at LA 2028, anyone?\n\nSunday at 20:55 is go time for the men's 100m final. Will Zharnel Hughes be on the start line for GB after a world bronze last year? Will Noah Lyles become the first American to win this event since 2004? Can Botswana's Letsile Tebogo pull off an upgrade on last year's world silver?\n\nRoland Garros hosts the Olympic men's singles final. Many fans would love a Nadal-Djokovic Olympic final on clay here. They have met once before at the Games, in the Beijing 2008 semi-finals, which Nadal won. Realistically, the Spaniard may have a better chance of a medal in the doubles. Serbia's Djokovic, meanwhile, is trying to win the one big title still missing from his collection.\n\nThe final round of the men's golf competition begins at 08:00. American Xander Schauffele will be in Paris to defend his title, and he has said an Olympic gold medal is proving increasingly valuable in a sport that, until Rio 2016, was all about its four majors. Spain's Jon Rahm will be one of the highest-profile LIV Golf players at the Games.\n\nLizzie Deignan is the first female British cyclist to be selected for four Olympic Games. Deignan - the London 2012 silver medallist and 2015 world champion - is joined by national champion Pfeiffer Georgi, Anna Henderson and Anna Morris for Sunday's women's road race, which starts at 13:00. A strong Dutch team for this race features Ellen van Dijk, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes and Marianne Vos, who won gold in London 12 years ago.\n\nBrit watch\n\nCharlotte Dujardin and her horse Imhotep could be the stars of the show as the individual dressage event concludes from 09:00. Dujardin won gold in this event in 2012 and 2016. Her own team-mate Lottie Fry - daughter of Laura, who rode at Barcelona 1992 - could be one of her biggest challengers.\n\nIn gymnastics, Jake Jarman won world vault gold last year and backed it up with a European title in April. The 22-year-old has the chance to turn that form into an Olympic title at 15:25. Becky Downie could be a contender in the uneven bars from 14:40.\n\nAmber Rutter welcomed her first child to the world in April. Now she's shooting for skeet gold at Paris 2024 (qualification from 08:30, final from 14:30). Rutter missed Tokyo 2020 through a positive Covid test just before she travelled, which she says was devastating at the time but ultimately helped reshape her life goals to include both personal priorities and Olympic aims.\n\nThe first round of the men's 110m hurdles begins at 10:50. Grant Holloway was the Tokyo favourite until he \"lost composure\" in his words and allowed Jamaica's Hansle Parchment to thunder past. Holloway has since won both available world titles and is on the US team for Paris. In the women's 400m hurdles first round (11:35) watch for another American, defending champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, testing herself against Dutch world champion Femke Bol.\n\nThe last night of swimming at Paris 2024 (from 17:30) features four finals: the women's 50m free, men's 1,500m free, men's 4x100m medley and women's 4x100m medley. Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom is a big contender in the women's 50m free, while the women's 4x100m medley could turn into a classic US-Australia battle. GB won men's medley silver in Tokyo.\n\nThe table tennis men's singles final could be an opportunity for China's Ma Long to extend an extraordinary Olympic streak (13:30). Ma comes into the Games having won all five Olympic titles available to him since 2012 - three team, two individual.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nWe are well into the quarter-finals and semi-finals of boxing's various weights. In the women's middleweight division (75kg), where quarter-finals take place on Sunday, UK-based Cindy Ngamba is fighting for the Olympic Refugee Team. Ngamba is unable to return to Cameroon, where she was born, because of her sexuality - homosexuality in the country is punishable with up to five years in prison. She is the first boxer ever selected for an Olympic refugee team.\n\nFencing at Paris 2024 concludes with men's team foil (19:30), a perfect finale for the hosts, who are the defending champions. To score a point, you need to strike your opponent on their torso, shoulder or neck with the tip of your weapon. You also need to have \"right of way\" which, if you're new to fencing, is a concept best left to the referee, who decides which fencer has attacking priority at any given time. In the team event, everyone cycles through a series of mini head-to-head match-ups until one team scores 45. Alternatively, the highest-scoring team wins if the ninth and final bout ends without either team reaching 45.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

Both will take place at the Stade de France, where all the track and field events are being held.\n\nHow Many Gold Medals Will Be Won?\n\nThere are 329 gold medal events at Paris 2024 with a whopping 39 medals being won on the penultimate day of competition, Saturday, August 10.\n\nThe first medal of the Games will be in shooting - mixed team air rifle - and that is expected to be won at 10:30 BST on Saturday, July 27.\n\nThe final medal will be awarded in women's basketball at 16:30 BST on Sunday, August 11.\n\nWhat Sports Are New For Paris 2024?\n\nThe only new sport for the 2024 Olympics is breaking. It is a style of dance that originated in the Bronx in New York during the 1970s but has evolved to become a competitive sport.\n\nIn Paris, breaking will not be seen until the latter part of the Games, with the women's event taking place on August 9 and the men's on August 10. A total of 32 entrants, 16 men and 16 women will compete for the medals.\n\nBaseball/softball and karate both featured in Tokyo three years ago but have been dropped for these Olympics.\n\nOther tweaks to sports include a change in format for sport climbing. In Tokyo, there was only one medal on offer for both the men and women but in Paris there will be a combined medal for lead and bouldering and a separate medal event for speed climbing.\n\nKayak cross will also make its debut. It is a form of canoe slalom but four athletes in each heat race against each other, not just the clock.\n\nIn sailing two kite events have been added to the programme, windsurfer - iQFoil and kiteboarding.\n\nAnd in artistic swimming, men are included for the first time in Olympic history and there will also be a team acrobatic routine round making its debut.\n\nWho Is The Olympics Mascot For Paris 2024?\n\nMeet Olympic Phryge.\n\nThe name is based on the traditional small Phrygian hats the Olympic and Paralympic mascots are shaped after.\n\nIt is a symbol of freedom through French history and represents allegorical figures of the French republic.\n\nThe motto of the mascots is \"Alone we go faster, but together we go further.\"\n\nWill There Be Prize Money At The Olympics?\n\nWorld Athletics has announced it will become the first international federation to award prize money at the Olympic Games.\n\nThe global governing body said a total prize pot of $2.4m (\u00a31.9m) has been made available for this summer's Olympics in Paris, with gold medallists receiving $50,000 (\u00a339,400).\n\nIs Russia Banned From Competing In The Olympics?\n\nRussian and Belarusian athletes will be allowed to compete as neutral athletes, known as AIN (Individual Neutral Athletes).\n\nThey will not take part in the opening ceremony at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, says the International Olympic Committee.\n\nHow To Follow The Paris Olympics On The BBC\n\nThe Paris Olympics will be live across BBC TV, radio and online.\n\nParis is one hour ahead of the UK and the majority of the action will take place from 08:00 BST to 23:00 BST each day, although some events such as the marathons, race walks and triathlons are starting slightly earlier.", "source": {"uri":

However, there are some preliminary events in sports like archery for India that are scheduled for Thursday, July 25.\n\nWhere will the Paris 2024 Olympics Opening Ceremony be held?\n\nThe Games will start with an Opening Ceremony on Friday, July 26 which will be held on the Seine River.\n\nWhat route will the Opening Ceremony parade take?\n\nThe river parade for the Paris Olympics Opening Ceremony will follow the course of the Seine, from east to west over 6 kilometres. The parade will depart from the Austerlitz bridge beside the Jardin des Plantes and make its way around the two islands at the centre of the city (the \u00cele Saint Louis and the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9) before passing under several bridges and gateways.

France's Interior Minister G\u00e9rald Darmanin had told reporters in March this year that just over one lakh spectators will be paying ticket holders while over 2.2 lakh spectators will watch for free from the upper banks.\n\nA report in The Brussels Times said that the city of Paris started distributing 55,000 free tickets to spectators in May. These tickets were handed on a priority basis to families from underprivileged areas with the lowest incomes, young people, sports movements and people helping to organize the Olympics, including city workers and traders.\n\nBut for those who are buying tickets, prices for the lower quays spots ranged from about $100 to $3,000. Approximately 2,00,000 people are expected to watch the opening ceremony from inside apartments or buildings overlooking the river.\n\nHas Paris hosted the Olympic Games before Paris 2024?\n\nYes, Paris has hosted two Olympic Games in the past: the first one in 1900 (the second modern Olympics held in history) and one in 1924, exactly 100 years ago. This means it will join London as the only two cities to host the Olympic Games three times. London hosted the Olympic Games in 1908, 1948, and 2012.\n\nWhere will the Paris 2024 Olympics Closing Ceremony be held?\n\nThe Paris Olympics will end with a Closing Ceremony on August 11 which will be held at the Stade de France.\n\nWhat makes August 11 special for Indians?\n\nIndia has won the highest number of medals at the Olympics -- three -- on August 11. This includes Abhinav Bindra's gold in the 10m air rifle event and Yogeshwar Dutt's bronze.\n\nHow many Indian athletes will be competing at the Paris Olympics?\n\n117 athletes (plus a support staff of 140 people, thereby taking the final tally of India's contingent to 257) are headed to Paris for the Olympics.\n\nHow many medallists from Tokyo 2020 are competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics?\n\nOut of the seven medallists from Tokyo 2020 Olympics, five -- Neeraj Chopra, Mirabai Chanu, a majority of the Indian men's hockey team, PV Sindhu, and Lovlina Borgohain -- will be in action at Paris 2024. The only two medallists missing are wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Ravi Dahiya.\n\nHow many sports has India won a medal in at past Olympics?\n\nIndian athletes have won Olympic medals in eight disciplines: hockey, wrestling, shooting, athletics, badminton, boxing, weightlifting and tennis. Indian athletes have won 35 medals so far at the Olympic Games. India first participated at the Olympic Games in 1900, with a lone athlete, Norman Pritchard, winning two medals -- both silver -- in athletics and became the first Asian nation to win an Olympic medal.\n\nWho are the flag-bearers of India at the Paris Olympics 2024 Opening Ceremony?\n\nTwo-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu and table tennis veteran Sharath Kamal will be India's flag-bearers during the Opening Ceremony of the Paris Olympics.\n\nWho will be India's Chef De Mission?\n\nOlympic medal-winning rifle shooter Gagan Narang will be the Chef-de-Mission of India's Paris 2024 Olympics contingent.

These pieces of the Eiffel Tower were cut from girders and other bits that were swapped out of the Eiffel Tower during renovations. Since the French sometimes refer to their country as 'L'Hexagone' due to its geographical shape, the iron pieces from the Eiffel Tower inside the medals will bear a hexagonal form. A Paris-based jewellery house called Chaumet designed the medals. Around the iron pieces of the Eiffel Tower are disks of gold, silver or bronze. Games organisers have said that the metal is recycled, not newly minted.\n\nWhich country is expected to dominate the medals table?\n\nUSA. For the last seven Summer Olympics, Team USA has ended the Games at the top of the medals standings. This time too, according to predictions by Nielsen's Gracenote, which released its latest Virtual Medal Table (VMT) forecast for the 2024 Games one month before the Paris 2024 Games were to begin, Team USA will top the medals tally. Gracenote's forecast had the USA winning 123 medals, 10 more than it had won at Tokyo 2020. It also predicted China to finish second in the standings with 87 medals.\n\nAre Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at Paris 2024?\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the IOC initially recommended a ban from international competitions of athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus. Since then, IOC has allowed athletes from both nations to qualify as neutrals. Each qualified athlete is undergoing a vetting process by a three-member panel appointed by the IOC to ensure they meet certain eligibility criteria. According to a report in Reuters, not having actively supported the war in Ukraine and not having been contracted to any military or security agency are among the criteria. It must be noted that the IOC has barred Russian and Belarusian athletes from taking part in team competitions but are allowed to participate as neutrals -- without flags or anthems being played and will be excluded from taking part in the opening parade. Russia has denounced the restrictions as discriminatory and accused the IOC of taking part in a \"conspiracy\" with Ukraine. The Russian Olympic Committee has paid compensation to 245 athletes who failed to meet the criteria allowing them to compete, the RIA state news agency reported.\n\nWho is the oldest athlete competing at the Paris 2024 Olympics?\n\nMario Deslauriers, who will represent Canada in the equestrian events, is the oldest athlete at Paris 2024. Deslauriers previously competed at the 1984 and 1988 Games before returning to the recent Tokyo Olympics after a 33-year gap. Incredibly, Deslauriers was 19 when he made his Olympics debut in 1984. At Paris 2024, he is 59 years old.\n\nHow many sports will there be at the Paris 2024 Olympics?\n\nAt the Paris Olympics 2024, there are 32 sports across 329 events.

The IOC had set a goal of a 50-50 split among the more than 11,000 men and women, including backups, to compete at Paris 2024. However, the latest numbers from IOC suggest organizers might fall just short of that target. There is still a slight edge toward men among the 329 medal events at the Paris Olympics. The IOC has said there are 157 men's events, 152 women's events and 20 mixed-gender events. Of the 32 sports, 28 are \" fully gender equal,\" the IOC said.\n\nAre there non-binary athletes competing at Paris 2024?\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the registered entries to women's events in Paris include two athletes who identify as nonbinary and transgender.

Quinn won Olympic gold with the Canadian football team in Tokyo three years ago and returns to help defend the title.\n\nWhat sports have changed in Paris 2024?\n\nBreaking, commonly known as breakdancing, will be included at the Olympics for the first time in Paris. Surfing, which made its Olympic debut in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, found a spot again in the Olympic program. But it is not being held in Paris. Or France, for that matter. Surfing at the 2024 Olympics will take place over 9,000 miles from the French Capital in Teahupo'o, located on the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. Like surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing are also back for a second time.\n\nWhat is the oldest Olympic sport?\n\nThere are many sports that could stake a claim over the tag of the oldest Olympic sport. The ancient Olympic Games, as played by the Greeks, included running, long jump, shot put, javelin, boxing, pankration and equestrian events. Wrestling was added in 708 BC. The ancient Olympic Games were initially a one-day event until 684 BC, when they were extended to three days.

p.m. ET on Friday, will be held outside of a stadium and on the River Seine.\n\nThe ceremony parade will see more than 10,000 athletes cruising on boats through the Seine.\n\nThe Olympics will end on Aug. 11 with the closing ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, the Paralympic Games will run later from Aug. 28 till Sept. 8.\n\nCanada's Olympic bid will start on July 25 with the Canadian women's soccer team taking on New Zealand in a group A match.\n\nSwimming events will take place between July 27 and Aug. 4.\n\nThe athletics events will start on Aug. 1 and run till the last day of the Games, which is Aug. 11.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee has published the full schedule on its olympic.ca website, including when Canadians are competing at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nBreakdancing or breaking, which is an urban dance style with its roots in hip-hop culture, will make its Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nSkateboarding, sport climbing and surfing will also make a return as optional sports after debuting at the last Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nThe 27-year-old leads a U.S. women's gymnastics team filled with familiar faces and looking for redemption in Paris.\n\nMeanwhile, WNBA star Brittney Griner, who spent 10 months in a Russian jail for possession of vape cartridges containing cannabis oil, will also be one of the players to watch out for.\n\nGriner will be playing in her first international game since her release in a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe United States and China have topped the medal tally at the previous two Olympics in Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nTeam Canada will be hoping to better its 11th-place performance from the last summer Games.\n\nThe U.S. took home 113 medals, China won 89 and Canada had 24 in Tokyo.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title":

This time, he has described himself as \"the person with the bow and arrow and not the one being fired at\" after a foot injury and time away from the sport to focus on his mental health. He was third at the world championships in February. Watch for China's Qin Haiyang and American Nic Fink in the same event.\n\nMeanwhile, French swimming superstar Leon Marchand should line up in the final of the men's 400m individual medley at 19:30. Marchand is one of the biggest names on the hosts' Olympic team and is expected to end a 12-year French gold-medal drought in the pool. When he was younger, Marchand wrote to American great Michael Phelps' former coach, Bob Bowman, to ask if Bowman would be his coach. Bowman said yes and Marchand now has five world titles at the age of 22.\n\nTeam GB's Evie Richards, the 2021 world champion, features in the women's cross-country mountain bike event from 13:10. Richards is coming back from a concussion suffered in Brazil two months ago, so does not start the race as a favourite, but is still ranked inside the world's top 15. Switzerland's Alessandra Keller is the world number one. Watch out for young Dutch star Puck Pieterse and France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot.\n\nChelsie Giles is the headline act in GB's judo squad for Paris 2024. The 27-year-old won bronze in Tokyo then added European gold and world silver a year later. Giles is in the -52kg class, which is packed with talent like Japan's Uta Abe, who has proved a hard obstacle for Giles to overcome in the past and has been sweeping up medals lately. GB have won 20 Olympic medals in judo but never a gold, meaning there is history on the line. Women's medal contests begin at 16:49.\n\nIt is impossible to look past South Korea in most archery events. This includes the women's team event, which they have won every time since it was introduced to the Olympics in 1988. Not only were none of the current GB team born then, but their coach was four years old. However, this GB team are made of strong stuff. Penny Healey and Bryony Pitman have each been ranked world number one in the past year, so this could be a real opportunity for them to shine. The event begins at 08:30 with the gold-medal match at 16:11.\n\nBrit watch\n\nHelen Glover, an Olympic rowing champion in 2012 and 2016, is back for her fourth Olympics. This time she is in the women's four alongside returning Olympian Rebecca Shorten and debutants Esme Booth and Sam Redgrave (no relation to Sir Steve). They only got together at the start of the year but were unbeaten at a string of major events in the first half of 2024. Sunday's rowing begins at 08:00, with the women's four heats from 11:30.\n\nAt the women's rugby sevens, Team GB face Ireland in the opening group game at 14:30. GB have finished fourth at the past two Olympics, whereas this is the Irish women's Olympic debut. Ireland go on to play South Africa at 18:00, while GB play Australia at 18:30.\n\nKimberley Woods will line up for GB in canoe slalom's K1 event (starts 14:30, final at 16:45). Woods had a \"heartbreaking\" Tokyo Games, finishing 10th, but believes she has grown mentally and physically in the years since. She is a contender in both this event and the kayak cross, which is making its Olympic debut later in the Games.\n\nEventing heads into its second day, the cross-country, from 09:30. This involves a gallop of nine to 10 minutes through the park at Versailles, twice crossing the centuries-old Grand Canal in what might be one of the Paris Olympics' signature views.\n\nIn women's hockey, Team GB begin their campaign against Spain at 12:15. GB beat Spain in a quarter-final shootout in Tokyo before going on to win bronze. Later on Sunday, at 19:15, the GB men play their second group game against South Africa.\n\nWorld watch\n\nIn gymnastics, it is the women's turn to head through qualifying. Britain are again in the first subdivision at 08:30. The United States and China are in subdivision two from 10:40. Team GB's women took team bronze in Tokyo three years ago. The US, who are the defending world champions, are led once again by Simone Biles - now competing in her third Olympic Games aged 27, with a coincidental total of 27 world and Olympic titles already won.\n\nMen's water polo begins on Sunday and is part one of the day's Franco-Hungarian action. Water polo is often described as the national sport of Hungary, who won 2023's world title and have nine Olympic gold medals in this event, although none since 2008. What better way to start than against the hosts? France have a tradition of winning the Olympic men's water polo title whenever it's held in Paris - which unfortunately for them has only happened once, a century ago. France play Hungary at 18:30.\n\nExpert knowledge\n\nIn women's street skateboarding, where teenagers are often contenders, France will be represented by 14-year-old Lucie Schoonheere. Nobody in the top 10 of this event's world rankings heading into the Olympics is aged older than 19. Japan's Coco Yoshizawa, also 14, is the world number one. The final begins at 16:00.\n\nNo sport has provided France with more Olympic medals than fencing - 123 of them at the start of Paris 2024, 30 more than cycling in second place. This brings us to part two of the day's Franco-Hungarian action. If the Hungarians are the strong favourites against France in water polo, the men's epee might give France more of a chance. Hungary's Gergely Siklosi and Mate Koch are the world number one and two respectively, but when Siklosi lost the Olympic final in 2021, who beat him? France's Romain Cannone. Cannone and veteran team-mate Yannick Borel are both in the world top five and on the team for Paris 2024. Japan and Italy will also be hoping to have a say. Expect the medal events in men's epee and women's foil from around 19:50.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The men's and women's final will each be contested in a 90-minute format designed to be more fan friendly than previous day-long competitions.\n\nAfter 112 years on the Olympic program, modern pentathlon is saying goodbye to its horses in Paris. The equestrian event will be cut after the Games following a scandal in Tokyo three years ago when a German coach struck a horse that wasn't cooperating with her athlete. Modern pentathlon is bringing in an \"American Ninja Warrior\"-style obstacle course for Los Angeles in 2028. Many top athletes are fiercely opposed.\n\nThe event has a low-profile start with fencing preliminaries on Aug. 8, but the first medals are awarded in the men's final on Aug. 10. The women's final on Aug. 11 will be one of the last events of the Games before the closing ceremony that evening.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@bostonherald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_pentathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Modern pentathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Laser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Choong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Choong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Micheli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elena Micheli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace of Versailles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palace of Versailles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bath, Somerset"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ninja_Warrior", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Ninja Warrior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Multi-Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Multi-Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OLY_Modern_Pentathlon_Glance__74128.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749071", "eventUri": "eng-9749071", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1602, "textEnd": 1608}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 1665, "textEnd": 1672}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 1695, "textEnd": 1702}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The women's team is the reigning Olympic and world champion.\n\nA roadmap to follow for the men's and women's handball competition during the 2024 Summer Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nMikkel Hansen, Denmark: With his shoulder-length hair and headband, the powerful left back is one of the most familiar faces in Danish sports. A three-time men's world player of the year, a record he shares with longtime rival Nikola Karabati\u0107, Hansen enters the tournament as a world champion. Hansen's only Olympic gold came eight years ago in Rio de Janeiro. Paris will be the last chance for the 36-year-old five-time Olympian to add a second. He is retiring after the Games.\n\nYahia Omar, Egypt: The right back will stay in Paris whatever happens at the Games because he's signed a deal with Paris Saint-Germain until 2027. The 26-year-old was one of Egypt's best players when the Pharaohs achieved a national-best fourth-place finish three years ago.\n\nNikola Karabati\u0107, France: The elder of the Karabati\u0107 brothers -- Luka is the younger one -- the 40-year-old Nikola is one of the greatest players in handball history. His trophy cabinet reflects that, with three Olympic golds and four world titles. He has scored nearly 1,300 international goals, and this will be his sixth Games.\n\nL\u00e9na Grandveau, France: The fresh-faced Grandveau took the handball world by storm with a stunning performance in last year's world championship final when, as an unheralded 20-year-old, she scored France's last four goals in a dramatic victory against Norway. Now that defenders are aware of her speed and finishing, she will be watched closely.\n\nHenny Reistad, Norway: Don't let Reistad, the reigning women's world player of the year, get a shot at goal or she will probably punish you, as shown by her 74% scoring ratio at last year's worlds. Reistad can play left back or center back and was a bronze medalist in Tokyo for Norway, the two-time reigning European champion.\n\nCan the French do the Olympic double-double? France's men's team has won three of the past four gold medals, including three years ago in Tokyo. The women's team is the reigning Olympic and world champion. Will playing at home in Paris be galvanizing for the players, or will the pressure of expectations be too much?\n\nEgypt surprised many observers by reaching the semifinals in Tokyo, knocking out Germany and then giving France a tough match. A multiple-time African champion, Egypt is hopeful about earning a first Olympic medal. However, Egypt is in the same group as Denmark, France and Norway, and has less strength in depth than the favorites.\n\nThe women's group stage gets underway on July 25, with the men starting two days later. Group games are in Paris before the competition heads north to the Pierre Mauroy Stadium in Lille.\n\nWomen's quarterfinals take place on Aug. 6, and the men's are the next day. The women's semifinals are Aug. 8, with the men's on Aug. 9. The women's gold medal game is Aug. 10 and the men's final is Aug. 11, the closing day of the Games.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikkel_Hansen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mikkel Hansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Karabati\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Karabati\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L\u00e9na_Grandveau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L\u00e9na Grandveau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_men's_national_handball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France men's national handball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahia_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahia Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henny_Reistad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henny Reistad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Mauroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Mauroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OLY_Handball_Glance_09291.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9749071", "eventUri": "eng-9749071", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 2705, "textEnd": 2712}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2888, "textEnd": 2894}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 2955, "textEnd": 2961}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2981, "textEnd": 2987}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 3020, "textEnd": 3027}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 3051, "textEnd": 3058}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Salukvadze's Olympic career began at 19 back in 1988 when she won gold for the Soviet Union.\n\nAmber Rutter, Britain: Rutter is aiming to compete in Paris just three months after giving birth to her first child. The two-time world champion is even more determined to make it to Paris because she was ruled out of the Tokyo Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nTune in early on the first morning. The first gold medal of the Paris Olympics is set to be awarded at the shooting range. The mixed team 10-meter air rifle competition is expected to conclude at 11:50 a.m. local time on July 27, the morning after the opening ceremony. It's a recent Olympic tradition for shooting to fire the metaphorical starting pistol on the medal rush. Yang Qian won the first gold at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo and Ginny Thrasher of the United States had that honor in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nThe shooting events can be a place for smaller countries to shine at the Olympics. Nineteen different nations won medals in shooting at the Tokyo Games, including a silver and bronze for the tiny country of San Marino, which is home to just over 33,000 people.\n\nShooting begins on July 27, the day after the opening ceremony, and runs through Aug. 5.

Here are 10 of the best in their sport to watch out for.\n\nThis will be the third Olympic Games for LeBron James, who won gold with the United States at Beijing in 2008 and London in 2012 but chose not to compete in the past two Olympics. In Paris, the United States is bidding for a fifth successive gold.\n\nAlthough this season was his 21st in the NBA, Mr. James remained elite, earning a 20th all-star nod and averaging a stat-packed line of 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.3 assists a game. Mr. James, 39, will be accompanied by a dizzying collection of big-league names, including Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Joel Embiid.\n\nNoah Lyles, 27, who trains out of Orlando, will enter Paris as the No. 2-ranked sprinter in the 100 metres and No. 1-ranked in the 200 metres. After winning bronze in the 200 at Tokyo and opening up in a post-run interview about his mental health, the American has spent the past three years becoming the most dominant sprinter on the planet.\n\nAt the 2023 world championships last August, Mr. Lyles became the first man since Usain Bolt in 2015 to win gold in the 100, 200 and 4x100-metre relay.\n\nHe's a six-time world champion. Fellow American Christian Coleman, who beat Mr. Lyles in March at the 2024 world indoor championships and is No. 1 in the 100-metre world ranking, will be Mr. Lyles's biggest 100-metre threat.\n\nSimone Biles, 27, shocked the world at Tokyo when she withdrew from four of her six events. Before those Games, she was a global superstar and expected to dominate, especially after a four-gold performance at Rio in 2016.\n\nHowever, the pressure of the Olympics, which she described in an Instagram post following a qualifying event in Tokyo as \"the weight of the world on [her] shoulders,\" along with experiencing a physical phenomenon called \"the twisties\" - in which gymnasts lose air awareness while performing twisting manoeuvres - led Ms. Biles to take herself out of the competition to prioritize her mental health and personal safety. Ms. Biles returned to training in the spring of 2023.\n\nThen, at the 2023 world championships in her first international competition in two years - and in typical Biles fashion - she won the all-around gold, surpassing Vitaly Scherbo as the most successful gymnast in history at Olympic and world championships.\n\nFaith Kipyegon will enter Paris after an incredible 2023 season in which she set three world records in three events in a 50-day span. The Kenyan runner eclipsed the women's 1,500-metre, 5,000-metre and one-mile world records in separate Diamond League events before, later in the season, at the 2023 world athletic championships, becoming the first woman to win both the 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre at the same world championships.\n\nHeading into Paris, Ms. Kipyegon, 30, is focused on winning a third consecutive Olympic gold medal in her signature event, the women's 1,500 metres. Earlier this month, she eclipsed her own world record in the event, finishing in 3 minutes 49.04 seconds, surpassing her record of 3:49.11, which was set in Italy last year.\n\nJapanese skateboarding prodigy Ginwoo Onodera, 14, will likely be one of the youngest athletes in Paris. After his second-place finish in street at the Olympic qualifying series in Shanghai in May, Mr. Onodera sits No. 1 overall in the Olympic rankings for the event.\n\nHe will be going up against the best skaters in the world, some of whom are more than twice his age. But the hype about Mr. Onodera isn't new. In 2022, he became Japan's youngest champion when he was 12.\n\nHe kickstarted his 2023 season with a bronze medal in street at his first world championships against a field of 32 established professionals. Then, in May of last year, in front of a home crowd at X Games Chiba, Japan, Mr. Onodera became the youngest to win gold in men's street.\n\nCompeting in his fifth Olympic Games, Hungarian fencing legend \u00c1ron Szil\u00e1gyi, 34, will have a chance to add to an Olympic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that already includes being the first male fencer in history to win three individual Olympic golds.\n\nHe won gold in the men's sabre in London, Rio and Tokyo. Hungary - traditionally a world superpower in fencing - is third in Olympic fencing medals behind only Italy and France, a reputation that influenced Mr. Szil\u00e1gyi to take up the sport when he was nine.\n\nAs a junior, Mr. Szil\u00e1gyi was coached by Gyorgi Gerevich, the son of late Olympic fencing great Alad\u00e1r Gerevich, who won a record 10 individual and team medals between Los Angeles in 1932 and Rome in 1960.\n\nTeddy Riner will enter Paris as one of the host nation's brightest stars. Considered by many to be one of the greatest judokas in history, Mr. Riner holds a record 11 world titles to go along with three Olympic golds in his four Olympic appearances.\n\nDespite his age, the 35-year-old is still a potential medal threat in Paris. He began his 2024 Olympic season by winning the Paris grand slam in February. The 6-foot-8, 330-pounder was given the nickname Teddy Bear by his peers.\n\nAnita Wlodarczyk - the greatest women's hammer thrower in history - has competed in four successive Games, winning gold in the past three. In the hammer toss, one of four throwing events, an athlete throws a metal ball attached to a grip by a steel wire. It had been a male-only Olympic event until 2000.\n\nSince Tokyo, the 38-year-old from Poland has struggled with injuries, but she is the only woman to win three Olympic gold medals in one individual athletics event and plans to make Paris her final Games.\n\nOlga Kharlan has 14 World Cup golds, four world championship golds, has been ranked No. 1 in the world in women's sabre for a combined five years throughout her career. What the Ukrainian does not have, however, is an Olympic gold medal in individual sabre.\n\nShe has competed in four Games between 2008 and 2021, but has never done better in an individual event than her two bronze-medal finishes in London and Rio. Ms. Kharlan made headlines in July of 2023 when she was disqualified from the world championships in Milan, Italy for refusing to shake hands with her Russian opponent, Anna Smirnova.\n\nInstead, Ms. Kharlan extended her sabre to Smirnova to tap blades, which she later said was meant as a sign of respect while still acknowledging the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The 33-year-old ranks sixth in women's sabre for the 2023-24 season.\n\nOne of the central focuses in Paris will be men's soccer, especially with the host French side potentially entering the tournament as a medal favourite. Last August, French soccer royalty Thierry Henry was appointed head coach of the team.\n\nThe only time France won an Olympic gold in soccer was in Los Angeles in 1984. Since 1992, men's soccer at the Olympics has been competed by each qualifying country's under-23 team - a span in which France has only qualified twice.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com",

The equestrian event will be cut after the Games following a scandal in Tokyo three years ago when a German coach struck a horse that wasn't cooperating with her athlete. Modern pentathlon is bringing in an \"American Ninja Warrior\"-style obstacle course for Los Angeles in 2028.

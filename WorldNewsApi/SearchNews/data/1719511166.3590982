The Ferrari star has been plagued by bad luck at his home race even before making his Formula 1 debut, missing out on two fantastic chances to win in 2021 and 2022. But after taking the all-important pole position at the Monte Carlo street circuit on Saturday, he lead from the front and was never really troubled by the McLaren of Oscar Piastri who finished second ahead of the other Ferrari of Carlos Sainz. It is Leclerc\u2019s first win since Austria 2022, the sixth of his F1 career and Ferrari\u2019s second of 2024 after Sainz\u2019s victory in Australia. The 26-year-old is the first ever Monegasque to win his home race and afterward emotions were running high, with Leclerc letting at a scream of joy and relief over the team radio before adding: \u2018Tonight is going to be a big night.\u2019 \u2018No words can explain that. It\u2019s such a difficult race, I think the fact twice I\u2019ve been starting on pole position and we couldn\u2019t quite make it makes it even better in a way,\u2019 he said afterward. \u2018It means a lot, obviously. It\u2019s the race which made me dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver one day.

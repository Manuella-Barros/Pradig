{"id": 227489580, "title": "These are the hottest remote entry-level gigs for the class of 2024", "text": "Gone are the days when you have to log years or decades at a company before they approve you for remote work flexibility. Now, that once hard-earned perk is expected straight out of the gate. In a recent survey from FlexJobs, 40% of Gen Z respondents stated that remote-work options were important to them, with 73% considering some kind of hybrid structure as their ideal setup. Adding fuel to the remote-work fire, 80% of the more than 7,000 overall survey respondents across Gen Zers, millennials and Gen Xers acknowledged that they\u2019re more productive in a remote work environment.FlexJobs \u2014 a career resources site and database specializing in remote and hybrid job listings \u2014 recently unveiled the Top 10 entry-level remote jobs for college graduates. Some of the highest paying entry-level jobs, based on average salary from Payscale, include software engineer ($93,346), data analyst ($67,302) and territory account executive ($63,617). Other openings are in customer service, as a business development representative, accountant, recruiter, administrative assistant, Spanish bilingual interpreter and sales representative. Toni Frana, manager of career experts for FlexJobs based in Niceville, Fla., is hopeful that 2024 grads will be able to secure their dream job despite the recent 2% dip in hiring projections for their class. \u201cWhile the job market remains competitive, there are a wide variety of remote and hybrid entry-level career opportunities across several industries for new grads,\u201d said Frana. \u201cWe have seen a decline in the number of fully remote jobs, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t exist,\u201d echoes Cassie Spencer, a New Hampshire career coach known as Career Coach Cassie, who also works as a co-coach with Eliana Goldstein Coaching of Brooklyn. \u201cExploring different companies, effectively networking and using a variety of job boards can lead to great success when looking for a remote or hybrid career,\u201d she said. While certain fields like customer service, accounting, finance and IT generally offer the most hybrid and remote opportunities, other arenas on this list may be more surprising. \u201cHowever, seeing the increase of remote and hybrid roles in business development and account management indicates that companies hiring for these roles are aware of the desire for young professionals to have flexibility in the way they work,\u201d said Frana. Spencer encourages job-seekers to pay attention to the technical skills associated with the positions and industries included in this list. \u201cComputer, IT, data and other more technical roles and industries are growing, but it also means that the skills required to obtain these jobs are also growing and changing,\u201d she said. If you have your heart set on not schlepping yourself to an office on a full-time basis, if at all, remember you can still find plenty of excellent job opportunities beyond the aforementioned arenas and specific job titles. Additionally, Spencer stressed that job titles are incredibly varied in the current job market and what one company calls a \u201ccustomer service\u201d role another company may call a \u201cclient relations manager\u201d or something completely different. \u201cResearching industry trends can help job-seekers determine which job titles are both most common and which align most with their skills and interests,\u201d said Spencer. All in all, Spencer believes that the FlexJobs findings regarding the top growing and most popular remote and hybrid careers reflect a similar growth that we\u2019ve seen in these fields over the past handful of years. Working with large numbers of soon-to-be and recent graduates, the job coach also urges job-seekers to use these lists as reference points and explore other industries, fields and roles that align with their interests, skills, experience and education. Want to land a plum remote gig? Here\u2019s how: Do your research \u201cIf working remotely or hybridly is a top priority, it\u2019s important to learn about the companies, not just the fields or jobs, that have a strong remote or hybrid culture,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cLearning about the companies that are \u2018remote first\u2019 or who have established hybrid or remote cultures is a great way to expand your job search outside of scrolling job boards.\u201d Step into the light In today\u2019s market, it\u2019s especially important for new grads to be visible to hiring professionals. \u201cThat means exercising their networking skills and building relationships with people who are doing the type of work they want to do \u2014 and with people who work at companies they\u2019d like to work for,\u201d said Frana. Connecting with professionals and asking for an informational chat can give new grads direction and advice from people doing the work they\u2019re seeking. \u201cThis can help shape their job-search activities, enabling them to be as strategic as possible, so they are able to secure a position soon after graduation,\u201d she said. Spencer believes networking will always be key to any job search, but especially for anyone seeking a remote opportunity. \u201cTalking with current employees can be a great way to both learn more about the remote or hybrid culture the company offers and to help move you along in the job search and interview process,\u201d said Frana. Customize your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or cover letter Young professionals should be sure to tailor their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and cover letter to every job posting. \u201cAs a new grad, it can be a good idea to highlight special projects or coursework you\u2019ve completed that would be relevant to the role,\u201d said Frana. \u201cThis helps highlight a skill set that matches a role even without traditional work experience.\u201d Get granular One of the biggest interviewing mistakes Spencer sees is candidates talking about their experiences too broadly. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide specific examples and to tell stories that showcase the skills and experiences that you have,\u201d she said. \u201cI often work with soon-to-be and recent grads who discredit the work that they\u2019ve done. Own the experience that you have.\u201d Be patient Whatever you do, don\u2019t be hard on yourself if you don\u2019t secure a job offer fresh out of your cap and gown. Frana emphasizes that it takes time to land a job as a new grad.", "summary": "Want to land a plum remote gig?

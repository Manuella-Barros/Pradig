The current main event for the event is Conor McGregor vs Michael Chandler, but Do Bronx has put the company on notice that he's ready to step in if needed. Notorious has since reacted to Oliveira's offer on Twitter, welcoming his challenge.\n\nFormer UFC lightweight champion Charles Oliveira has become a household name in the MMA world and continues to prove why he is such a fan-favorite fighter as he threw his hat in the cage to serve as a potential backup for UFC 303's main event between Conor McGregor and Michael Chandler.\n\nThough McGregor and Chandler have been reliable throughout their careers in terms of showing up to fight, Oliveira volunteering as an option \"b\" for the company, shows his restlessness to keep active.\n\nAccording to a Full Send MMA post, Oliveira, a big-framed lightweight, is ready to fight at welterweight for the first time since his professional fighting debut back in 2008. The post also states that if he were to step in and fight the Irishman - as opposed to Chandler - he would request more money.\n\nCharles Oliveira is one of the Greatest Lightweights MMA Record: 34-10 (10 KOs, 21 SUBs), UFC Wins: 22, Best Win: Dustin Poirier\n\nBefore \"Do Bronx\" hit his stride in the lightweight division by rattling off 11 straight victories, along with collecting title belts, he was a middle of the pack fighter who couldn't find consistency. Oliveira was struggling to find a home as he bounced up and down weight classes, missing weight several times along the way. Before his amazing win-streak, Oliveira was clinging to an average record of 10-8.\n\nWhen the switch finally did turn on for the Brazilian, it was lights out for the rest of the division. His run was so impressive due to the fact that he finished all 11 opponents. During the finish streak, he was able to pass legendary UFC 1 champion Royce Gracie for the most submission wins in UFC history. Fans really appreciate Oliveira's insanely entertaining style, but also his humble aura that transcends language barriers.\n\nUFC 300 to UFC 303? A McGregor event brings more eyeballs and financial opportunities\n\nThe last time we saw the former UFC lightweight king was just a few weeks back at UFC 300. Oliveira was taking on tough up-and-coming contender Arman Tsarukyan, who trained for and survived all the Brazilian jiu-jitsu ace's dangerous submission attempts. Tsarukyan is right in line for a title fight, so Oliveira's loss is forgivable, but the former champ is ready to register a win upon his return to the Octagon.\n\nUFC 303 could be a platform for UFC 300 losers Jamahal Hill and Oliveira to rebound from their losses. Hill has signed on to face Khalil Rountree and \"Do Bronx'' is hoping to go from an alternate fighter to fighting on one of the biggest cards of the year.\n\nRelated Conor McGregor Unleashes on Ryan Garcia in Savage Tweet UFC fighter Conor McGregor has not held back with his thoughts on Ryan Garcia following his failed drugs test after beating Devin Haney.\n\nThe McGregor and Chandler fight was announced by Dana White at the UFC 300 post-fight press conference with the bout scheduled to happen at 170 pounds. The weight change for Oliveira may serve him well as he's 34 years old and is already very big at 155 pounds. Hopefully the original main event remains intact, but Oliveira is ready to go if needed.\n\nConor McGregor Reacts to Charles Oliveira's Proposition\n\nFollowing the news that Oliveira was willing and able to step in should anything happen to the current plans, McGregor took to X to respond, and he did so in traditional McGregor fashion.\n\n\"I do yous both in the same night, no sweat. I do yous both inside of a round. Combined. I got the magic paws ask Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo about me and my magic.

beat during his rise through the ranks in 2013.\n\nAnother loss could spell the end of McGregor's career fighting world-class MMA fighters, but retirement is unlikely as he claims to be feeling as fresh as ever.\n\n\"I'm barely touched,\" said on This Life of Mine with James Corden.\n\n\"I only got clipped once and then the leg break, that's it.\n\n\"I've put more people to sleep than

UFC legend slams Michael Chandler as he makes shock Conor McGregor prediction", "body": "Almost every pundit in MMA is picking Michael Chandler to beat Conor McGregor when the pair fight at UFC 303 next month.\n\nBut one former welterweight title contender isn't so sure after watching the American sit on the sidelines for two years in the hopes of landing his biggest career payday. Chandler last competed in a losing effort to Dustin Poirier in November of 2022, and has since been idle as he awaits McGregor's return.\n\nLuckily, that tactic has worked out and he will face the Irishman on June 29 as the headliner of International Fight Week. But while many believe he is a big favourite, one top analyst isn't so sure about Chandler's top level credentials.\n\nFormer UFC welterweight title challenger Dan Hardy is one of the most respected minds in MMA today after switching from the cage to a role as analyst. And he appears to be one of the few backing McGregor to roll back the years and last his first victory since January of 2020.\n\nSpeaking on The MMA Hour, Hardly explained how he feels Chandler is too reckless for an athlete with the fight IQ of McGregor. He also noted that the reasons the former Bellator champion is doing the fight may not be right when it comes to preparation.\n\n\"Michael Chandler is not the guy that he was in Bellator,\" Hardy said. \"He was cautious and he was picking his shots.\n\n\"If he plays the game that he did against, say, Sidney Outlaw where he was poised and ready and waiting to land that clean shot then that Chandler can beat anybody with that speed off the mark and that power.\n\n\"But he has become a lot more reckless recently and that just plays into Conor McGregor's game. McGregor made Jose Aldo reckless and then punished him for it.\n\n\"Chandler comes in reckless, he's coming in for a payday and a show. He's not thinking 'right, I'm going to beat Conor McGregor and I'm going to do it this particular way'. He's coming to fight.\"\n\nExcitement continues to build for the big fight between Chandler and McGregor, with the UFC finally releasing their first teaser for the event during Saturday's UFC 301 broadcast. The preview garnered millions of views online, although many fans noticed one key detail.\n\nThe preview video shows McGregor's silhouette pacing around a room lit up in green. In the background, his infamous walkout song The Foggy Dew by Sinead O'Connor plays.\n\nBut fans on social media were in hysterics when they notice that at no point does Chandler feature in this important advertisement.\n\nThe top two comments on the UFC's YouTube upload garnered over 6,000 likes between them and read \"They didn't even put Michael Chandler in the trailer\" and \"Dawg they said we dont even need Michael whats his name for the promo.\"\n\nChandler has been relentless in his pursuit of the fight, and made regular promotional appearances since the bout was announced in February of last year. He even coached against McGregor on The Ultimate Fighter last season.\n\nBut the Irishman did briefly eye up some other fights, calling out the likes of Nate Diaz and Justin Gaethje throughout the last few years.

Oliveira earned himself a unanimous decision victory, handing Ferguson his second-straight loss.\n\nSince then, Tony Ferguson has grown his losing streak to near-record-breaking seven-straight defeats. Following his latest loss to Paddy Pimblett at UFC 296, fans, pundits, and even UFC CEO Dana White called for 'El Cucuy' to lay down his gloves for good.\n\nUnfortunately, Ferguson has failed to take the advice of his peers, remaining convinced that he can turn things around and get back to the version of himself that once rattled off 12 straight wins in what was the most talent-rich division at the time.\n\nAs for Charles Oliveira, 'Do Bronx' is fresh off a split decision loss to Arman Tsarukyan at UFC 300 last month. With the loss, Oliveira will move back down the lightweight ladder, paving the way for Dustin Poirier to step up and accept a fight with the division's top dog, Islam Makhachev.\n\nStill, Oliveira is sitting as the No. 2 ranked contender in the division, meaning one big win could put him right back into the title picture. However, 'Do Bronx' recently suggested that a move up to welterweight could be in his future.", "source": {"uri": "lowkickmma.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LowKickMMA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "craig_pekios@lowkickmma.com", "name": "Craig Pekios", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Oliveira", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles Oliveira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_Fight_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UFC Fight Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Kickboxing_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Kickboxing Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Pimblett", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paddy Pimblett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_256", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UFC 256"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arman_Tsarukyan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arman Tsarukyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_Makhachev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam Makhachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Split decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Poirier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Poirier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.lowkickmma.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MixCollage-03-May-2024-06-28-PM-1152.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536937", "eventUri": "eng-9536937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 519, "textEnd": 525}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 735, "textEnd": 748}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

He faces Bobby King in a Lightweight bout at the 3Arena.\n\nThe Lavey native was a world champion with Cage Warriors, and has become an inspirational figure for young MMA stars coming through the ranks.\n\nBut who inspires Hughes?\n\n\"One name comes to mind is Michael Chandler,\" Hughes told Belfast Live.\n\n\"I was just talking about him in another interview. He is someone I have trained with when I am in Kill Cliff. He is obviously fighting Conor McGregor soon.\n\n\"The reason I pick him is nothing to do with fighting, it is because of how nice of a guy he is. And people like that inspire me, because that's what I want to be. I want people saying 'he's not a bad lad'. You can have all the success, but treat people the right way.\n\n\"Those are the types of people I look up to the most. You can be the best and also be a nice person. There is a life to live, and a lot of hours outside of fighting.\"\n\nThe bookmakers can't separate Chandler and McGregor for their fight, with Paddy Power offering odds of 9/10 on both men.\n\nHughes believes the contest is too close to call, and thinks both men have solid claims to be favourite.\n\nHe added: \"It is a hard one. I think if Chandler can implement his wrestling he has a good chance. He did it against Dustin Poirier and won two of the rounds before getting stopped in the third.\n\n\"But if Conor can keep it on the feet I think it will probably go his way. I can't see Conor returning to the level he was when he was champ-champ, I just think that's a natural thing because he is older.\n\n\"He was in his prime then, but he can improve in other ways for this fight.\"\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors":

Gamrot? Naaaaaah", "body": "Just a few weeks ago at UFC 300, former Lightweight champion Charles Oliveira suffered a competitive split-decision loss to fast-rising contender Arman Tsarukyan. It was a close fight against a great opponent, but it's also the first time \"Do Bronx\" has lost a non-title fight since December 2017.\n\nBecause of the defeat, Oliveira has now lost two of his last three. The Brazilian wants to return to action quickly and get back in the win column, and he's teased a possible jump to Welterweight in pursuit of high-profile fights. He wants a summer return, and recently, Mateusz Gamrot offered to be his next dance partner.\n\nOliveira isn't all that interested.\n\nWhen asked about fighting Gamrot, Oliveira responded, \"Man, to be honest, he deserves all the respect. He is doing a great job. With all respect, I'm not looking behind, just forward ... Everyone now wants to face Charles, everybody wants to fight whoever is up front. It's part of it, let it happen. We have to always be ready, but I don't think so. We have to think properly and see what would work out. It might be that forward, yes, but right now I think it's not what the moment is.\"\n\nIn other words: thanks, but no thanks.\n\nAt the moment, Gamrot is ranked No. 5 at 155-pounds, meaning turning him away would still be a significant win for the former champion that helps get him closer to a title shot. However, he's far from the biggest name in the Lightweight division. If Oliveira is motivated by scoring big fights more than anything else, it makes sense why he would want to weigh his options before committing to \"Gamer\" as his return.\n\nJuly and August aren't too far off, so expect \"Do Bronx\" to receive an opponent sooner than later.\n\nI like the idea of One Championship's hydration testing, but the amount of title fights disrupted by the scale is disappointing.\n\nFeatherweight b-b-b-banger alert!\n\nIs virtual competition the real future of combat sports?

What Chandler aspires is to cause one of the biggest upsets in recent history. 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor is returning to the ring after a three-year hiatus, that too with a plum and Chandler just wants to rain all over his parade.\n\nMichael Chandler is looking to derail the Conor McGregor hype train. He recently posted a workout video on Instagram where he drew inspiration from a Joe Rogan quote,\n\n\"#walkonwisdom via @joerogan - what if life and our \"problems\" are not as complicated as they have to be? Maybe the majority of what ails us is just a priority issue?\"\n\nJoe Rogan himself has been a martial artist all his life and in the midst of all those controversies, does drop gems of his wisdom during his podcasts. And it appears Chandler has had his ear to the wall all this time.\n\nAnd of course, Chandler needs it. Chandler will need any kind of motivation he can get for his next fight with Conor McGregor. Even though both fighters are looking for a win after having just one in their last 4 fights.\n\nTalking about losses, Chandler recently spoke about what the mindset of a fighter is after not winning for a long time. He spoke about going two years without a win and what it does to him mentally.\n\nMichael Chandler went from being a Bellator Lightweight World Champion to struggling to find his feet in the UFC. The transition was not as smooth as he expected it to be.\n\nAt Bellator, he was a force to be reckoned with, becoming a three-time Bellator Champion. However, after getting into the UFC, his fate changed as he could not string any wins together. In an interview with Shawn Ryan on YouTube, he spoke about an athlete's mindset.\n\nDan Abrahams posted a clip from the interview on YouTube where he stated,\n\n\"Almost two full years without winning a fight and that for a Mixed Martial Artist could be a career death sentence. That's when the doubt from everybody plus yourself continues to compound on itself.\"\n\nMichael Chandler struggled with losses early in his Bellator days as well. However, he was able to bounce back from it after hiring a sports psychologist.\n\nChandler maintained the importance of a strong mindset, stating it is as important as building up your body. He claims, without a strong mind, a strong body will do no good.\n\nHe will look to replicate his success in the UFC, and a win against Conor McGregor would do just that.

The former double champ rolled out an epic birthday bash for his 7-year-old son, gifting him a Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan jersey to celebrate the youngster's birthday with his close ones.\n\nTaking things to his Instagram account, the fighter-turned-millionaire shared a thread of wholesome pictures of his son having a ball with his friends and family. The kiddo was seen playing a game of basketball with his buddies against his friends who were seen in Lebron James Jersey.\n\n\"Best 7 years of my time on this earth, thank you God, thank you Mammy, thank you my son @conormcgregorjr you are the coolest kid I've ever known, I absolutely love you my boy! Happy 7th birthday my son, Daddy loves ya.\"\n\nMcGregor and his better half, Dee Devlin welcomed their first child, Conor Jr on May 6, 2017, at 8 p.m. in Dublin's Coombe Maternity Hospital. The fighter was ecstatic, sharing the good news to his ardent followers with a witty caption and a few pictures back then, and now the family has grown further.\n\nNow 'The Notorious' has four lovely children with his long-time girlfriend and fiancee, Devlin. While Conor Jr is the couple's first-born, the duo welcomed their second child, Cora in 2019. Following the birth of his first daughter, the couple expanded their family further welcoming two more sons - Rian and Mack in 2021 and 2023 respectively.\n\nIn fact, 2024 is turning out to be a massive year for the fighter with him investing huge sums in the bare-knuckle promotion as a stakeholder. All the while, fight fans are on their heels waiting for his grand return to the octagon.\n\nIn a 5-round banger, he is slated to take on 'Iron' Michael Chandler in a welterweight bout scheduled in July at UFC 303. Hyping up the event and upping the stakes, UFC partnered up with ESPN to dish out a stellar promo video, that has the fandom weak on its knees.\n\nIt has been over three long years since the MMA community last saw Conor McGregor inside the octagon. Though his last fight against Dustin Poirier did not go the way anyone expected it to go, the presence of the former double champ brought in massive numbers.\n\nNow with UFC 303 just 2 months away, the hype is through the roof for the main event. The animosity between TUF coaches, McGregor and Chandler certainly has got fans pumped. Adding fuel to the fire is ESPN's new promo video that just dropped in yesterday. The 25-second short clip is nothing but the start of a promotional campaign and the first of the lot certainly has hit the mark with fans going wild of \"The Return.\"\n\nConor McGregor returns to the octagon on 30 June 2024.

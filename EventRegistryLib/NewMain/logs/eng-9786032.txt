Only 12 other economies are labeled as non-market by Washington, including China, Russia, North Korea and Azerbaijan.\n\nA change in status has been opposed by U.S. steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and honey farmers and members of the U.S. Congress representing them, but backed by retailers and some other business groups.\n\n\"Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its determination that Vietnam will continue to be classified as a non-market economy country for purposes of calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam,\" the department said in a statement after a year-long review.\n\n\"This finding means that the methodology used in calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam remains the same,\" it said.\n\nVietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade said upgrading Vietnam would have been an objective and fair move.\n\n\"Vietnam regrets that despite several positive improvements in the Vietnamese economy recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce still has not recognised Vietnam as a market economy country,\" it said in a statement.\n\nVietnam has long argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, and it has said that retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nOpponents of an upgrade have countered that Hanoi's policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it operates as a planned economy governed by the ruling Communist Party. They say Vietnam is increasingly being used as a manufacturing hub by Chinese firms to circumvent US curbs on imports from China.\n\nA 284-page Commerce memo explaining the decision said it was taken despite Vietnam's \"impressive reforms and economic growth.\"\n\nBlow to closer ties\n\nWashington has worked hard to foster closer ties with Vietnam in the face of growing strategic competition with China and the issue of whether to upgrade Vietnam has been awkward given the approaching US election in November and claims by each side that they stand for worker rights.\n\nSome analysts said before the announcement a failure to upgrade Vietnam could be negative for US-Vietnam relations.\n\n\"Vietnamese leaders have seen this decision as an important benchmark in their improving relationship with the US and the achievement of normalisation between the two countries,\" said Edmund Malesky, a professor of political economy and director of the Duke Center for International Development.\n\nMurray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the decision \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"Vietnam's market is as free as many others not on the NME list,\" he said, adding that the decision seemed \"out of whack\" with U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, when the two sides elevated ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also promoted Vietnam as a \"friend-shoring\" destination to shift US supply chains away from China.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy, said that even if the Biden administration were to have taken the politically risky step of upgrading Vietnam, it would have been a pyrrhic victory given that any future Trump administration was certain to reverse it.\n\nNazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said the decision reflected \"ample\" evidence from industry groups \"that Vietnam's economy has not transformed to the extent that would warrant treatment as a market economy\".\n\n\"Ignoring distortions in the economies of trading partners is unfair and prejudicial against American interests,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Despite economic reforms, opposition from U.S. industries and political considerations led to the decision, impacting U.S.-Vietnam relations amid rising strategic competition with China.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department announced on Friday it will continue to classify Vietnam as a non-market economy country, a decision disappointing to Hanoi, which the U.S. has been wooing in its efforts to push back against China. Vietnam has long sought an upgrade, which would have reduced the punitive anti-dumping duties levied on non-market economies marked by heavy state influence. Only 12 other economies are labeled as non-market by Washington, including China, Russia, North Korea, and Azerbaijan.\n\nA change in status has been opposed by U.S. steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers, honey farmers, and members of the U.S. Congress representing them but backed by retailers and other business groups. 'Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its determination that Vietnam will continue to be classified as a non-market economy country for purposes of calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam,' the department said in a statement after a year-long review.\n\n'This finding means that the methodology used in calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam remains the same,' it said. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade said upgrading Vietnam would have been an objective and fair move.\n\n'Vietnam regrets that despite several positive improvements in the Vietnamese economy recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce still has not recognized Vietnam as a market economy country,' it said in a statement. Vietnam has long argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, and it has said that retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China.\n\nOpponents of an upgrade have countered that Hanoi's policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it operates as a planned economy governed by the ruling Communist Party. They say Vietnam is increasingly being used as a manufacturing hub by Chinese firms to circumvent U.S. curbs on imports from China. A 284-page Commerce memo explaining the decision said it was taken despite Vietnam's 'impressive reforms and economic growth.'\n\nWashington has worked hard to foster closer ties with Vietnam in the face of growing strategic competition with China, and the issue of whether to upgrade Vietnam has been awkward given the approaching U.S. election in November and claims by each side that they stand for worker rights.\n\nSome analysts said before the announcement that a failure to upgrade Vietnam could be negative for U.S.-Vietnam relations. 'Vietnamese leaders have seen this decision as an important benchmark in their improving relationship with the U.S. and the achievement of normalization between the two countries,' said Edmund Malesky, a professor of political economy and director of the Duke Center for International Development.\n\nMurray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the decision 'ridiculous.' 'Vietnam's market is as free as many others not on the NME list,' he said, adding that the decision seemed 'out of whack' with U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, when the two sides elevated ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also promoted Vietnam as a 'friend-shoring' destination to shift U.S. supply chains away from China. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy, said that even if the Biden administration had taken the politically risky step of upgrading Vietnam, it would have been a pyrrhic victory given that any future Trump administration was certain to reverse it.\n\nNazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said the decision reflected 'ample' evidence from industry groups 'that Vietnam's economy has not transformed to the extent that would warrant treatment as a market economy.' 'Ignoring distortions in the economies of trading partners is unfair and prejudicial against American interests,' she said.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The EU also designates Vietnam as a non-market economy.\n\nBut as Vietnam has emerged as a critical link in the global manufacturing supply chain for western companies seeking to diversify their operations away from China, it has increased its efforts to be upgraded.\n\nIn a September 2023 request filed to the US commerce department, Vietnam asked Washington to reconsider its status, citing \"economic reforms made in recent years\".\n\nThe US commerce department said on Friday that the decision to retain Vietnam's non-market economy status had been made after a thorough evaluation of comments from US domestic industries and the Vietnamese government.\n\n\"Despite Vietnam's substantive reforms made over the past 20 years, the extensive government involvement in Vietnam's economy distorts Vietnamese prices and costs,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nVietnam has emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with companies shifting production facilities to the south-east Asian country in an effort to avoid geopolitical disruption.\n\nVietnam has also strengthened its relationship with the US, a realignment that it has sought to leverage to pursue market economy status. Its request to the commerce department came just days before a visit by President Joe Biden, during which the two countries upgraded their ties to a \"comprehensive strategic partnership\", the highest level of diplomatic ties accorded by Hanoi.\n\nSenior Vietnamese officials, including the prime minister, have also made the request. Nguyen Quoc Dzung, Vietnam's ambassador to the US, said earlier this year that if Washington did not grant the country market economy status, \"it would be very, very bad for the two countries\".\n\nVietnam's push, however, ran into opposition from some US senators, steelmakers and other manufacturers, as well as producers of shrimp and honey over what they call unfair trade practices and extensive government intervention.\n\nIn July, Republican senator Tom Cotton urged commerce secretary Gina Raimondo not to grant Vietnam's request, citing its \"controlled currency, lack of labour rights, and extensive state intervention\". Six other Republican senators co-signed the letter.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the country's non-market economic practices already violate fair competition and lawful trade,\" the senators wrote.\n\nEarlier this year, another group of senators including Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also opposed the market economy status, citing more than two dozen anti-dumping orders against Vietnam by the US and pending dumping investigations.\n\nThuy Anh Nguyen, of Vietnam-focused asset manager Dragon Capital, said the failure would disappoint Hanoi, and was surprising given Washington's \"intense courtship of Vietnam in recent years, the high-level visits and the accompanying rhetoric\".\n\nAn upgrade would have boosted Vietnamese exports to the US, which would have benefited from lower prices of those goods, she said.\n\n\"The US has made no secret of its desire to cultivate Vietnam as a strategic counterbalance to China's influence in the region, and we do not believe that Vietnam not being upgraded to 'market economy' status will affect this.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Although recognising many positive changes in the Vietnamese economy in recent times, this decision does not fully reflect Vietnam's great efforts and achievements in building and developing a market economy, which have been recognised by the international community,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the spokeswoman, in recent times, Vietnamese agencies and businesses have actively coordinated with the US Department of Commerce to provide many convincing arguments affirming that Vietnam's economy has fully met six market economy criteria in line with the US law. This has also been supported by many US and international associations, businesses, and experts. In fact, to date, 72 countries have recognised Vietnam as having a market economy. International organisations have recognised the remarkable progress of the Vietnamese economy. At the same time, Vietnam has participated in many high-quality Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).\n\n\"In the spirit of comprehensive strategic partnership, Vietnam requests the US to continue implementing its commitment to broad, strong and constructive coordination and to soon recognise the market economy status of Vietnam.

China and Russia are among the other countries on Washington\u2019s list.\n\nLast year, Vietnam officially requested the removal of the designation \u2013 which has been in place since 2002 \u2013 right before US President Joe Biden\u2019s visit to Hanoi in September.\n\n\u201cDespite Vietnam\u2019s substantive reforms made over the past 20 years, the extensive government involvement in Vietnam\u2019s economy distorts Vietnamese prices and costs and ultimately render them unusable for the purpose of calculating US anti-dumping duties,\u201d the US Commerce Department said.\n\nThe department added that it would continue to use market-based prices and costs of similar goods from a country at a comparable level of economic development as Vietnam to calculate anti-dumping duties.\n\nIn response, the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade expressed its regret that the US has yet to recognise its market economy status although Washington has acknowledged positive changes in its economy in recent years.\n\nThe ministry said the decision meant that \u201cVietnamese businesses exporting goods to the US market will continue to face discrimination in US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations.\u201d\n\nIt noted that 72 countries recognise Vietnam as a market economy, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea.\n\nIt has also enforced 17 free trade agreements with Britain, the European Union and countries in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, with commitments on tax cuts, labour standards, environmental protection, sustainable development, government procurement and transparency.\n\nThe International Trade Administration, a division of the Commerce Department, said that the US is now Vietnam\u2019s largest export market and a major source of foreign direct investment. Vietnam\u2019s export revenue to the US jumped 230 per cent over the past five years, while its import value grew by more than 175 per cent.\n\nNazak Nikakhtar, a partner at Wiley Rein, said the department took a key step to \u201clevel the playing field and deliver an important win for dozens of American industries and their workers, who have been forced to compete with the unfair trade practices of Vietnamese companies\u201d.\n\n\u201cIgnoring distortions in the economies of trading partners is unfair and prejudicial to American interests,\u201d Nikakhtar, an assistant commerce secretary during the Donald Trump administration, said.\n\nLiang Yan, an economist at Willamette University in the US state of Oregon, called the decision \u201ckind of surprising\u201d because Washington has hoped to build supply chains outside China \u2013 with Vietnam a likely alternative.\n\n\u201cVietnam is one of the prime candidates, so I\u2019d think they\u2019d want to help its supply chains there,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, she said, the US is wary of China using Vietnam for transshipments and would \u201cwant to prepare themselves for a bit more leeway as more Chinese companies are going to try to shift to Vietnam\u201d to avoid US tariffs.\n\nYun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre think tank, said she thought \u201cthe perception [in Washington] is that Vietnam has not done enough to justify a change in the policy\u201d.\n\nMoreover, she noted, the Biden administration faces \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d to prove its record on foreign policy in an election year, she said \u2013 especially when Vice-President Kamala Harris is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn addition to labour and human rights issues in Vietnam, she said that US officials were concerned about \u201cChina using Vietnam as a back door into the US market\u201d.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China

Supply: Commerce Protection Advisory Council - VCCI\n\n\"If the US Division of Commerce had reviewed the information and practices in Vietnam objectively and pretty, it might have acknowledged the

anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties, will make buying and selling in items and providers simpler and items cheaper.\n\nCommerce turnover between the 2 nations is anticipated to extend many occasions

The U.S. Department of Commerce concluded that it would not lift Vietnam's NME status because the Vietnamese government still heavily intervenes in the economy despite its recent economic reforms. Some U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed support for Commerce's decision on the grounds that Hanoi still lacks labor rights and manipulates its currency. The verdict means that Vietnam, along with U.S. competitors Russia and China, will face higher tariffs on Vietnamese exports compared to states with a market economy status.\n\nThe verdict also marks the first significant setback of the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), as Vietnam had been lobbying and reaching out to U.S. officials directly to have their country's NME status lifted. Importantly, it directly undermines one of the pillars of the CSP, under which Vietnam and the United States pledged to expand economic ties, of which Vietnam's market economy status is a vital element, and downplay the security aspect to avoid antagonizing China.\n\nThe Vietnamese government voiced its regret at the verdict, stating that \"despite several positive improvements in the Vietnamese economy recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce still has not recognized Vietnam as a market economy country.\" From the Vietnamese government perspective, an upgrade would have been \"objective and fair\" considering Vietnam's many free trade agreements, the fact that its market economy status has been recognized by U.S. allies such as Japan and Australia, and its participation in the U.S.-led Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Vietnam was already disappointed with the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017.\n\nPutting aside the economic aspects of the verdict, the U.S. decision is poised to have significant repercussions on U.S.-Vietnam security cooperation. Economics and security are deeply intertwined due to their mutually reinforcing nature. An economically strong state will have more resources to spend on defense, which ultimately will ensure a peaceful geopolitical environment for economic development. The United States knows this lesson best: during the Cold War, it tolerated Japanese and South Korean protectionism in order to ensure that they would grow militarily capable. The United States ignored those countries' heavy-handed interventions into the economy as well as their poor labor rights and even resisted protectionist demands from U.S. interest groups to serve its security objective of keeping Japan and South Korea away from the communist bloc. The United States lost in economic terms, but in terms of political and military terms, its gains were tremendous. Economic cooperation is rarely just about economics but about the political signal of U.S. commitment to its allies and partners.\n\nAlthough U.S.-Vietnam relations have not yet reached the level of an alliance, U.S. policy toward Vietnam is not much different in terms of logic. First, the United States wants to build a resilient Vietnam, one that is economically viable and militarily strong enough to balance against China. Second, the United States sees Vietnam as a way of \"friend-shoring\" vital supply chains away from China. Both objectives serve one coherent goal: to contain the rise of China. It is not a coincidence that the United States has so far tolerated a $114 billion trade deficit with Vietnam while it is looking to increase tariffs and restrictions on Chinese companies to prepare itself for a possible war with China.\n\nHowever, unlike the U.S. determination to sideline protectionist demands from its constituents during the Cold War, the U.S. failure to curb these demands this time is hurting its Vietnam policy. Growing economic inequality, in which domestic \"losers\" have not been properly compensated by the \"winners\" for their losses of jobs and incomes due to free trade agreements, mean that U.S. lawmakers would bend to their constituents' isolationist pressure to say no to free trade agreements purely on economic terms, even if those free trade agreements matter to improving the U.S. ability to politically influence allies and partners.\n\nIn other words, U.S. domestic polarization as a result of income inequality is hindering the U.S. power to convince its allies and partners of its ability to lead. In addition to populism, parochial interests, such as the U.S. catfish industry or steel industry, do not see U.S.-Vietnam ties from a security perspective but from a purely business profit perspective. And that explains why despite tolerating massive trade deficits with Hanoi, the United States cannot lift its NME status. The United States cannot put aside short-term interests in service of a long-term goal, which is to support a resilient Vietnam.\n\nThe United States also cannot gather enough domestic support for a coherent political purpose vis-\u00e0-vis Vietnam because Hanoi is still a communist country, unlike Japan and South Korea. Ideological differences continue playing a major role in limiting the growth of U.S.-Vietnam ties, despite Washington's repeated assurances that it would not overthrow Vietnam's communist regime. U.S. lawmakers representing the anti-communist Vietnamese American community have emphasized the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record in opposing market economy status for Hanoi. This opposition is born not of humanistic ideals but from electoral calculations, since the United States has shown that it does not care about human rights when itself violating those rights or tolerating allied violations is in its national interests.\n\nVietnam also has legitimate reasons to suspect that the U.S. is still harboring bad intentions toward communist countries, as Vietnam, despite the friendly relationship with the United States, is still classified alongside the likes of Russia and China. From the Vietnamese perspective, U.S. actions do not match its words. A day after he was elected as the new CPV general secretary, To Lam warned that Vietnam would have to stay vigilant about hostile forces' growingly sophisticated efforts to sabotage the CPV from within by exploiting Vietnam's international integration.\n\nThe failure to lift the NME status will also deprive the United States and Vietnam of opportunities to add substance to the CSP, which has been lacking so far. Vietnam has not made any major arms purchases from the United States since the lifting of the lethal arms embargo in 2016 due to the high cost of U.S weapons. Opening more of the U.S. market to Vietnamese exports would first and foremost give Vietnam more resources to buy U.S. arms and open more venues for military exchanges. The United States will have a bigger say in Vietnam's defense strategy if Vietnam procures U.S. arms.\n\nSecond, expanding U.S.-Vietnam economic cooperation would make Vietnam conceptualize its national interests on more U.S.-friendly terms. Vietnamese businesses and policymakers with vested interests in U.S.-Vietnam trade will be more likely to advocate for a more U.S.-leaning policy when they have the numbers to show for it. Finally, while the United States cannot replace China as Vietnam's most important trading partner, an increase in exports from Vietnam would help the communist government maintain domestic stability thanks to continued economic growth and confirm the U.S. commitment to a politically stable Vietnam. This is a strategy that China has been enacting, and the United States should follow the Chinese playbook.\n\nAll is not yet lost in U.S.-Vietnam relations, and this will be an occasion for the United States and Vietnam to reevaluate the country's importance in the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. The negative optics of Secretary of State Antony Blinken missing Trong's funeral have not been lost on Vietnamese audiences, because it shows where U.S. priorities truly lie. Vietnam will not trust a U.S. security commitment because the United States is not a continental Asian power. However, the United States can and should demonstrate to Vietnam that it can put aside parochial interests to bring about a substantial relationship and build toward a truly mutual respect partnership. And that starts with treating Vietnam as not just another communist country.", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

hit show 'Game of Thrones' appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. -- Reuters picLOS ANGELES, Aug 13 -- Sony. Netflix. And now, HBO.\n\nWhile the 2014 hacking at Sony Pictures pushed entertainment giants to take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain. Last week, as HBO investigated a cyberattack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show Game of Thrones appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix Inc's Orange Is the New Black leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nCybercrime is a growing problem for many industries, but Hollywood is especially vulnerable because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognise this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal email accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ballers, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's emails and a summary of an unaired episode of Game of Thrones, according to Variety.\n\nAfter receiving a ransom demand, an HBO executive emailed the hacker on July 27 offering US$250,000 (RM1.07 million) as payment for finding a security flaw, according to a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg. HBO asked the hacker to extend the deadline for a week while the company arranged a payment in bitcoin. That was a stalling effort, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Variety reported on the email earlier.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire email system, Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner Inc, declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theatres loses 19 per cent of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favourite shows and movies online for free.\n\nRansom demands\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: Should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back?\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea.\n\n\"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of Orange Is the New Black. Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about US$50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new Pirates of the Caribbean if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like Game of Thrones and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for The Interview, a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\" -- Bloomberg", "timeCrawl": "01:58:00", "sim": 0.9725490212440491, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 221, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 227}, {"textStart": 2362, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2369}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8862144", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Netflix. And now, HBO.\n\nWhile the 2014 hacking at Sony Pictures pushed entertainment giants to take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain. Last week, as HBO investigated a cyberattack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show \"Game of Thrones\" appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix's \"Orange Is the New Black\" leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nCybercrime is a growing problem for many industries, but Hollywood is especially vulnerable because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognize this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal email accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Ballers,\" a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's emails and a summary of an unaired episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" according to Variety.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire email system, Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner Inc., declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theaters loses 19 percent of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favorite shows and movies online for free.\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: Should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back? The HBO hackers released an email from an HBO executive last week showing a willingness to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000.\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea.\n\n\"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about $50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high-profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary \u00adDavis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like 'Game of Thrones' and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for \"The Interview,\" a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\"\n\n17935913", "timeCrawl": "07:34:00", "sim": 0.9686274528503418, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8885398", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHackers this week released an email from HBO in which the company expressed willingness to pay them $250,000 as part of a negotiation over data swiped from HBO's servers.\n\nThe July 27 email was sent by John Beyler, an HBO executive who thanked the hackers for \"making us aware\" of previously unknown security vulnerabilities. The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation. The same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nHOW BAD IS THE HACK?\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data and whether HBO's reaction might encourage future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nA ROUGH CHRONOLOGY\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Beyler's email, sent several days earlier, might have been an attempt to make the problem go away without too much bad publicity for HBO, said Sanjay Goel, a professor at the University at Albany and chairman of its information technology management department.\n\n\"Hackers are not in this game for $250,000; this probably took them a lot of time and effort,\" Goel said. \"That's a very, very small amount in these kinds of negotiations.\"\n\nThen, on Monday, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from \"Game of Thrones\" episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHOLLYWOOD IN THE CROSSHAIRS\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ahead of their official launch date.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"", "timeCrawl": "03:44:00", "sim": 0.9647058844566345, "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 11, "date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 4}, {"textStart": 2070, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2077}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8739263", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain. Last week, as HBO investigated a cyberattack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show Game of Thrones appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix Inc.'s Orange Is the New Black leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nCybercrime is a growing problem for many industries, but Hollywood is especially vulnerable because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognize this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal email accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ballers, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's emails and a summary of an unaired episode of Game of Thrones, according to Variety.\n\nAfter receiving a ransom demand, an HBO executive emailed the hacker on 27 July offering $250,000 as payment for finding a security flaw, according to a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg. HBO asked the hacker to extend the deadline for a week while the company arranged a payment in bitcoin. That was a stalling effort, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Variety reported on the email earlier.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire email system, chief executive officer Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner Inc., declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theaters loses 19% of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favourite shows and movies online for free.\n\nRansom demands\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: Should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back?\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea. \"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of Orange Is the New Black. Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about $50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new Pirates of the Caribbean if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and chief executive officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like Game of Thrones and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for The Interview, a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\" Bloomberg", "timeCrawl": "08:13:00", "sim": 0.95686274766922, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2102, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2109}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8762913", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

There is still the possibility that it may have been doctored or altered.)\n\nREAD MORE: HBO hack: 'Game of Thrones' hackers leak cast's phone numbers and addresses\n\nThe hackers leaked a screenshot of the email, dated July 27, which shows a senior VP at HBO offering the money and attempting negotiation. While some critics of the email are pointing to its vague language, Variety reports that it's purposefully cryptic in an effort to make it seem less like a payoff and more like a reward.\n\nUnfortunately, Global News couldn't secure its own image of the email, but most sources are reporting that it takes a non-confrontational tone, and opens the negotiation to stop the leaks of valuable information. The Hollywood Reporter acquired the email, quoting this segment:\n\n\"[HBO has] been working hard since [July 23] to review all of the material that you have made available to us ... In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week... As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 'Game of Thrones' fan changes Toronto-area highway sign to 'Jon Snow' Parkway\n\nSo far, the hackers have released multiple episodes of HBO shows including Game of Thrones, Ballers and Room 104, along with scripts of already-aired and upcoming episodes.\n\nThey've also leaked executive emails, and on Tuesday released the personal phone numbers, email addresses and home addresses of Game of Thrones Season 7 cast members, among them Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Lena Headey (Cersei), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow). All documents that have been leaked bear a watermark with the message \"HBO is Falling.\"\n\nAs of this writing, the email screen grab is the latest move on the part of the hackers. HBO has not publicly commented on their investigation or the \"bounty payment.\"\n\nThe quarter-million offer is peanuts compared to the hackers' original demand: their \"six-month salary in Bitcoin,\" which equals approximately $6 million.\n\nThe hackers claim that they're not criminals, but \"white hats\" (used to reference people of good and moral standing, or, in computer speak, someone who hacks into a network to evaluate its security).\n\nREAD MORE: HBO hackers post 'Game of Thrones' episodes following cyberattack\n\nIn the ransom note sent to HBO, they say \"It's [sic] a game for us. Money isn't our main purpose. We don't want to endanger HBO's situation nor cause it to lose its reputation. We want to be your partner in a tiny part of HBO's huge income.\"\n\nSo far the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\n\nThe hackers claim to have more data, including scripts, upcoming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO. To date, they have released only 3.4 GB of data from the initial hack of 1.5 TB.\n\nVariety reported on Wednesday morning that at least one of the leaked documents seems to have been manipulated by the hackers -- to make it look like they accessed the email of HBO CEO Richard Plepler -- casting doubt on the severity of the hack and the abilities of \"Mr. Smith.\"\n\nFollow @CJancelewicz", "timeCrawl": "14:57:00", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 802, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 809}, {"textStart": 1392, "date": "2017-07-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1399}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8642049", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 3}}

Two separate news outlets claim that an HBO executive offered the hackers $250,000 as a \"bounty payment.\"\n\nA ransom note that was apparently sent to HBO from a hacker calling himself Mr. Smith was leaked on Monday. The hacker demands about $6 million in Bitcoin to prevent any further leaks of HBO shows. According to the ransom note, Time Warner's premium cable network had three days to make the payment.\n\nNow both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter claim that they have obtained a copy of a recent email which includes leaked details of the hacker's correspondence with the HBO executive. One of the leaked messages says that the network has been \"working hard\" to negotiate with the Game of Thrones hackers to extend the ransom deadline by a week.\n\nOne email, according to The Hollywood Reporter, read, \"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\"\n\nVariety has also reportedly confirmed the authenticity of the email. Both publications named the HBO executive in question.\n\nIt must be noted here that HBO is not using the term \"ransom\"; instead, the company is stressing the phrase \"bug bounty payment.\" Bug bounties are pretty common in the tech world, and they're paid to hackers who reveal flaws in companies' cyber-security. Use of this term could help the network avoid legal issues.\n\nSo there are good chances that HBO has submitted to the Game of Thrones hackers' demand and just wants some time to collect the full $250,000 in Bitcoin. However, MarketWatch, citing a source close to the investigation into the hack, says the HBO email \"was an obvious stall tactic and that it should make it apparent that it wasn't an attempt at any real engagement with the hacker.\" An extension would buy the network some time to talk to its employees, distributors and creative talent and analyze the situation.\n\nThe note from the hacker calling himself Mr. Smith included scripts from five Game of Thrones episodes, emails from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming, Leslie Cohen, and two internal documents. One of them was a summary of legal claims against the company, and the other was the job offer letters to the top executives, reports The New York Times.\n\nFollowing the leak of the note on Monday, the network said it is not able to determine whether its entire email system has been hacked. This was the second data leak from the hackers, but so far, the damage to the network has been limited compared to a similar hack on Sony's network in 2014. In that breach, the hackers leaked personal information, including the salaries and social security numbers of employees, and thousands of embarrassing emails. The leaks cost Amy Pascal, who was heading up Sony Pictures at the time of the breach, her job.\n\nThe hackers behind the HBO theft, however, claim to have more data on HBO and its shows and movies, including scripts, episodes and damaging information.", "timeCrawl": "18:12:00", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8676991", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "id": 972, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(Image Source: HBO) HBO data theft: Hackers demand millions in ransom for stolen showsHBO accidentally leaked Game of Thrones episode The DoorHBO near to close deal for 'Game of Thrones' seasons 7, 8\n\nIn a bid to contain further leaks from a group of hackers, HBO reportedly offered to pay $250,000 to those who stole nearly 1.5TB data, including scripts of 'Game of Thrones' (GoT) and other employee information, from the TV network. A purported leaked email, sent to various media publications by the hackers, appeared to come from an HBO executive, offering the 'bug bounty' of $250,000 for showing up weaknesses in the firm's system, Forbes reported late on Friday.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us.

According to the report, the HBO executive wrote that the company had not been able to acquire the amount of Bitcoin, which is nearly $6 million, the hackers had demanded. However, HBO was yet to confirm the veracity of the email.\n\n\"This episode of the HBO hack is turning out to be a 'Game of Thorns' for HBO. As far back as July 27, HBO got into a negotiation with the hackers, it appears,\" said Ankush Johar, Director, BugsBounty.com, in a statement. \"There is a possibility that HBO's pre-emptive bug bounty programme may have yielded a better security posture for them, avoiding this situation altogether,\" he added.\n\nEarlier this week, hackers leaked the script of Episode 5 of 'Game of Thrones' Season 7 that was set to be aired on August 13, along with a note demanding ransom from the US-based television network. The hacked material also contains \"countless\" HBO internal documents, including a month's worth of a top executive's emails, financial balance sheets, employment agreements and marketing-strategy PDFs.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: HBO", "timeCrawl": "11:55:00", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 35, "amb": false, "textEnd": 50}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1445, "date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 1438}, {"textStart": 2322, "date": "2017-08-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2331}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8787099", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "id": 206, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Associations", "id": 1030, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The hackers recently published a publicly accessible link to a treasure trove of data. This latest batch of data included administrator passwords for HBO's internal network, drafts for five Game of Thrones episodes, emails from HBO VP, Leslie Cohen, and the personal phone numbers of Game of Throne actors.\n\nNow they're back and demanding a ransom. In a five-minute video letter from someone called \"Mr Smith\", the hackers told the company to pay within three days or they would reveal more HBO shows and confidential corporate information. Additionally, they would only deal directly with HBO CEO Richard Plepler and only send one letter detailing how to pay. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the text in the video reads: \"We successfully breached into your huge network...HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\"\n\nAlthough the amount of money wasn't specified, the hackers demanded \"our six-month salary in bitcoin\", claiming they \"earn\" $12 million to $15 million a year from blackmailing other organizations they've compromised. HBO is apparently the 17th target of this hacker group with only three companies refusing to pay.\n\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, an HBO spokesperson responded: \"HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nWhile the original motive behind the initial hack was unclear, it seems now that extortion is the end game. Netflix faced a similar conundrum back in April when a hacker group known as the \"TheDarkOverlord\" leaked the fifth season of Orange is the New Black and demanded Netflix pay a ransom. The leak of internal HBO documents seems to prove the authenticity of the hack but it's unknown how HBO plans to respond to the ransom demands.", "timeCrawl": "03:26:00", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8102604", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "id": 50, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "id": 1546, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Special_Decks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Special Decks", "id": 1611, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The TV network reportedly wanted to pay $250,000 in bitcoins to the attackers, disguised as a bug bounty reward rather than a ransom. A few days ago, a report said the hackers asked HBO to pay millions in bitcoins to avoid further leaks.\n\nThe hack was first mentioned a few days ago, after episode 3 of the seventh Game of Thrones season aired. The script for the fourth episode was posted online by hackers, who also shared unreleased TV episodes from HBO shows. That's why you may know it as the Game of Thrones hack, though the hackers did not specifically target the show. Furthermore, it doesn't appear that they actually have possession of any of the unreleased episodes.\n\nThe hackers claimed they stole no less than 1.5TB of data after more than six months of probing the security of HBO's internal network and threatened to reveal more content, including more personal data. Just a few days ago, they posted contact details for some Game of Thrones cast members, as well as internal emails belonging to one HBO exec.\n\nBut the negotiations with HBO aren't going well, a new report explains. The hackers have yet to receive their money, which is why they leaked a purported email exchange with an HBO exec to Hollywood Reporter. The HBO exec apparently crafted a very carefully worded reply to hackers, which avoids any language that would make HBO look like it's ready to pay attackers off.\n\nThe unnamed HBO exec told hackers that the company has \"been working hard since [July 23] to review all of the material that you have made available to us. ...

We're laying out everything you need to know, complete with cybersecurity experts' analysis of this heated situation.\n\nPreviousSlide 1/3Next Here's everything we know.\n\nIn late July, the hackers, who called the incident \"the greatest leak of cyber space era,\" leaked full episodes of \"Ballers\" and \"Room 104\", as well as part of a script from an upcoming \"Game of Thrones\" episode. This initial cache of content was nothing more than proof, though -- proof that there was a total of 1.5 terabytes of data in the hackers' possession to be exposed at their discretion.\n\nThe network responded to first reports of the hack with a statement that read, in part, \"HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information. We immediately began investigating the incident and are working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms. Data protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our responsibility to protect the data we hold.\"\n\nHBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler also responded to the hack with an email to company employees, informing them of the incident and attempting to alleviate concerns. Remember Plepler's name; this isn't the last you'll hear of him.\n\nNearly a week later, the hackers released a mountain of information to outlets, including The Hollywood Reporter. Among this data was an upcoming script summary for \"Game of Thrones\" and a month's worth of \"confidential\" emails from the network's vice president for film programming. Some reports say the leak also included the personal phone numbers of stars like Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage.\n\nThis leak confirmed the hackers have access to more than the network's programming, which could extend to an extensive bank of company emails or even users' personal information.\n\nWith the August 6 release, the hackers also included a video message to Plepler that says, \"We successfully breached into your huge network. ... HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\" They listed the extent of the property they've stolen as well, claiming to have un-aired episodes of hit shows and other confidential company data.\n\nAlso in the message was a ransom request for the bitcoin (untraceable cyber money often used by hackers) equivalent of their six-month salary. They claim that they make $12-$15 million each year, so they're demanding at least $6 million from HBO.\n\nIn the ransom video, the hackers claim HBO is their 17th cyber target, and only three previous targets have refused to pay.\n\nPreviousSlide 2/3Next What should happen next?\n\nAs of now, HBO's focus was last made clear in a statement from Plepler to company employees. \"As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nHe asserted that, while teams were hired as a clean-up crew, it's business as usual for HBO. \"We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident. Meanwhile, our dedicated employees continue to focus on delivering the high quality of entertainment and service for which we are known.\"\n\nBut those cybersecurity firms and the police can only work to tighten up the current security of HBO's network, not take back the 1.5 terabytes that's been stolen from them. So what's the company to do?\n\n\"From a security standpoint, HBO should practice good cyber hygiene (update security systems, inform employees of suspicious emails, etc.),\" says Frances Zelazny, vice president of BioCatch, a cybersecurity firm specializing in fraud prevention and detection. \"[They need] a combination of good authentication, good anti-malware, and real-time continuous authentication on their machines and networks to make sure people are really who they claim they are. Either way the damage is done - the important part is now it is time to clean it up.\"\n\nZelazny notes that the list of tactics hackers could have used to infiltrate the network is endless, including brute forces attack, phishing emails, business email compromises using employee credentials or hacking the system at large. The goal now, she says, is to tighten close those potential holes.\n\nWith this corporate-focused clean-up, one cybersecurity expert says there's one area HBO is likely overlooking completely.\n\n\"What they are unlikely to be looking at are the personal digital lives of key HBO employees and executives,\" says Roderick Jones, founder of digital security firm Rubica. \"This remains an overlooked field in cyber security defense but it isn't overlooked by the hackers who will be looking to probe any and all organizational weaknesses.\"\n\nSince the hackers have demanded a pay day, if the current leaks of information don't get the job done, they may resort to more personal matters to up the ante.\n\nAnd what about that money? How will HBO respond to this high-priced ransom?\n\nThere's no law against paying, Jones says, as \"the rules of the road in cyber-space are still being formed so there are no clear policy guidelines at this time.\" Still, he doubts that the network will reach for its checkbook. \"Given the now high-profile nature of the case, it seems unlikely HBO would pay a ransom given the potential to set a significant precedent and of course provide funding to hacker groups.\"\n\nHe also notes that the hackers' motivations are financial, based on their behavior thus far. \"If they had wanted a big pay day, a better tactical approach would have been to approach HBO discretely. A refusal would presumably trigger a release of the entire set of data the hackers have stolen and the reputation and financial damage to HBO that comes along with that, which seems to be the direction the attackers are going after despite the attempts at setting up a ransom scenario.\"\n\nPreviousSlide 3/3Are everyday users safe?\n\nWhat should be the scariest part of this whole situation is that the current information hackers have admittedly obtained likely doesn't add up to 1.5 terabytes of data. If the hackers are telling the truth, they could have access to more emails or personal data of employees, or that of general HBO users.\n\n\"The dangerous part is that the hackers may have financial data/personal information of people with HBOGO or HBONow accounts, so the population at large is also the victim in this attack,\" Zelazny says. \"HBO's responsibility is to be upfront on what exactly was stolen so consumers could be on high alert as well - they are ultimately the ones who are going to be affected.\"\n\nWhile the hackers haven't suggested they have access to users' personal data, this should be a concern for the public during this time of uncertainty.\n\nYou may not think watching Game of Thrones (which saw its highest viewership ever last week, despite these incidents) may directly affect your cyber security, but hacks such as this are becoming all but a rare occurrence.\n\n\"Americans and businesses should focus on cyber hygiene and keeping themselves informed,\" Zelazny instructs. \"It is all like a loop, the company needs to do what they need to do to protect the 'average Joe' while also understanding the status quo of threat prevention in order to protect themselves. Once you start putting up the chain of events, the fraudster has everything they need - people get fixated on the hack itself and don't realize fraudsters already have their info for other personal accounts (social media, banking, etc.). This is important to realize in order to protect themselves from the fraudsters hacking into their other personal accounts.\"\n\nAnd even if your personal isn't in jeopardy in this instance, don't think you'll sneak away from this attack unscathed.\n\n\"The American public has sadly become used to the constant drumbeat of hacks against companies that hold more personal data than HBO such as health insurance companies and financial institutions, so I doubt the hack will change public perceptions of HBO immediately,\" Jones admits, but he says the hack could still affect your bank account in other ways.\n\n\"Financial perceptions of HBO may change more quickly given the likely cost of this hack and the potential write-down, which HBO could experience as a result. This in turn will create secondary level effects, such as HBO subscription prices having to be increased, which is where the public will begin to see the cause and effect of cyber-attacks,\" Jones warms. \"Given the popularity of GoT, the final season could be offered as a pay-to-view only deal to pay for these attacks, which is the true way to monetize excellent content rather than leaking it and demanding ransom!\"\n\nSo HBO users, while you sit back and watch the madness unfold, you may want to keep an eye on your own information.\n\nStart Slideshow Back to Article Slide of\n\nby Kelsey Patterson | August 10, 2017", "timeCrawl": "04:18:00", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2511, "date": "2017-08-06", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2519}, {"date": "2017-08-10", "textStart": 9644, "amb": false, "textEnd": 9659}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8741946", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "id": 303, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "id": 973, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

We first learned of the breach last Monday, when the hackers put full, unaired episodes of some shows out in the open alongside a partial script for Sunday's Game of Thrones episode, The Spoils of War. Then, earlier this week, those same hackers got a little more serious by releasing more internal data and demanding a ransom to halt the trickle release of information.\n\nThose hackers demanded that HBO pay 6 months of their salary in Bitcoin, and they say they make $12 million to $15 million dollars each year by carrying out data breaches like this and then holding the information they steal ransom. That means HBO would need to pay $6 million to $7.5 million to get them to back off - a pretty penny indeed.\n\nToday, we're hearing that HBO is putting up some amount of money, but it's not nearly the amount the hackers are demanding. CNBC has obtained and verified a July 27 email from an HBO IT employee that says the company is working on establishing an account necessary to buy and send Bitcoin. In the message, the company offers a \"bug bounty payment of $250,000\" as a show of good faith.\n\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean that HBO is planning on paying the full ransom eventually. According to an anonymous source close to the matter, this offer was made as a \"delay tactic.\" That source also notes that HBO is no longer in contact with the hackers, which means that it may just let them release what they have.\n\nOne concern is that these hackers have their hands on significant spoilers for high-profile HBO series like Game of Thrones. So far, only a few Game of Thrones scripts have been released, but there's no telling what else those hackers are sitting on. Internally, HBO has to worry about these hackers releasing sensitive information like emails, contacts, and details on pending litigation.\n\nWe'll see where this ultimately leads, but if HBO has truly cut off contact with the hackers, we'll probably see more information leak before long.

If you'd like to learn more...\n\nThe Game of Thrones and HBO hack is intensifying as several stars of the fantasy TV show have had their phone numbers and personal addresses leaked online.\n\nStory continues below\n\nHackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" launched a cyberattack against HBO on July 31, accessing 1.5 terabytes of the network's data and leaking upcoming episodes of TV shows Ballers, Room 104 and Game of Thrones. They also released the script for an upcoming (at the time) Game of Thrones episode.\n\nREAD MORE: Stephen Amell, 'Arrow' star, responds to haters after attending Vancouver Pride parade\n\nOn Monday, the hackers posted a fresh cache of stolen files, including another upcoming episode script and a month's worth of email from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice-president of film programming. In exchange for their silence, the hackers demanded \"our six-month salary in Bitcoin,\" which would amount to roughly $6 million.\n\nIn the latest development, the hackers have released the personal phone numbers, email addresses and home addresses of Game of Thrones Season 7 cast members, among them Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Lena Headey (Cersei), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) and Kit Harington (Jon Snow). All documents that have been leaked bear a watermark with the message \"HBO is Falling.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Sinead O'Connor posts disturbing video, says she's 'suicidal,' living in a motel\n\nThe hackers claim that they're not criminals, but \"white hats\" (used to reference people of good and moral standing, or, in computer speak, someone who hacks into a network to evaluate its security). In the ransom note sent to HBO, they say \"IIt's[sic] a game for us. Money isn't our main purpose. We don't want to endanger HBO's situation nor cause it to lose its reputation. We want to be your partner in a tiny part of HBO's huge income.\"\n\nAs of this writing, HBO has not bowed to any demands, and is reviewing the data to discover exactly what was leaked.\n\nIn a statement to Wired, HBO spokesperson Jeff Cusson said \"the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised. We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Shaun Weiss, Goldberg from 'Mighty Ducks,' arrested for suspected meth possession\n\nSo far the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\n\nThe hackers claim to have more data, including scripts, upcoming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO. To date, they have released only 3.4 GB of data from the initial hack of 1.5 TB.\n\nVariety reported on Wednesday morning that at least one of the leaked documents seems to have been manipulated by the hackers -- to make it look like they accessed the email of HBO CEO Richard Plepler -- casting doubt on the severity of the hack and the abilities of \"Mr. Smith.\"\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press\n\nFollow @CJancelewicz", "timeCrawl": "15:12:00", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 378, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 385}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8215657", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 7}}

It further added that HBO is the hackers' 17th target and only three of their past targets refused to pay.\n\nIn a statement to Wired, HBO spokesperson Jeff Cusson says \"the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised.\"'In a separate incident, a Game of Thrones episode was leaked last week before going public.

But the HBO executive's missive to the hackers is carefully worded and avoids language that would be construed as paying off the hackers and instead is framed as an offer for a reward for discovering vulnerabilities in HBO's system.\n\nThe HBO executive instead says that the network has \"been working hard since [July 23] to review all of the material that you have made available to us. ... In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\" The email continues, \"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\"\n\nIt is unclear if the HBO email is authentic or if it has been doctored in any way. However, the email to THR is from the same account going by \"Mr. Smith\" that has sent previous messages and proof of stolen content. THR has confirmed that the executive works for HBO in a technology capacity. HBO declined comment.\n\n\"We also have not been able to put into place the necessary infrastructure to be able to make a large payment in bitcoin, although we are taking steps to do so as you suggested,\" the HBO exec says in the email.\n\nOn Aug. 3, the hackers sent an email to THR indicating their motive. \"It's just about money. We have weeks of negotiations with HBO officials, but they broke their promises and want to play with us...,\" the email said.\n\nThe hackers claim to have 1.5 terabytes of data stolen from HBO. So far, they have released some unaired episodes of HBO content including Ballers and Room 104. On Monday, the hackers released a cache of data that contained a script summary for Sunday's Game of Thrones episode as well as 30 days' worth of emails from a programming executive. However, it does not appear that anyone other than journalists have been able to find the link that contains the files.\n\nIn that same data dump, the hackers included what appeared to be their original demands in the form of a video letter to HBO CEO Richard Plepler that says, \"We successfully breached into your huge network. ... HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\" In the letter to Plepler, which unfolds as a scroll set to ominous music, the hackers demand money, though the figure was redacted.\n\nHollywood hacking victims are typically loath to acknowledge that they pay up or even offer to make a payment, as it would set a precedent that could have a ripple effect in the industry. However, in the recent wave of attacks that have hit the industry over the past year, at least one victim has paid the hackers. It is also possible that HBO had no intention of paying the hackers any money and was looking for a way to stall for more time to ascertain the scope of the breach before stolen items were released on the internet.", "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 239, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 246}, {"textStart": 668, "date": "2017-07-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 675}, {"textStart": 1585, "date": "2017-08-03", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1591}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8529463", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 4, "liCnt": 49}}

The group redacted the exact amount of money they were demanding in the ransom letter released Monday.\n\n\"Our demand is clear and non-negotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your data,\" the ransom note from Mr. Smith said in part, Wired reported. \"HBO spends $12 million for market research and $5 million for ('Game of Thrones' season 7) advertisements, so consider us another budget for your advertisements!\"\n\nIn a statement released to Wired, HBO spokesman Jeff Cusson said that the network continues to investigate the data breach.\n\n\"The review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised,\" he told the news site.\n\nHBO officials acknowledged last week that the company had been targeted by hackers who managed to get \"proprietary information.\" The group behind the cyberattack last week released what appeared to be at least one script from \"Game of Thrones\" and episodes of the networks' \"Ballers\" and \"Room 104\" series.\n\nIn the video letter Monday, the hackers claimed that HBO was the 17th company to be targeted by them and that only three previous targets refused to pay, according to the AP. The group said it spends $500,000 each year to buy exploits that allow them to break into networks before Microsoft and other software companies are aware of the security holes.", "timeCrawl": "15:02:00", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8213232", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The Daily Beast posted the full text of the email.\n\n\"In the spirit of professional cooperation,\" the executive asked for a one-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from Game of Thrones episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cyber-security firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's Orange is the New Black ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cyber-security expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, Calif-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSE\n\nThe hackers told news outlets they had upcoming episodes from various shows and a \"Game of Thrones\" script.

As with episode four, an outline of the script has been circulating online in what seems to be the latest leak from the huge HBO hack. And suddenly, it seems like the \"cyber incident\" that some people -- including this blogger -- thought would be catastrophic is just a big, bad empty threat.\n\nImage: HBO\n\nIt seemed like a big deal at first. Nearly two weeks ago, HBO confirmed that hackers had penetrated its servers and stolen some \"proprietary information\". A hacker who identifies himself as \"Mr. Smith\" then leaked the script outline for episode four of Game of Thrones, some episodes of Ballers, as well as some information about other HBO shows, like Room 104.\n\nAt the time, the hacker claimed to have stolen some 1.5TB of data, including information about HBO employees, and demanded a $US6 ($8) million ransom. But HBO stood fast.\n\nThings heated up a few days later, when Variety reported that the hacked data included the some emails of a senior HBO executive. The entertainment newspaper also claimed that there is an image file that \"appears to show screenshots of HBO's internal administration tools, listing employee names and email addresses and their functions within the organisation\".\n\nThat's when comparisons to the catastrophic Sony hack of 2014 really heated up. If these hackers released a boatload of private and confidential information, and if the leaked data included financial information about the company, HBO could be in real trouble.\n\nTrouble is still not out of the question, but it's starting to seem like this hacker might not be holding as much damaging information as he claims. Indeed, some of an HBO executive's emails were stolen. We know this because the hacker released them to media outlets earlier this week. The Hollywood Reporter got the scoop:\n\nThe materials, which mark the first evidence that some HBO private emails are in the hands of hackers, came Monday in an email message to The Hollywood Reporter that also contained nine files with such labels as \"Confidential\" and \"Script GOT7.\" The hackers also delivered a video letter to HBO CEO Richard Plepler that says, \"We successfully breached into your huge network. ... HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\"\n\nTHR is not revealing the contents of the emails or the substance of the leaked Game of Thrones materials, which also includes marketing spreadsheets and media plans for the hit series.\n\nBut, after all this, the fact remains that we still haven't seen any damage that's even close to comparable to the Sony hack that could end up costing that company $US100 ($127) million. We also haven't seen anything super splashy surrounding Game of Thrones, which was always the hacker's big hook in drawing interest to the data breach.\n\nIt is true that a low quality screener of episode four appeared online last week, before the show aired. We later learned, however, that incident was part of a separate leak involving an Indian distribution company. We still have no evidence that the HBO hacker has any Game of Thrones content aside from a few outdated episode outlines.\n\nThe Next Game Of Thrones Episode Just Leaked Days After That Huge HBO Hack\n\nSeason seven, episode four of Game of Thrones is now in the wild. The leaked video comes less than a week after HBO admitted that its servers had been hacked and a large quantity of data had been stolen. We already knew that a script -- or, more specifically, an outline of a script -- of episode four was part of the hack. Now, in a reportedly unrelated incident, it seems the Game of Thrones episode itself has been leaked.\n\nRead more\n\nWe now have evidence that HBO expressed some willingness to pay, at first, however. On Thursday, images of a July 27th email exchange between the hacker and a member of HBO's tech team emerged. They showed that the network offered the hacker $US250,000 ($316,725) to extend the deadline for the larger ransom. The email framed the payment as a \"bug bounty\" that would be paid in \"good faith\".\n\nThe fact that HBO made an offer, by the way, doesn't necessarily mean that HBO was willing to pay. In fact, a source familiar with the matter told Deadline that the figure \"was in fact not even a genuine offer\". HBO was apparently just trying to buy some time.\n\nTime will tell whether this HBO hack will matter. What definitely matters is the fact that big Hollywood studios are now in the crosshairs of hackers around the world. It makes sense, too. Hackers love attention, and there are few better ways to win headlines than to dump a bunch of unreleased entertainment online for free. The fact that employee data and financial information could be included as well gives companies like HBO (or Sony) a good reason to pay the ransom.\n\nTo paraphrase the immortal words of Brad Pitt's character in Burn After Reading, everybody -- from Hollywood studios to your aunt in Virginia -- needs to worry about the security of their shit.\n\nThings will probably get worse before they get better, when it comes to cyber incidents like this. Do your best to end up on the better side.\n\nWATCH MORE: Tech News", "timeCrawl": "22:16:00", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3829, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3838}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8849290", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Alongside their threat was a 3.4 GB cache of other data they claim was stolen from HBO.\n\nThese include draft script of an upcoming \"Game of Thrones\" episode, a month's worth of emails, folders titled \"Budgets,\" \"Legal,\" and \"Licensing and Retail,\" and contact information of some of the show's cast including Emilia Clarke, Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey.\n\nThe demands were made via a video addressed to HBO's CEO, Richard Plepler. In a cruel joke, the video was also set to the tune of the \"Game of Thrones'\" opening theme. The video was also \"peppered with misspellings and pop-culture references.\"\n\nAccording to the hackers, it took six months to break into HBO's network and the consider the millions of dollars they are demanding as \"salary.\" The group claimed they have stolen about 1 TB of data from HBO after breaching the network's back in July.\n\nThey also claimed that they make about $12 to $15 million annually from blackmailing which means that the money from the network will only consist half their payday. HBO has three days to pay the ransom and according to the hackers, should the deadline pass, they will dump all the information onto the internet.\n\nThe FBI and the cyber security firm Mandiant are already working with HBO to get to the bottom of the issue.

The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nRead more: HBO hackers demand millions in ransom for stolen files, scripts\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multimillion dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional co-operation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from Game of Thrones episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice-president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's Orange is the New Black ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spearfishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"", "timeCrawl": "21:11:00", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 187, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 194}, {"textStart": 1764, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1771}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8701810", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Polay/HBO / AP\n\nThis file image released by HBO shows Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister in an episode of \"Game of Thrones\" that aired Sunday, Aug. 6, 2017.\n\nBy Matt O'Brien and Tali Arbel, Associated Press\n\nFriday, Aug. 11, 2017 | 1:05 p.m.\n\nBOSTON -- Hackers released an email from HBO in which the company expressed willingness to pay them $250,000 as part of a negotiation over electronic data swiped from HBO's servers.\n\nThe July 27 email was sent by John Beyler, an HBO executive who thanked the hackers for \"making us aware\" of previously unknown security vulnerabilities. The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from \"Game of Thrones\" episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"\n\nArbel reported from New York.", "timeCrawl": "20:13:00", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-06", "textStart": 159, "amb": false, "textEnd": 171}, {"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 232, "amb": false, "textEnd": 245}, {"textStart": 446, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 453}, {"textStart": 1947, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1954}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8694278", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It has unusual to see such a huge corporation engaging with a hacker at all while the HBO may have had no intention of paying.\n\nThe hackers seem to either have to look for substantially more or only to embarrass HBO, and evidently, the payment has never made. From the hackers, it received an email a week ago saying that \"it is just about money. They broke their promises and wanted to play with us but with the HBO officials, we have weeks of negotiations.\n\nTwo days ago, the hackers last released HBO data when they published the home addresses and phone number belonging to some Game of Thrones stars.", "timeCrawl": "18:12:00", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8676995", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "id": 343, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It looks like the cyber security incident affecting the \"Game of Thrones\" network may be getting a lot worse.\n\nThe person -- or group -- who claimed last week to have hacked HBO has now released what appears to be a trove of stolen information -- and the network has called in the FBI for help.\n\nThose documents are said to include \"Game of Thrones\" scripts, personal emails that belong to an HBO executive, and other proprietary information, according to reports.\n\n\"HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing,\" an HBO representative told NBC News. \"While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nRelated: HBO Hacked, Thieves Claim to Have 'Game of Thrones' Info\n\nThe apparent hacker or hackers, who go by the name \"Mr. Smith,\" also released a video addressing HBO Chairman and CEO Richard Plepler, demanding the company pay a ransom in order to stop further leaks, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNBC News has not seen the alleged video. However, in it, the hackers reportedly ask for their \"six-month salary\" to be paid in Bitcoin -- implying that the figure would be around $6 million.\n\nHBO has not commented on the scope of the breach nor the specifics of what was stolen.\n\nLast week, material that had yet to air from \"Ballers\" and \"Room 104\" was apparently leaked online, according to reports. Various reports claim the hackers have 1.5 terabytes of data. For some perspective, 1 TB can hold an estimated 500 hours worth of movies, according to a ballpark estimate from PC Ninja.\n\nMr. Smith also reportedly claims HBO is its 17th target -- and that only three others have failed to pay.\n\nThe FBI does not support paying ransom to criminals and has, in previous instances, made the point that there is no guarantee a victim's proprietary information would be returned. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center -- also known as IC3 -- collects reports about internet-facilitated crimes.\n\n\"Paying a ransom emboldens the adversary to target other victims for profit, and could provide incentive for other criminals to engage in similar illicit activities for financial gain,\" the FBI wrote in a bulletin last year.\n\nHowever, the decision is ultimately up to the victim. The FBI said \"it recognizes executives, when faced with inoperability issues, will evaluate all options to protect their shareholders, employees, and customers.\"\n\nHBO's statement said the company's team is working \"around the clock with outside cyber security firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident. Meanwhile, our dedicated employees continue to focus on delivering the high quality of entertainment and service for which we are known.\"\n\nThe hacking nightmare -- just the latest in a string of incidents that have shaken Hollywood -- unfolded last week, prompting Plepler to break the news to employees in an email on July 31.\n\n\"Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are working round the clock to protect our collective interests,\" he wrote.\n\nDespite it all, some \"Game of Thrones\" fans are vowing not to look at the leaked materials.\n\nScrew you \"Mr.Smith,\" I'll wait for HBO to release GOT #GameOfThrones #hbohack -- John Butler (@butlerbssp)\n\nAugust 8, 2017\n\nIf you are a true fan, you'd simply ignore the leak! @HBO @HBO_UK #GOT #leaked -- [ W ] (@itswaynebtw)\n\nAugust 8, 2017\n\nNetflix fell victim to hackers earlier this year when some episodes of \"Orange Is the New Black\" were leaked prior to the series' June release date.\n\nAs far as entertainment industry hacks go, Sony suffered the biggest one yet in 2014 when thieves leaked personal information and email exchanges, some of which were between actors and executives. The hack was apparently prompted by the satirical film \"The Interview,\" in which a news crew scores an interview with Kim Jong Un -- and is asked by the CIA to assassinate him.\n\nHowever, sometimes an alleged hack isn't quite what it seems. Some hackers have been known to overstate their claims. Earlier this year, Disney was the target of a hoax, in which hackers claimed to have a copy of the newest \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film in their possession.", "timeCrawl": "04:54:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3113, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3120}, {"date": "2017-08-08", "textStart": 3606, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3620}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8112203", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "id": 50, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "id": 101, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "id": 457, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Roleplaying", "id": 1189, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

While the amount of data is nearly seven times that of the 2014 Sony hack, the impact has so far been much less catastrophic.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the hackers conveyed their demands in a five-minute video aimed at HBO CEO Richard Plepler, and insisted they would upload unaired episodes of HBO shows and confidential company data within three days if they weren't paid in full.\n\nThe video - which mostly consists of white text on a black background - calls for their \"six-month salary in bitcoin\", which turns out to be around $6 million (roughly Rs. 38.2 crores), given their claim of annual blackmail compensation as $12 million (roughly Rs. 76.5 crores). The hackers claim it took six months to break into HBO's network, which is supposed to justify the ransom.\n\nThe phone and email details of Game of Thrones stars were part of a larger 3.4GB data dump, which also include passwords for internal HBO use, draft script for next Sunday's Game of Thrones episode, and a month's worth of emails from HBO film programming VP Leslie Cohen.

Last week, hackers reportedly requested a ransom payment of around $6 million in exchange for the Game of Thrones leak and other episode leaks of popular HBO shows. HBO responded to the hacker's request with its own, much lower offer of $250,000 as \"bounty payment,\" asking the hackers to extend the ransom payment deadline, according to messages obtained by Variety.\n\nAccording to the report from Variety, the offer HBO sent to hackers was intended to stall for time while the company assessed the seriousness of the hack. The message reportedly read, \"You have the advantage of having surprised us. In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nSo far, few leaks from Game of Thrones Season 7 have actually surfaced on the internet. Though Season 7, Episode 4, \"The Spoils of War,\" was released online a few days before the premiere, that leak was apparently unrelated to the HBO hack. No other episodes have surfaced yet, unlike the case in the Orange is the New Black hack, when all the entire season was posted online months before the premiere date. An industry insider spoke to Deadline, saying that this delay could mean the hackers don't actually have much Game of Thrones content to release.\n\nMacall B. Polay/Courtesy of HBO\n\nThe insider said,\n\nIf they had something they would have put it out there by now like what happened with Netflix. Either they didn't get far, there wasn't a lot to get or what they got is in too many pieces to add up to much.\n\nNew evidence also suggests that the latest dump from the hack -- HBO executive emails -- may have been faked documents, forged to look as though the hackers had access to HBO chairman/CEO Richard Plepler's email account. With only three episodes left in the season, the hackers are definitely on a ticking clock if they actually do have some shocking Game of Thrones content to reveal.\n\nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge, for more stories you don't want to miss.", "timeCrawl": "18:12:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8676994", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "id": 206, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

US TV network HBO have issued a ransom demand backed up by personal details of actors working for the organisation, including phone numbers and addresses.\n\nThis is despite claims by HBO that its email system as a whole has not been compromised, but it has acknowledged the theft of \"proprietary information\", according to the New York Times.\n\nThe ransom demand comes just over a week after HBO was breached and the unknown group of hackers claimed to have stolen 1.5TB of corporate data.\n\nThe attackers have also released corporate emails and draft Game of Thrones scripts, threatening to release more data including un-aired TV shows if HBO fails to pay the ransom within three days.\n\nIn a video message to HBO chief executive Richard Plepler, the hackers demanded a ransom of \"our six-month salary in bitcoin\", which they implied be at least $6m, reports Associated Press.\n\nThe hacking group claims to earn $12m to $15m from holding data ransom, but also said they spend $500,000 a year purchasing zero-day exploits to break into networks, according to The Guardian.\n\nIn March this year, a report by Watchguard revealed that 30% of malware attacks are zero-day exploits that cannot be identified by legacy antivirus systems because they have not been seen in the wild before.\n\nEternalBlue, a Microsoft zero-day exploit collected by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacking group, was a key component in the WannaCry ransomware that affected more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries in May 2017.\n\nThe HBO hackers claimed it took six months to access the TV network's IT systems and that HBO is the 17th organisation they have compromised and held to ransom.\n\nSecurity commentators say that with firms such as HBO and Netflix increasingly streaming content online, cyber attacks on entertainment companies have become a firm trend.\n\nStephen Gates, chief research intelligence analyst for security firm Zenedge, said the HBO breach is a perfect example of hackers knowing what is of most value to their victims, and using it to their advantage. \"Any way you look at it, a ransom like this only works when someone wants their property back,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Gates, the hackers must have been inside the network for a considerable period of time. \"Whether the doorway was left opened by an insider or someone was simply phished, regardless of the catalyst, it appears no one knew that hackers had gained access and remained resident inside the network,\" he said.\n\n\"This was not the work of amateurs and could prove to be very costly for HBO - if not financially, then potentially by damaging its reputation, depending on what else the hackers had access to.\"\n\nThe HBO breach has been likened to the 2014 cyber attack on Sony, in which hackers believed by US officials to be linked to North Korea broke into the corporate network and stole data, including unreleased films, emails and the personal details of nearly 50,000 past and present employees, including some celebrities.\n\nAlthough the impact of the HBO breach has not been as great, the amount of data the hackers claim to have stolen is about 7.5 times the amount released by the Sony hackers. At the time, the Sony hackers claimed to have stolen 100TB of data, but that claim was never substantiated.\n\nIn 2016, hackers calling themselves Dark Overlord stole unreleased shows from Netflix, ABC and others, threatening to release the stolen content if their ransom demands were not met.\n\nDespite the targeted production house reportedly paying $50,000 in ransom, some of the stolen content was leaked, including an unreleased season of Orange is the new black from Netflix.", "timeCrawl": "19:53:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 1588, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1596}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8262023", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "id": 101, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "id": 457, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "id": 972, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion_Detection_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Intrusion Detection Systems", "id": 973, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 17}}

The group said it spends $500,000 each year to buy exploits that allow them to break into networks before Microsoft and other software companies are aware of the security holes.", "timeCrawl": "12:06:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8179350", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "id": 972, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As with episode 4, an outline of the script has been circulating online in what seems to be the latest leak from the huge HBO hack. And suddenly, it seems like the \"cyber incident\" that some people -- including this blogger -- thought would be catastrophic is just a big, bad empty threat.\n\nIt seemed like a big deal at first. Nearly two weeks ago, HBO confirmed that hackers had penetrated its servers and stolen some \"proprietary information.\" A hacker who identifies himself as \"Mr. Smith\" then leaked the script outline for episode 4 of Game of Thrones, some episodes of Ballers, as well as some information about other HBO shows, like Room 104. At the time, the hacker claimed to have stolen some 1.5 terabytes of data, including information about HBO employees, and demanded a $6 million ransom. But HBO stood fast.\n\nThings heated up a few days later, when Variety reported that the hacked data included the some emails of a senior HBO executive. The entertainment newspaper also claimed that there is an image file that \"appears to show screenshots of HBO's internal administration tools, listing employee names and email addresses and their functions within the organization.\" That's when comparisons to the catastrophic Sony hack of 2014 really heated up. If these hackers released a boatload of private and confidential information, and if the leaked data included financial information about the company, HBO could be in real trouble.\n\nTrouble is still not out of the question, but it's starting to seem like this hacker might not be holding as much damaging information as he claims. Indeed, some of an HBO executive's emails were stolen. We know this because the hacker released them to media outlets earlier this week. The Hollywood Reporter got the scoop:\n\nThe materials, which mark the first evidence that some HBO private emails are in the hands of hackers, came Monday in an email message to The Hollywood Reporter that also contained nine files with such labels as \"Confidential\" and \"Script GOT7.\" The hackers also delivered a video letter to HBO CEO Richard Plepler that says, \"We successfully breached into your huge network. ... HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded (it took about 6 months).\"\n\nTHR is not revealing the contents of the emails or the substance of the leaked Game of Thrones materials, which also includes marketing spreadsheets and media plans for the hit series.\n\nBut, after all this, the fact remains that we still haven't seen any damage that's even close to comparable to the Sony hack that could end up costing that company $100 million. We also haven't seen anything super splashy surrounding Game of Thrones, which was always the hacker's big hook in drawing interest to the data breach. It is true that a low quality screener of episode 4 appeared online last week, before the show aired. We later learned, however, that incident was part of a separate leak involving an Indian distribution company. We still have no evidence that the HBO hacker has any Game of Thrones content aside from a few outdated episode outlines.\n\nWe now have evidence that HBO expressed some willingness to pay, at first, however. On Thursday, images of a July 27th email exchange between the hacker and a member of HBO's tech team emerged. They showed that the network offered the hacker $250,000 to extend the deadline for the larger ransom. The email framed the payment as a \"bug bounty\" that would be paid in \"good faith.\" The fact that HBO made an offer, by the way, doesn't necessarily mean that HBO was willing to pay. In fact, a source familiar with the matter told Deadline that the figure \"was in fact not even a genuine offer.\" HBO was apparently just trying to buy some time.\n\nTime will tell whether this HBO hack will matter. What definitely matters is the fact that big Hollywood studios are now in the crosshairs of hackers around the world. It makes sense, too. Hackers love attention, and there are few better ways to win headlines than to dump a bunch of unreleased entertainment online for free. The fact that employee data and financial information could be included as well gives companies like HBO (or Sony) a good reason to pay the ransom.\n\nTo paraphrase the immortal words of Brad Pitt's character in Burn After Reading, everybody -- from Hollywood studios to your aunt in Virginia -- needs to worry about the security of their shit. Things will probably get worse before they get better, when it comes to cyber incidents like this. Do your best to end up on the better side.", "timeCrawl": "14:33:00", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3283, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3292}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8804261", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "id": 541, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(HBO via AP, File)\n\nEmilia Clarke and Lena Headey's cell phone numbers have reportedly been leaked online by Game Of Thrones hackers as part of a multi-million dollar ransom request.\n\nThe hackers, who illegally broke into HBO's computer networks, claim to have taken 1.5 terabytes of data, including the fourth episode of season seven, which aired in the U.S. on Sunday, and was released illegally on Friday - days after a script from the newest instalment of the fantasy series was published on the Internet.\n\nNow the culprits have leaked more confidential data, along with a five-minute video letter to HBO chief executive officer Richard Plepler, demanding that their ransom is paid within the next three days or they will drop their entire hacked haul online.\n\nAlongside the video, the hackers posted 3.4 gigabytes of files, including draft scripts from five upcoming Game of Thrones episodes and emails sent from HBO's vice president for film programming, Leslie Cohen.\n\nIn total, more than 50 confidential documents, the majority of which are internal to HBO, were released by the hackers on Tuesday.\n\nOne document released appears to list personal phone numbers and email addresses for cast members Emilia, Lena and Peter Dinklage.\n\nIn the video, the hackers, who are fronted by a man who refers to himself only as \"Mr. Smith\", say they will only deal directly with Plepler, and are demanding \"our six-month salary in bit coin\". Given their claims that they earn between US$12 million and $15 million through blackmailing organisations whose networks they have breached, they are thought to be demanding between $6 million and $7.5 million in ransom.\n\nThe hackers also claim it took them six months to break into HBO's network, although the organisation states that while they do not believe their email system as a whole has been compromised, they do acknowledge the theft of \"proprietary information\".\n\nHBO bosses have called in the FBI to investigate the security breach, while also working with police and cybersecurity experts in an attempt to prevent the release of any more information or unaired episodes.", "timeCrawl": "13:59:00", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "id": "8201527", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from \"Game of Thrones\" episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"", "timeCrawl": "19:44:00", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 187, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 194}, {"textStart": 1688, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1695}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8690289", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

They have claimed to make $12 to $15 million a year and have also said out of their 17 ransom targets, only 3 decided not to pay.\n\n\"[Network has] been working hard since [July 23] to review all of the material that you have made available to us. ... In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\n\n\"We also have not been able to put into place the necessary infrastructure to be able to make a large payment in bitcoin, although we are taking steps to do so as you suggested,\" HBO exec's email.\n\nHBO hackers have so far leaked the data in two separate dumps, with one releasing script of the Game of Thrones season 7 episode 4, unaired episodes of Ballers and Room 104, and the second leak dumping administrator passwords and GoT stars' contact details along with a top executive's emails.\n\nIt is likely the situation will only escalate from here. While the network is working with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to put an end to this, it is surprising to see that it even made an offer to the hackers. So far, we have rarely heard of any big companies acquiescing to ransom demands or even negotiating with hackers at all.\n\nVariety adds that the email also asked hackers to extend their ransom payment deadline for one week. \"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" the email from the unnamed HBO exec reads. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nIt should be noted that this email was sent before both the data dumps. It is likely that HBO was trying to not have anything leaked out in public. The stalling tactic apparently didn't work, though. With hackers now leaking their communication with the network, it appears they are either trying to embarrass the company even more or are just frustrated with this delay.\n\n\"It's just about money,\" they wrote to The Hollywood Reporter. \"We have weeks of negotiations with HBO officials, but they broke their promises and want to play with us.\"", "timeCrawl": "03:04:00", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 500, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 507}, {"textStart": 1270, "date": "2017-07-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1277}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8526314", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

HBO has declined to comment on the matter.\n\nVariety claims it spoke to a source close to the HBO investigation into the hack, who was able to confirm the authenticity of the email. The source added that the non-confrontational wording - as opposed to the outright public statements of non-negotiation policy uttered by other hacked companies - was a \"way to stall for time while [HBO] attempted to assess the serious situation\".\n\nHBO hoped that a quarter of a million payment would be enough to prevent any leaks, but as we now know, that wasn't to be the case.

Weeks after anonymous hackers broke into the cable network's servers and made off with media samples that they intended to leak unless paid a ransom, these same perpetrators have released an email detailing that an HBO executive did try to take them up on the offer. While the network is still investigating the separate leak of episode 4 of \"#Game of Thrones\" season 7 (not that it ruined its viewer ratings), they now have to contend with this apparent hacker expos\u00e9. The email was distributed by the digital #pirates to several entertainment news outlets such as The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe hackers responsible for the recent electronic theft of certain show episodes and scripts from HBO have begun circulating in a screenshot of an email they allegedly received from a network high-up. In it, the executive mentions HBO being willing to offer a monetary amount of $250,000 to the pirates, though rather than a ransom it is listed as a \"bug bounty payment.\" The network boss also described the transaction as a \"token of good faith\" on the part of HBO, and that the $250,000 will be made available to the pirates as soon as they can open up an account and convert the cash to bitcoin.\n\nA close scrutiny of the email's text appears to indicate a conciliatory tone in the HBO executive's message. Rather than frame the money as a payoff for the hackers it is instead construed as compensation for the hackers discovering unprotected access paths to the network's server systems.\n\nIt also noted that the executive requested them to have their deadline extended for a week before they release more of the material (like the \"Game of Thrones\" script) to illegal channels.\n\nHBO has declined to comment on this latest development, and there is a certainty that the hackers never received any such payment even if the email was authentic, according to The Verge. The leak of the email to media outlets has at least been confirmed to have come from a representative of the hackers known as \"Mr. Smith\" that first broke the news of their piracy, previously sending proof of their stolen content to THR.

CDT August 11, 2017 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST\n\nBOSTON -- Hackers released an email from HBO in which the company expressed willingness to pay them $250,000 as part of a negotiation over electronic data swiped from HBO's servers.\n\nThe July 27 email was sent by John Beyler, an HBO executive who thanked the hackers for \"making us aware\" of previously unknown security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt appears to be an effort by the hackers to embarrass HBO, according to The Hollywood Reporter, which obtained a copy of the email. The Daily Beast posted the full text of the email.\n\n\"In the spirit of professional cooperation,\" the executive asked for a one-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from Game of Thrones episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cyber-security firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's Orange is the New Black ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cyber-security expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, Calif-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"\n\n\u00a9 2017 Associated Press\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "timeCrawl": "21:14:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 70, "amb": false, "textEnd": 85}, {"textStart": 315, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 322}, {"textStart": 2049, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2056}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8702387", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In short: Pay up within three days or see the group, which claims to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of HBO shows and confidential corporate data, upload entire series and sensitive proprietary files.\n\nSpecifically, the hackers demanded \"our 6-month salary in bitcoin,\" and claimed they earn $12 million to $15 million a year from blackmailing organizations whose networks they have penetrated. They said they would only deal directly with \"Richard\" and only send one \"letter\" detailing how to pay.\n\nThe dump itself was just 3.4 gigabytes -- mostly technical data that appears to provide a topography of HBO's network and to list network-administrator passwords. It includes what appear to be draft scripts from five \"Game of Thrones\" episodes, including one upcoming episode, and a month's worth of e-mail apparently from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming.\n\nThe network reiterated Monday that it doesn't believe that its e-mail system as a whole has been compromised. The video text was written in often flawed but fluent English peppered with misspellings and pop-culture references.\n\nThe hackers claimed it took them about six months to breach HBO's network. Their biggest threat appears to be dumping videos of future shows online with their logo \"HBO Is Falling\" superimposed.\n\nMany of the more than 50 internal documents in the dump were labeled \"confidential,\" including a spreadsheet of legal claims against the network, job offer letters to several top executives, slides discussing future technology plans and a list of 37,977 e-mails called \"Richard's Contact list,\" an apparent reference to Plepler.\n\nOne screenshot labeled \"Highly Confidential\" by the hackers listed folders such as \"Penguin Random House,\" \"Licensing & Retail,\" \"Legal,\" \"International\" and \"Budgets.\" Another document appears to contain the confidential cast list for \"Game of Thrones,\" listing personal cellphone numbers and e-mail addresses for actors such as Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey and Emilia Clark.\n\nSo far, however, the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In that attack, hackers possibly associated with North Korea unearthed thousands of embarrassing e-mails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\n\nThe video letter uploaded Monday claimed the hackers spend a half million dollars a year to purchase \"zero-day\" exploits that let them break into networks through holes not yet know to Microsoft and other software companies. It claims HBO is the hackers' 17th target and that only three of their past targets refused to pay.", "timeCrawl": "22:54:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8076607", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "id": 26, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Direct_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Direct Marketing", "id": 941, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Vendors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Vendors", "id": 970, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "id": 972, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

A few days after HBO sent the note, the hackers went to the media with details of the breach.\n\nThey released an extortion note and some stolen data, including details about an upcoming episode of the network's popular drama \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nVariety earlier reported details about the $250,000 offer.", "timeCrawl": "19:30:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2012-08-01", "textStart": 249, "amb": false, "textEnd": 263}, {"imp": true, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 615, "date": "2017-07-27", "textStart": 608}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8688465", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "id": 69, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "id": 343, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nThe same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nThe first HBO hack became publicly known on July 31. Then, last week, hackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded that the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe leaks included scripts from \"Game of Thrones\" episodes and a month's worth of email from the account of HBO's vice president for film programming. There were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"\n\nArbel reported from New York.\n\nNever miss another Facebook post from WISH-TV", "timeCrawl": "20:54:00", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 192, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 199}, {"textStart": 1693, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1700}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8699507", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In short: Pay up within three days or see the group, which claims to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of HBO shows and confidential corporate data, upload entire series and sensitive proprietary files.\n\nSpecifically, the hackers demanded \"our 6-month salary in bitcoin,\" and claimed they earn $12 million to $15 million a year from blackmailing organizations whose networks they have penetrated. They said they would only deal directly with \"Richard\" and only send one \"letter\" detailing how to pay.\n\nThe dump itself was just 3.4 gigabytes -- mostly technical data that appears to provide a topography of HBO's network and to list network-administrator passwords. It includes what appear to be draft scripts from five \"Game of Thrones\" episodes, including one upcoming episode, and a month's worth of email apparently from the account of Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming.\n\nThe network reiterated Monday that it doesn't believe that its email system as a whole has been compromised.\n\nThe video text was written in often flawed but fluent English peppered with misspellings and pop-culture references.\n\nThe hackers claimed it took them about 6 months to breach HBO's network.

It's sad, I know, but it's ritual at this point, seven seasons in, and I cherish that hour or so, when all the week's juicy plot lines advance in completely surprising and almost-always satisfying fashion. So why would I want to spoil that by watching a leaked version prior to Sunday?\n\nApparently I'm not the only one who feels that way, either, because despite the fact that hackers posted GoT's \"Spoils of War\" episode online prior to Sunday night's debut, a record-breaking 10.2 million viewers still tuned into HBO to see what has to be one of the show's best efforts yet. That breaks the previous ratings record set by the show's hotly anticipated season premiere, three episodes prior.\n\nRatings records aside, HBO still has a hacking problem. It's not just a Game of Thrones problem. The Rock's sports-agency-gone-wild show, Ballers, and the Duplass Brothers' new semi-supernatural anthology series, Room 104, have also had episodes leaked. And as they await a multi-million-dollar ransom from HBO and C.E.O. Richard Plepler, the hackers - who call themselves \"Mr. Smith\" - have been releasing upcoming scripts, executive emails, and even actors' contact info. And they're threatening to do even more damage if HBO doesn't pay.\n\nOn Tuesday, HBO maintained their initial stance towards the hackers, stating to Vanity Fair:\n\n\"HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised. We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident. Meanwhile, our dedicated employees continue to focus on delivering the high quality of entertainment and service for which we are known.\"\n\nThat last bit is the part that statement that really hits home for me. For years now, the network has delivered the very best original television content around. And I for one don't mind paying for it. They earned it. And they earn it every Game of Thrones episode, which continue to get better because HBO continues to invest in it heavily. What did these hackers do to deserve a cut of it? Nothing. So go stuff it hackers, and keep waiting on your ransom, while me and 10.2 million of my like-minded friends keep filling HBO's pockets.", "timeCrawl": "19:47:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8475187", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "id": 1546, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

In a video, the hackers implied a ransom demand of around $6 million in exchange for not releasing any more data.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether the offer of payment was genuine, the email still highlights the delicate balance companies increasingly have to address when blackmail-focused hackers attack their networks.\n\nThe full email an HBO employee sent to the hackers:\n\n\"We have received your letters and we appreciate your [sic] making us aware of security vulnerabilities we had not previously know about,\" the email, seemingly in response to the hackers contacting HBO, reads. The Daily Beast has decided not to release the staffer's name, since he is not an executive at the company.\n\nThe employee then asks the hackers to extend their extortion deadline \"in the spirit of professional cooperation\" by another week.\n\n\"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin, or we can wire the funds as soon as you give us the account information,\" the email reads. A bug bounty is where companies typically pay security researchers for details on vulnerabilities they uncover in a website or product.\n\nHBO declined to comment on the email.\n\nThe group or individual which allegedly hacked HBO provided the email to The Daily Beast. Databreaches.net also published the email in full, but The Daily Beast obtained it independently and was able to confirm it was sent by an HBO employee.\n\nIn a statement given earlier this week, after a recent release of material, HBO told The Daily Beast the company \"believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\n\"We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident.

For HBO and other companies targeted by cyber criminals, that is increasingly becoming the question.\n\nThe network behind Game of Thrones is the latest victim of a massive digital breach, with hackers claiming to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data that includes unreleased show episodes, scripts, and internal company documents.\n\nNow, the perpetrators behind the cyber heist are demanding a solid chunk of Bitcoin as ransom, threatening to dump the pilfered info online unless HBO pays up.\n\nSo should HBO pay the ransom? And what happens if it does?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer isn't exactly clear. HBO isn't the first company to be hit with some digital form of extortion. In April of this year, a group managed to get its hands on unreleased episodes of Netflix's Orange is the New Black, and asked for a payment of \"tens of thousands of dollars in electronic currency\" in exchange for not releasing the files.\n\nNetflix decided not to pay, and the episodes were later leaked to a torrent site. As you've surely noticed, Netflix seems to be doing just fine after the ordeal. Does that mean HBO should take a page out of Netflix's book? Maybe, but maybe not.\n\n\"Publicly paying a ransom has the unfortunate byproduct of encouraging the bad behavior,\" Dimitri Sirota, the CEO and co-founder of data privacy company BigID explained over email. \"If crime pays, it invariably leads to more crime.\"\n\n\"It's possible to make the counter argument,\" he added, \"that if you pay now, the target and similar companies win a reprieve to plug security holes and fight another day while minimizing immediate collateral damage.\"\n\nNotably, the latest HBO hack appears to differ from last April's -- with hackers claiming to have more than just the upcoming season of shows like Vice Principals. The hackers, in broken English, claimed they obtained \"highly confidential documents\" including IT related data, show scripts, financial documents and more.\n\nIf we are to take the hackers at their word, which of course is a risky proposition, it would seem that they can release more than show spoilers should HBO decide not to pay up. Speaking of which, how much are the hackers demanding, anyway?\n\nThe public ransom note itself isn't exactly clear, using \"XXXX\" to represent what presumably is a hard figure presented to HBO. We reached out directly to the group via email, but so far its members have declined to clarify the amount. We can, however, gather an approximate ransom from the 1,712 word ramble. The crew says they make around \"12-15 million dollars\" annually, and want HBO to fork over the equivalent of six months worth of \"salary.\"\n\nAs to how HBO should pay? The ransom note left nothing in doubt: Bitcoin. The pseudonymous cryptocurrency has long been a favorite of ransomware authors, and it appears that that proclivity has extended to digital extorters as well.\n\nAnd while we only have examples from companies or hackers that have gone public, if HBO does go ahead and score $6.5 million worth of Bitcoin to buy off its extorters, it will be breaking with past hacking victims that have mostly elected not to cooperate.\n\nWhy all the decisions not to play ball? Well, it's hard to say for sure (we reached out to HBO to see if it's considering paying, but a spokesperson refused to comment), but at least from the outside the calculus is pretty clear: Essentially, the damage has already been done.\n\nThere's no way to know that the hackers won't dump the information, regardless if a payment is made or not. It perhaps makes more sense to work from the assumption that everything stolen will be released at some point or another, and to spend whatever cash you would have forked over to the attackers on readying your company for the storm.\n\nOf course, it's entirely possible that other entertainment companies have paid out ransom in order prevent the release of stolen files. Those companies, however, likely kept that information close to the chest. In fact, according to The Hollywood Reporter, at least one \"Hollywood company\" has paid a such a ransom, although the publication did not name it.\n\nShould HBO follow suit? Alex Heid, a white hat hacker and Chief Research Officer at SecurityScorecard, thinks no.\n\n\"It is never a good idea to pay a ransom during a cyber-extortion attempt,\" he told Mashable via email, \"especially when the extortion attempt revolves around a threat of potential malicious action in the near future.\" Heid added that \"there is a good chance that the data has already been shared among numerous individuals involved or associated with the attack, and there is no guarantee that the data won't end up online for the general public or hacking underground communities even after the ransom has been paid.\"\n\nBut what if HBO decides to hope for the best and pay anyway? The crew behind the hack might very well get away with it. As we saw with the WannaCry ransomware, Bitcoin ransom can be quickly moved and there are numerous ways to launder it.\n\nOh, also, things might not turn out so great for the New York-based company. If HBO makes it clear that it's willing to give into the demands, according to Heid it won't be a shock if other hackers came knocking.\n\n\"The payment of ransoms embolden attackers to continue with these types of campaigns,\" he noted, \"and there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored.\"\n\nSo, to pay or not to pay? For HBO and other companies suffering from cybersecurity breaches, it's a garbage question with no good answer. Unfortunately for all involved, it's also a question that going forward will need to be answered -- likely time and time again.", "timeCrawl": "23:35:00", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8081041", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "id": 26, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development", "id": 261, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "id": 271, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "id": 1050, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 7, "liCnt": 92}}

Earlier this week, a ransom demand was put in place and as a show of power, the hackers also released confidential emails and new Game of Thrones details. Now, we have learned that HBO has been trying to bargain with the hackers, even offering them a $250,000 'bug bounty' award to give the company more time.\n\nThe person or group behind the HBO hack claims to have around 1.5TB of data from the company, including emails, scripts, episodes of TV shows and more. The hackers first contacted HBO with a ransom note on the 23rd of July, then on the 27th of July, HBO offered money in exchange for a deadline extension.\n\nCNET managed to get hold of the email and verify its legitimacy, here is what it said: \"We have received your letters and we appreciate your making us aware of security vulnerabilities we had not previously known about\".\n\nThe email then goes on to tell the hackers that HBO has \"a bug bounty program to reward 'white hat' IT professionals\" who point out security flaws. The email then goes on to state that the company has not been able to look through everything the hackers sent over or obtain a large enough sum of Bitcoin to meet demands. From there, it says: \"You have the advantage of having surprised us. In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week. As a show of good faith our our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire Bitcoin.\"\n\nNow it is important to note that this wasn't necessarily a cooperation effort on HBO's part but rather, a tactic to stall for time while investigations were underway.

The executive asked for a one-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nBeyler's email to the hackers said the company was working \"very hard\" to review all the material they provided, and also trying to figure out a way to make a large transaction in bitcoin, the hackers' preferred payment method.\n\n\"You have the advantage of having surprised us,\" Beyler wrote. \"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, saying it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation.\n\nIn the breach, which became public July 31, hackers stole 1.5 terabytes of programming and internal communications. They have since posted scripts from several \"Game of Thrones\" episodes, including one that was unreleased, episodes of \"Ballers\" and \"Room 104,\" and a month's worth of emails appearing to be from Leslie Cohen, HBO's vice president for film programming.\n\nInternal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives, also were released. The hackers have demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nWhether or not HBO ever intended to follow through with its $250,000 offer, the email raised questions Friday among security professionals about the importance of the data as well as how it will affect future attacks.\n\n\"It's interesting that they're spinning it as a bug bounty program,\" said Pablo Garcia, CEO of FFRI North America, based in Aliso Viejo, California. \"They're being extorted. If it was a bug bounty, it'd be on the up and up.\"\n\nHBO has said that it is working with law enforcement and cybersecurity firms to investigate the attack, which is the latest to hit a Hollywood business.\n\nThe leaks so far have fallen well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014. In April, a hacker claimed to have released episodes of Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" ahead of their official launch date.\n\nBut paying ransoms to hackers can be dangerous because it shows that being a bad-guy hacker is a good business, said cybersecurity expert Oren Falkowitz, CEO of Redwood City, California-based Area 1 Security. Companies would be better off investing in preventing email spear-fishing attempts and other hacking techniques, he said.\n\n\"The reason they got in this scenario is they didn't have the right pre-emption strategy,\" Falkowitz said. \"The next company, whether it's Showtime or Death Row Records or whomever, needs to see that they're going to wake up one day to this reality unless they confront it.\"", "timeCrawl": "20:34:00", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 200, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 207}, {"textStart": 1132, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1139}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8696952", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter report receiving an email from the hackers containing a transcript of a message sent by HBO offering payment.\n\nIn that message, an HBO executive reportedly writes, \"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\" HBO declined to comment to both publications, but Variety says it was able to confirm that the email was real.\n\nVariety says the email may have been a stalling tactic, as the email was sent in late July before HBO had fully assessed the extent of the hack. That means it's unclear if HBO actually would have gone through with paying the hackers, but it's still surprising even to see the offer be made.\n\nThus far, companies have largely declined to negotiate with hackers, in part for fear of setting a precedent of paying them off. While HBO may have had no intention of paying, it's unusual to see such a huge corporation engaging with a hacker at all.\n\nEvidently, the payment was never made, and the hackers seem to either be looking for substantially more or to simply embarrass HBO. The Hollywood Reporter says it received an email from the hackers a week ago saying that \"it's just about money. We have weeks of negotiations with HBO officials, but they broke their promises and want to play with us.\"", "timeCrawl": "22:37:00", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8499266", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "id": 343, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 6, "liCnt": 31}}

In its email, the hackers also said that it in total it had obtained 1.5 TB of data by breaking into the computer networks of the firm.\n\nAfter investigating the cyber attack, Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab said that this sort of attack on HBO was a new sort of phenomena. According to them, the hackers in the 90s aimed at destroying the material rather than generating some revenue from this. The firm further reported that the main purpose behind this kind of an attack would be to garner the attention and to be in the news for a longer duration.\n\nHacking into HBO and taking away one of the most watched series - \"Game of Thrones\" is also claimed to be the most dreadful cyber attack in the security system. After the shows were hacked, the employees of the company also feared that their personal data might have been hacked or monitored, but the company denied such a notion. As per some reports, a security contractor which was hired by HBO to research more on the leaked data from Google revealed that the hacker got thousands of internal documents including the shows, scripts and unreleased episodes of Ballers and Room 104 - the other shows of HBO.\n\nThe cyber attack has been a massive and the unaired shows without censorship are now available on the various downloading sites; which have already got thousands of downloads on them. Being a free space, the company cannot do much about the leaked content but is thoroughly investigating into the entire matter.

Game of Thrones content reportedly stolen in HBO data hack\n\nHackers using the name \"Mr. Smith\" have posted a fresh cache of stolen HBO files online, and demanded the network pay a ransom of several million dollars to prevent further such releases.\n\nThe data dump included what appeared to be scripts from five Game of Thrones episodes, including one upcoming episode, and a month's worth of emails from the account of HBO's vice-president for film programming, Leslie Cohen.\n\nThere were also internal documents, including a report of legal claims against the network and job offer letters to top executives.\n\nHBO, which previously acknowledged the theft of \"proprietary information,\" said it was continuing to investigate and was working with police and cybersecurity experts.\n\nThe network has repeated its earlier assertion that it did not believe its entire email system had been compromised.\n\nThis is the second data dump from the purported hacker.\n\nSo far the HBO leaks have been limited, falling well short of the chaos inflicted on Sony in 2014.\n\nIn that attack, hackers unearthed thousands of embarrassing emails and released personal information, including salaries and social security numbers, of nearly 50,000 current and former Sony employees.\n\nThose behind the HBO hack claimed to have more data, including scripts, upcoming episodes of HBO shows and movies, and information damaging to HBO.\n\nIn a swaggering five-minute video directed to HBO chief executive officer Richard Plepler, \"Mr Smith\" used white text on a black background to threaten further disclosures if HBO does not pay up.\n\nIn short -- pay up within three days or the group, which claimed to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of HBO shows and confidential corporate data, would upload entire series and sensitive proprietary files.\n\nThe hackers claimed it took about six months to breach HBO's network.\n\nTheir biggest threat appears to be dumping videos of future shows online with their logo \"HBO Is Falling\" superimposed.\n\nThe hackers demanded \"our 6-month salary in bitcoin,\" and claimed they earnt $12 million to $15 million a year from blackmailing organisations whose networks they had penetrated.\n\nThey said they would only deal directly with \"Richard\" and only send one \"letter\" detailing how to pay.\n\nThe dump itself was just 3.4 gigabytes, mostly technical data that appears to provide a topography of HBO's network and to list network-administrator passwords.\n\nMany of the more than 50 internal documents in the dump were labelled \"confidential,\" including a spreadsheet of legal claims against the network, job offer letters to several top executives, slides discussing future technology plans and a list of 37,977 emails called \"Richard's Contact list,\" an apparent reference to Mr Plepler.\n\nOne screenshot labelled \"Highly Confidential\" by the hackers listed folders such as \"Penguin Random House,\" ''Licensing & Retail,\" ''Legal,\" ''International\" and \"Budgets\".\n\nAnother document appears to contain the confidential cast list for \"Game of Thrones,\" listing personal phone numbers and email addresses for actors such as Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey and Emilia Clark.\n\nThe video letter uploaded claimed the hackers spend half a million dollars a year to purchase \"zero-day\" exploits that let them break into networks through holes not yet know to Microsoft and other software companies.\n\nIt claims HBO is the hackers' 17th target and that only three of their past targets refused to pay.", "timeCrawl": "05:29:00", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8747342", "categories": [{"uri":

According to the reports, this is actually a part of their program that awards \"white hat IT professionals\".\n\nAccording to Variety, they were able to obtain a copy of the latest message last Thursday, since they were included in the list of select journalists with whom the hackers communicated with. The HBO Hacker forwarded a message from HBO that was sent to them last July 27.\n\nThe message was reportedly sent by an executive of the Time Warner -owned company and was strategically written in a non-confrontational tone. This was done in the hopes that this could stall the situation and give them more time as they continue to investigate what happened. The Variety mentioned that their source worked closely with the investigation and confirmed the authenticity of the email. The $250,000 payment was also done in the hopes that it would be satisfy the demands of the HBO hacker and possibly avoid more leaks from this major data breach.\n\nAn extension for the deadline of payment of the ransom was also requested by HBO. The message mentioned that the HBO hacker had the advantage of surprising the company and in the \"spirit of professional cooperation\" they sought an extension of one week. This way, they can prepare the $250,000 payment and the correct amount that can be secured in Bitcoin.\n\nIn their original video letter, the HBO hacker demanded a ransom worth six month's of their salary. They further claimed that they can make about $12 to $15 million per year.\n\nAccording to Washington Post, HBO disclosed the hacking incident last July 31. The HBO Hacker who calls himself Mr. Smith, was able to gain access to 1.5 terabytes worth of data. This included scripts and videos of highly anticipated shows like Ballers, Insecure, Game of Thrones, and even emails and other internal documents from the network.\n\nSecurity experts are still determining the extent of the security breach and what other materials have been compromised.\n\nMeanwhile, HBO has declined to comment on the latest message that was sent by their hackers.", "timeCrawl": "10:33:00", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 574, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 581}, {"textStart": 1751, "date": "2017-07-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1758}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8591593", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

As per Entertainment Weekly, the episode scored 10.2 million viewers for its debut airing on Sunday night at 9 p.m. Perhaps the leak didn't affect the ratings of the show thanks to loyal fans!

While whoever is behind the breach has been demanding a hefty ransom, a newly leaked email reveals that the broadcaster originally tried to buy them off with a $250,000 bug bounty.\n\nNews of the hack, and subsequent data dumps, was initially confirmed by HBO last Monday. This email, obtained by Variety, is dated the 27th July, offering the hackers a $250,000 'bounty payment' \"as part of a program in which 'white hat IT professionals' are rewarded for bringing these types of things to our attention.\"\n\nBug bounties are not uncommon, particularly in the tech industry, since they encourage benevolent (aka 'white hat') hackers to find and report security holes or exploits in exchange for cash rewards. That way the company can fix the problem before any malevolent individuals try and take advantage of them for whatever reason.\n\nAccording to sources speaking with Variety, it seems as though the message was likely a way to stall while the broadcaster assessed the situation. The email also implored the hackers to extend their deadline by a single week, in order to secure right amount of Bitcoin. This implies that this was always a ransom situation from the get go, though someone at HBO clearly hoped $250,00 would be enough to avoid major leaks - and avoid ending up like Sony and Netflix.\n\nApparently the hacker/hackers wanted \"six months salary\", while claiming to have earned between $12 million and $15 million last year. $250,000 was quite a bit less than that, which HBO no doubt knew at the time.\n\nVariety doesn't appear to have published the email in question, and HBO has reportedly refused to comment on the story.

The request prompted an automated response that provided a link to an image of the July 27 note from HBO.\n\nA person familiar with HBO's response to the attack told Reuters that the company sent the email \"as a stall tactic\" and had never intended to make the $250,000 payment or pay the full $6 million the hackers had demanded to hold off going public with data stolen from HBO.\n\nNonetheless, the email failed to achieve that goal. A few days after HBO sent the note, the hackers went to the media with details of the breach.\n\nThey released an extortion note and some stolen data, including details about an upcoming episode of the network's popular drama \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nVariety earlier reported details about the $250,000 offer.

The fourth episode of Game of Thrones season seven had also landed online ahead of its August 6 premiere.

Not only did the hackers obtain unreleased episodes of series like Ballers, Room 104, and Insecure, they obtained script materials for upcoming episodes of Game of Thrones, as well as the personal information of HBO employees. It's unclear just how massive the breach was, and the hackers have threatened to release more of the information in the near future.\n\nRelated: Leaked Game of Thrones Episode Still Broke Ratings Record\n\nHBO is attempting to take measures to prevent further fallout. Per Variety, the cable network has offered the hackers a $250,000 ransom payment. The email, which was leaked by the hackers, suggests HBO would pay the hackers through a \"white hat\" program, where they reward IT professionals for helping them find holes in their security. The $250,000 is decidedly less than the hackers are demanding, and their leak of the email would seem to suggest a rejection of HBO's terms. A source close to the investigation suggests the email was a stalling tactic so HBO can figure out just how serious the situation is. This all comes at a terrible time for HBO's parent company, Time Warner, who are currently in the process of attempting to merge with AT&T, which would create one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world. As they attempt to gain regulatory approval for the move, this kind of high profile crisis is the last thing they want.\n\nIt's impossible not to compare this situation to the Sony leak of 2014. Provoked by The Interview, a Seth Rogen/James Franco movie lampooning North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, a North Korean sponsored hacker group breached Sony's security, obtaining the personal information of countless Sony employees, as well as thousands of emails that embarrassed many high-profile Hollywood players, including Sony executive Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin. It also detailed the studio's behind the scenes troubles with the Spider-Man franchise and the runaway budget on Spectre.\n\nIt's unclear what the HBO hackers' motivations are at this point. It's also unclear how much damage they're capable of inflicting, and how much damage they intend to inflict. All we know for sure at this point is HBO is taking the situation seriously and is attempting to mitigate their exposure to a potentially devastating breach.\n\nNEXT: HBO Hack Leaks Game of Thrones Scripts\n\nSource: Variety\n\nShareOn Facebook Tweet Share Email Share Share Pin It Share Comment ThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!

Scripts from shows such as \"Game of Thrones\" were leaked online ahead of Sunday's episode. A hacker or group called \"Mr. Smith\" claimed responsibility and said they had around 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO.\n\nThe hackers demanded money worth six months of their salary, claiming they make $12 million to $15 million from stealing intellectual property and blackmailing companies. Those hackers appear to have been engaged in email correspondence with HBO.\n\nIn the message dated July 27, an IT employee said the company has been \"working hard\" since July 23 and asked the hackers to extend their ransom deadline, before making an offer.\n\n\"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin,\" the email read, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nCNBC has verified the email.\n\nThe HBO employee has been careful about wording.

Latest materials leaked include the draft script of a few unaired episodes and contracts of cast members, including Daenerys portrayer herself, Emilia Clarke.\n\nUnknown hackers have released 3.4-gigabyte of files out of the 1.5-terabyte HBO data that they claimed stolen. The group of hackers, calling themselves Mr Smith, has released a five-minute video letter to HBO chief executive Richard Plepler demanding to pay their sixth months' worth of salary in bitcoin within three days to cease the illicit unveiling of the rest of the stolen data.\n\nThe group has claimed they are earning US$12m to US$15m a year from breaching data of organisations. Part of the released 3.4-gigabyte of files includes Game of Thrones season 7's draft scripts from five unaired episodes and cast members' contracts, HBO's internal network and administrator passwords and a month's worth of emails from the network's vice president for film programming Leslie Cohen.\n\nGame of Thrones season 7's confidential cast list includes the personal landline numbers and email addresses of actors such as Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage. Meanwhile, many internal documents marked as \"confidential\" were also released, divulging job offer letters to several top executives, a spreadsheet of legal disputes against HBO, slides detailing the network's future technology plans and a list of almost 40,000 emails called \"Richard's Contact List\".\n\nHBO, however, denies that its email system in its entirety is in danger, conceding that \"propriety information\" has been stolen. The network says it is working hand in hand with authorities and cyber security experts to track down the people behind Mr Smith.\n\nAccording to the hackers, it took them six months to break into HBO's network, adding that they are expending US$500,000 a year to declare zero-day exploits which give hackers the open gateway to breach networks. This gateway, as they claimed, has not been known yet to Microsoft and other software firms.", "timeCrawl": "11:02:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8596941", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Vendors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Vendors", "id": 970, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Networking", "id": 972, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

One of those could be a lie.\n\nWith HBO's hack, it's becoming harder to separate fact from fiction.\n\nThe company was hit in a massive cyberattack, which the thieves claimed took six months of planning. Information slowly started to trickle out last month as the hackers threatened to release unaired episodes of \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Ballers\" and \"Barry,\" as well as documents with financial records and internal operations.\n\nHacks against media companies are becoming the latest trend for cybercriminals, who are lured by their weak security and massive payouts. The hackers see value in popular TV shows and the measures that media companies will take to prevent them from being spoiled for legions of fans. HBO's hackers pointed out that \"Game of Thrones\" spent $5 million for advertising, and wanted a cut.\n\nOn Monday night, the cybercrooks posted a script for an episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" along with a demand: pay up, or have more of your secrets leaked.\n\nOne of those secrets was a contacts list that appeared to belong to HBO Chairman and CEO Richard Pleper, the hackers threatened. But a person familiar with the investigation confirmed to CNET that the document is most likely forged. Variety first reported the phony file on Tuesday night.\n\nThe file, named \"Richard Contact list.txt,\" has email addresses from thousands of HBO and Time Warner staffers, but was renamed from its original version, \"Vivianne Contact list,\" the source said. The contacts and the document are real, but the file appears to have been doctored to look like it was the CEO's contact list instead of another executive's.\n\nHBO declined to comment beyond the statement it released on Monday, in which the company said it had no \"reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nIf the contacts document is altered, it calls into question the other 1.5 terabytes of data the hackers claim to have.

Scripts from shows such as \"Game of Thrones\" were leaked online ahead of Sunday's episode. A hacker or group called \"Mr Smith\" claimed responsibility and said they had around 1.5 terabytes of data from HBO.\n\nThe hackers demanded money worth six months of their salary, claiming they make between $12 million to $15 million from stealing intellectual property and blackmailing companies.\n\nNow those hackers have leaked details of their correspondence with HBO and both Variety and The Hollywood Reporter obtained a company of the email.\n\nIn the message dated July 27, an executive said the company has been \"working hard\" since July 23 and asked the hackers to extend their ransom deadline, before making an offer.\n\n\"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin,\" the email read, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nVariety said it had confirmed the veracity of the email.\n\nAcquiring $250,000 is not easy and could take some time, which is one reason the HBO exec, who both publications chose not to name, asked for a deadline extension.\n\nBut the executive has also chosen their words carefully. Instead of referring to a ransom, they have used the term \"bug bounty payment.\" This phrase refers to a reward paid by a company to good hackers for finding flaws in their system. Many technology companies have bug bounty programs in which they reward good hackers for finding security holes.\n\nHBO has not yet responded to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\n\nRead the full Hollywood Reporter and Variety articles.", "timeCrawl": "08:23:00", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 802, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 809}, {"textStart": 871, "date": "2017-07-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 878}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8567627", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "id": 596, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "id": 610, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Screenwriting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Screenwriting", "id": 1403, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 6, "liCnt": 205}}

This also raises questions about some of the hackers' other claims, and their interactions with the media.\n\nAfter first leaking some un-aired episodes of HBO shows like \"Ballers\" and \"Barry\" last week, the hackers sent emails to a number of news outlets early Tuesday to direct them to a new stash of leaked documents. The newly-leaked data included a file named \"Richard Contact list.txt\" that contained thousands of email addresses, suggesting that the hackers may have been able to steal Plepler's email address book.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is not the case. The file in question only contains email addresses from within HBO and Time Warner, including those of thousands of employees. There's not a single email for anyone from outside of the company -- curious for what's supposed to be the address book of a renowned industry power player like Plepler.\n\nWhat's more, the list also includes addresses for dozens of internal test accounts, email addresses for HBO's most popular shows, addresses for payroll and other HR matters and email addresses used to reserve conference rooms -- also not something one would expect a CEO to deal with.\n\nTo complicate matters even further, a source close to the investigation told Variety that the file was actually renamed by the hackers before it got sent to the press. The original version, as it was stolen from HBO's servers, was called \"Vivianne Contact list,\" according to that source.\n\nApparently, it was part of some files that originally belonged to another senior HBO executive who also had seen passwords to many of her personal online accounts leaked last week. It's unclear why this executive had the list in her possession, but it doesn't seem to be her email address book either.\n\nRenaming a single file may seem like a smaller detail in the grander scheme of things, but it does raise some important questions about the trustworthiness of the hackers, and the way the media should engage with them. Since the beginning of last week, the hackers have actively reached out to the press to give journalists their version of the story. This included claims that they had stolen a total of 1.5 terabyte of data, accessed internal email and other sensitive documents, and worked for half a year on the hack.\n\nHBO meanwhile has kept quiet on details of the hack. The network acknowledged last week that it had incurred a breach, and on Monday sent out the following statement: \"HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised.\"", "timeCrawl": "23:38:00", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8081319", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "id": 66, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "id": 306, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "id": 1057, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"gpCnt": 3, "liCnt": 20}}

In the hack, facts have been publicized and lots of data had been compromised. These included scripts, employees' personal information, and never-before-released episodes of shows.\n\nAt first, there was no definite cause explicitly stated for the hack, leading most people to believe that these are just #hackers doing their thing: having fun stealing private and well-guarded information. Yet recently, in light of a ransom video reported to be from the hackers themselves, the purpose was revealed: they want HBO to pay a ransom, or they leak more data, with the looming threat of suffering more hackings in the future.\n\nThe value of the ransom itself was censored on the public video (represented by \"XXXX dollars\"). Presumably, they have sent a private version of the letter to HBO where the amount is actually specified. According to a report by The Verge, the video was a 5-minute affair and was published at the entertainment website Mashable. It was addressed to Richard Plepler, an HBO CEO.\n\nThe video itself claims to be from a \"Mr. Smith,\" who says that they had access to HBO networks for quite some time now. In their six-month effort, they claimed to have stolen 1.5 terabytes of data.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the term, a terabyte is roughly equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes of data. While the bulk of information stolen would be in media assets -- audio, video, and images that can eat up a lot of space -- this is still a lot considering there will be information in text files as well.\n\nOther than these details, the rest of the video seemed lighthearted; one can even say that the hackers are aiming for ironic comedy. They sprinkled pop culture references everywhere, and even self-referenced the fact that they did an amateur mixing and editing of the video (\"We are hackers so accept our apology for amateur mixing!\").\n\nThe video concluded with a crudely-edited picture of The Night King, an iconic villain on the popular show \"Game of Thrones.

Hanging over HBO now is the daily threat of leaks of sensitive information, ranging from show content to actors' and executives' personal information.\n\nThe hack at HBO comes almost three years after a high-profile one at Sony Corp. and highlights persistent vulnerabilities unique to the entertainment industry. The pressing issue isn't safeguarding credit-card numbers and account details. Instead, executives are worried about potential damage to intellectual property if television-show spoilers are made available before episodes are officially aired.\n\n\"Hollywood is under siege,\" said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy for cybersecurity company Sentinel One. \"It seems easy to hack a network, and they perceive that they can make money doing so.\"\n\nAlready, scripts of \"Game of Thrones\" episodes have been leaked by the hackers, whose leader calls himself \"Mr. Smith.\" Also made public were episodes of other shows, including comedies \"Ballers\" and \"Insecure,\" and a month's worth of emails from an executive.\n\nWhen the hackers came forward late last month, an HBO technology-department employee sent them a letter offering $250,000 to participate in the company's \"bug bounty\" program, in which technology professionals are compensated for finding vulnerabilities, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nHBO was buying time with that response and isn't in negotiations with the hackers, the person said. The hacker has demanded a ransom of around $6 million.\n\nThe network has also been working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law-enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms to address the matter, people familiar with the matter say.\n\nMeanwhile, the cable network is playing Whac-A-Mole. It managed to take down the website and digital locker the hacker initially used to distribute show material after sending takedown notices to internet-service providers, according to the person familiar with the matter. It alerted potentially exposed \"Game of Thrones\" cast members of the hack before Mr. Smith posted material that includes some of their phone numbers.\n\nIn a statement, HBO Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Plepler said, \"The consensus here was a path to transparency. When something like this happens, the best you can do is try to protect the people you work with inside and outside the company. That's what our focus has been.\"\n\nUnlike retailers, entertainment firms usually don't shoulder the burden of protecting customer-account details, because that is handled by cable, satellite and web-TV distributors.\n\nThe urgent worry is that fewer viewers will watch episodes that can cost several million dollars each if hackers supply a stream of spoilers. That hasn't happened yet. The last \"Game of Thrones\" episode, which aired on Aug. 6 attracted a record 10.2 million viewers.\n\nThe fear also relates to the chance of emails emerging that could hurt relations with talent or other companies. In the Sony hack, then-studio chief Amy Pascal was embarrassed by emails in which she made a joke about President Barack Obama's taste in movies as well as disparaging remarks about actors, including Adam Sandler.\n\n\"Leakage will be your worst nightmare; your competitors will know about current & future strategies, your inner circle inside HBO & senior staff will be thrown into chaos,\" the hackers promised in a video note to Mr. Plepler they posted earlier this week.\n\nHBO has said it expects more information to leak out but said its review of the matter \"has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nAfter the Sony hack, many entertainment companies, including HBO's parent Time Warner Inc., beefed up their own security.\n\nAround the same time, though, in a cost-saving move, Time Warner centralized much of the technology operations that previously existed in the individual units, which also include Turner and Warner Bros.\n\nNow that strategy is being rethought, and the individual units are being encouraged to take on more autonomy and responsibility for their own technology infrastructure, the person familiar with the matter said.\n\nPrior to the HBO hack, sister unit Turner Broadcasting had already begun the process of overhauling some of its information technology after an assessment revealed that a hack into one network, such as Cartoon Network, could easily be a gateway into CNN.\n\nThe HBO hack also comes as Time Warner is in the process of being acquired by AT&T Inc. However, the hack isn't expected to have any effect on the sale or the terms of the deal, according to media analyst Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson Research. An AT&T spokesman declined to comment.\n\nCybersecurity expert Mr. Grossman, who has tested security networks for Hollywood TV and movie companies, said these firms are vulnerable because they work with so many partners that \"their data is all over the place.\"\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "timeCrawl": "11:01:00", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 3119, "date": "2017-08-06", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3125}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8596875", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "id": 1085, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 9}}

The \"good faith\" $250,000 \"bounty payment\" offered by an HBO IT exec on July 27 to the hacker, in a correspondence revealed Thursday, is obviously way below the initial ask.\n\nThe borderline form letter thanking the hacker \"for bringing these types of things to our attention\" was in fact not even a genuine offer, a source familiar with the situation at HBO tells Deadline.

Nor have there been any big reveals for the Emmy winning blockbuster or Richard Plepler's correspondence, despite a misleading and likely manipulated email address that was said to come from the HBO boss.\n\nWorking with law enforcement and tech specialists, HBO has been pretty circumspect the past few days about the hack.

Early reports suggested the online attack was worse than the Sony hack, but the premium-cable network tried to downplay the extent of the data breach, even as the hacker or hackers issued more threats. Then the Unsullied -- we mean, the FBI -- got involved. Then came that \"Spoils Of War\" leak, followed by more threats, then some reassurances, and finally, the revelation that these hackers might be overstating their data bounty. The latest development suggests that the hack's real and real extensive, as The Daily Beast has just published an email in which an HBO employee uses some cajoling language to offer the hackers $250,000 to lay off already.\n\nThe full text is over at The Daily Beast site, which has yet to hear back from HBO about the email it obtained. But it's clear that the person who wrote it wanted to mollify the hackers, who are never referred to by that term in the message.

Netflix. And now, HBO.\n\nWhile the 2014 hacking at Sony Pictures pushed entertainment giants to take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain. Last week, as HBO investigated a cyberattack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show \"Game of Thrones\" appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix's \"Orange Is the New Black\" leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nIn sum, the problems are afflicting media that lean most on consumers for revenue -- and the ones where people enjoy a lack of ad interruptions.\n\nHollywood is especially vulnerable to cybercrime because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognize this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal email accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Ballers,\" a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's emails and a summary of an unaired episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" according to Variety.\n\nAfter receiving a ransom demand, an HBO executive emailed the hacker on July 27 offering $250,000 as payment for finding a security flaw, according to a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg. HBO asked the hacker to extend the deadline for a week while the company arranged a payment in bitcoin. That was a stalling effort, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Variety reported on the email earlier.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire email system, CEO Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner, declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theaters loses 19 percent of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favorite shows and movies online for free.\n\nRansom demands\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: Should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back?\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea.\n\n\"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about $50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like 'Game of Thrones' and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for \"The Interview,\" a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former CEO of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\"", "timeCrawl": "20:59:00", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2254, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2261}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8700086", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 3}}

The wildly popular original content maker was just the latest entertainment company to be hit by hackers who have extended their interest beyond hitting expected targets like financial institutions.\n\nThe breach of HBO, along with the theft of content like Orange is the New Black and Steve Harvey's Funderdome earlier this year, shows a newfound focus from cyber vandals on intellectual property that should result in organizations in many different fields shoring up their security.\n\nRead: HBO Hack: Lastest Leak Includes Emails, Actor Contact Information\n\nAccording to the hackers who apparently carried out the sustained effort to break into HBO's systems, the reason for the hack wasn't driven by \"political or financial\" motivations -- though the group did demand millions of dollars to put a stop to its leaks. Instead, the group would have HBO believe the attack was carried out just to see if it could be done.\n\nHBO's reward for warding off the hackers, known as little.finger66, for nearly six months before the group finally breached the company's defenses is leak after leak of valuable data. Thus far, the hackers have released full episodes of shows, scripts, internal documents and contact information of actors on the HBO series Game of Thrones.\n\n\"This incident shows hackers will target any kind of information - even entertainment programming,\" Ebba Blitz, CEO of AlertSec told International Business Times. \"All information is vulnerable because some hackers are motivated by the thrill of it. They steal because they can, not because the information always has any real long-term value.\"\n\nIt's not known exactly how the group breached HBO's databases. The closest hint the hackers have provided came in a video letter attached to a leak of company documents and communications in which the group claimed to penetrate HBO's \"internal network and other related platforms.\"\n\nRead: HBO Hack Update: Hackers Threaten More Leaks, Every Week, Starting Sunday\n\nFilip Chytr\u00fd, threat intelligence expert at cyber security company Avast, said there are three likely options the hackers could have exploited to break into HBO's databases: \"by targeting IoT devices connected to HBO's internal network that could communicate externally, by finding vulnerabilities in HBO's infrastructure or by creating a scam campaign to trick HBO employees into exposing or opening up a vulnerability.\"\n\nWhile scam campaigns, typically carried out using phishing emails designed to get a victim to download a malicious file or surrender login credentials, are commonly the cause of data breaches, HBO has provided no indication an employee fell victim to such an attack. The company has also publicly claimed its email servers were not breached.\n\nThat doesn't exclude the possibility, and organizations like HBO should always aim to improve best security practices of employees by educating its workforce. Some companies have even taken to preemptively phishing its own employees to raise awareness of such attacks. \"A human behind the computer screen is always the biggest security vulnerability,\" Chytry said.\n\nAs for IoT devices, more security experts are beginning to point to those internet-connected products as potential weak points in security networks. While the devices are connected to the company's internal network, they also share data with external sources and many have less-than-adequate built-in security protocols.\n\nWhile the United States government has taken to trying to tighten security requirements for internet-connected products, many still come equipped with an easily guessable default password that make the devices sitting ducks for an attacker. Every unsecure device on a network is a potential point of entry for a hacker.\n\nFerruh Mavituna, CEO of security firm Netsparker, suggested the attack may have been directed at web applications used by HBO. While Mavituna noted he had no direct insight into the HBO case, he said \"the biggest cause of recent data breaches were web application hacks, and more specifically SQL Injection vulnerabilities.\"\n\nSuch an attack can be especially troubling for an organization, as it means either an application the company built or a third-party service it trusted was far less secure than believed. Mavituna advised using security scanners that can stress test such systems and potentially spot holes in the application.\n\nIf an organization is relying upon a third-party for that protection, the task can become trickier. There have been a number of instances in which third-party services, trusted with valuable information, leave that data exposed. Organizations should maintain a dialogue with the providers they work with to ensure steps are taken to secure valuable information.\n\nSanjay Beri, CEO of cloud security company Netskope, said it's important for organizations to \"safeguard data against misuse and theft by proactively implementing security technologies as a check.\" According to Beri, security measures such as access control and anomaly detection can \"significantly reduce the risk of costly breaches like this from happening in the future.\"\n\nOne thing that makes these efforts to secure data all the more challenging for HBO and other organizations is the increasingly sophisticated means of attacks used by hackers. Little.finger66 claimed to purchase zero day exploits -- security vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered and patched by software and hardware makers -- in order to carry out an attack.\n\nAs Sean Smith, the director of architecture for cybersecurity monitoring and rating platform SecurityScorecard, point out, zero day attacks add complexity to the effort to defend against hackers because the exploits are unknown until exploited.\n\n\"The fact that a zero day may have been involved makes protection tricky, as what looks like an up to date defended system actually has unknown holes,\" Smith said. \"Securing access to resources internally, rather than just at the perimeter would be the most mitigating defense for a scenario like this.\"\n\nThe use of such an exploit also suggests the attack wasn't a fly-by-night operation but rather a \"concentrated attack from a determined group,\" according to Smith.\n\nHe suggested HBO could add additional defenses such as two-factor authentication to its services to prevent unauthorized access from a compromised account. He also said the company could look at it \"network perimeter and logs\" to determine where the breach may have occurred.\n\nDefending systems will always be a bit of an uphill battle for organizations -- especially those who may not be conventional targets. Doing so requires investing time and resources into defenses -- systems that won't generate revenue and can be hard to justify when just looking at the bottom line, but are absolutely necessary to mitigate as much risk as possible.\n\nEven then, it's possible for those systems to be breached. When that happens, as it did in the case of HBO, just about every expert pointed to encryption as the last line of defense.\n\nAlertSec's Blitz said \"all data needs to be protected with encryption.\" Chytry from Avast offered similar advice, stating organizations, \"should have everything encrypted on hard drives, ensuring that anybody who has access has a unique decryption key.

Last week's episode, \"The Spoils of War,\" was the most-watched episode of Game of Thrones ever with 10.2 million live- and same-day viewers, based on Nielsen numbers. It broke the series's previous record of 10.1 million, held by its seventh-season opener.\n\nThat's also despite the full episode being posted online a few days early by a pay-TV provider in India, which received the episodes in advance. The episode was a particularly pivotal one; after six seasons, the dragons finally attacked in spectacular fashion.\n\nAnd these numbers don't include viewership across all platforms, including repeats and streaming and DVR, which amounted at 16.1 million for the season 7 premiere. Nor piracy.

(Related: The Westeros Economy)\n\nNow Variety and the Hollywood Reporter have acquired copies of an email dated July 27 sent by HBO to the hackers. The network has said it is \"working hard\" to review the material sent by the hackers and has asked for the ransom deadline to be extended as it scrambles to \"establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\"\n\nInterestingly, HBO refrains from calling the bitcoin payment a ransom. \"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin,\" said a company executive in the email.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have gained popularity with prominent mainstream investors and have soared into new price echelons. Nonetheless, there remain major concerns among potential investors about the security of these new asset types. Specifically, the anonymity built into the blockchain technology which supports all digital currencies has some people worried not only about the security of their own holdings, but also the potential ways in which criminal operations could take advantage. Now, one hacking group has done just that and dragged the world's most popular show into their web of malfeasance.\n\nThe report on the potential blackmail incident reveals that the team of hackers released a five-minute video (above) addressed to HBO CEO Richard Plepler. The speaker on the video was identified only as a \"Mr. Smith,\" and the video contained the demands and nature of the hack. The team indicated that they had worked for six months to access HBO's network and that they had eventually been successful in their attempts to secure draft scripts of Game of Thrones and emails from top executives at the network which contained sensitive information.\n\nSome highlights, since the video manifesto is long:\n\nAlso, we obtained full scripts and cast list of your (and our) very popular TV series; Game of thrones S7.\n\nYou concealed GOT7 very carefully so we can't find it due to lack of time although we are so close. Instead, we produced some tiny mini-series of GOT 7 for you which be able to shock the entire world!!!\n\nLeakage will be your worst nightmare; your competitors will know about your current & future strategies, your inner circle inside HBO & senior staff will be thrown into chaos, your views specially fans became very upset and they blame you rather than us!, downfall in stocks will be predictable and so on. As you are in the business from decades, you yourselves will be full aware of catastrophic consequences .... So make a wise decision!\n\nThe hackers seemed to treat the operation as a regular job of sorts: the video includes demands for a \"6-month salary in Bitcoin,\" and the team indicated that they would expect to make between $12 million and $15 million per year from similar activities. This suggests that the ransom demand would be for between $6 million and $7.5 million.\n\nYou pay our 6 month salary to bitcoin and we get away form your map. As we witnesses in other cases, F*ing FBI or other police enforcements, teach you couple of outdated trick to play with us and buy time. It doesn't work with us.\n\nDo the bitcoin job quick. Some banks in USA have problems in exchanging bitcoin and caused trouble in past. We don't accept sentences like: we want to pay but banks are lazy and don't cooperate. Its your problem. Give some bucks, they do like slaves.\n\nThe fact that transactions on the blockchain network are decentralized and anonymous means that criminal organizations like this one can conduct business and illegal activities without being monitored as closely by government officials. Nonetheless, the use of cryptocurrencies among criminal operations like this one remains low, according to Ross Wilson of Bitcoin exchange CoinCorner. \"If you look at reports...you will see that the amount of organized crime that use Bitcoin is actually much lower than perceived.\" Perhaps part of the reason that the public perception of the incidence of Bitcoin-related organized crime is so high is that the stories tend to be widely shared and highly publicized.\n\nAs of this writing, it is unclear how HBO will respond to the hackers' demands, or if they will respond at all. Details on the hacking incident are sparse as well, and it remains to be seen whether the hackers did, in fact, successfully access sensitive information.", "timeCrawl": "23:10:00", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 354, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 361}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8716757", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "id": 271, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Video", "id": 762, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

But with the introduction of pilfered emails, the network has fewer options to fight the spread.\n\n\"There are a lot of tools now to rapidly respond when something that violates copyright law pops up on the internet thanks to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\" says Nathaniel Gleicher, former director of cybersecurity policy for the Obama White House and ex-senior counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice's computer crimes division. \"With emails, it's not exactly clear.\"\n\nWith the first wave of dumps, HBO was able to play a game of whack-a-mole as unaired episodes of Ballers and Room 104 spread on the internet. But emails do not qualify as copyrighted material. HBO could still file a DMCA takedown with sites hosting stolen emails, but the whack-a-mole effort becomes exponentially more difficult because unlike video, which takes a long time to upload, emails are small and upload quickly, making them easy to spread.\n\nAn HBO spokesperson, in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, wrote: \"HBO believed that further leaks might emerge from this cyber incident when we confirmed it last week. As we said, the forensic review is ongoing. While it has been reported that a number of emails have been made public, the review to date has not given us a reason to believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised.\"\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident. Meanwhile, our dedicated employees continue to focus on delivering the high quality of entertainment and service for which we are known.\"\n\nThough the hackers have released emails from only one employee to date covering a 30-day period, they claim to have far more.

More disturbingly, the confidential data is said to include the addresses and phone numbers of the stars of \"Game of Thrones\" (pictured at Comic-Con), according to The Guardian.\n\nExplaining that his motivation was purely financial, Mr. Smith included a ransom demand with the latest data dump, which was released in the form of a scrolling video set to music from \"Game of Thrones\" itself. The video letter, which implied it was a reproduced copy of a letter sent directly to Plepler, demanded a redacted amount of money be paid as a ransom. Otherwise, Mr. Smith would continue to release more HBO material.\n\n\"Our demand is clear and Non-Negotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your Data,\" the letter demands. \"HBO spends 12 million for Market Research and 5 million for GOT7 advertisements. So consider us another budget for your advertisements!\" A copy of the video can be viewed on Mashable.\n\nIndustry experts were not surprised by the demands. Sydney Sloan, chief marketing officer at Alfesco Software Ltd., told SiliconANGLE that this is the start.\n\n\"This is the future of hacking and all companies that create content need to safeguard themselves from criminals and disgruntled employees, beyond securing their firewalls,\" Sloan said. \"For those of us who watch 'Game of Thrones' and shows much like it, the outcome is worse than spoilers.

One of the most famous leaked data were a couple of episodes of \"Game of Thrones\" which greatly affected the number of viewers per airing of the episode. Just recently, #hackers responsible for this leakage demanded a staggering sum as insurance. Details are as follows:\n\nIn another demonstration of disrespect - and violation of laws regarding illegal content distribution and fraud - the hackers responsible for last week leakage released another statement requesting about 6 to 7.5 millions in bitcoins, claiming that's only equivalent to their \"six-month income\".\n\nThe money would be an insurance so no more of the 1.5 terabytes stolen are released (among that, other than unprecedented episodes, are personal employees' information and confidential company issues).\n\nAlthough, even with the brand new 3.4 GB of data being released earlier yesterday, the company refuses to settle a deal with the hackers. This time, after a five-minute video demanding the payment, hackers claimed to possess personal information about employees - such as cellphone numbers from \"#Game of Thrones\" actors - emails, confidential information and also scripts for future filming, which would all be made available online for public viewing.\n\nDespite all the hackers' efforts to break the network defense and cause some kind of damage to performance in order to prove their point and receive millions in only three days, last Sunday's episode of \"Game of Thrones\" broke audience records - an important show of force and fidelity of true fans.\n\nAdditionally, #HBO maintains the same position: the company will not give in to threats - also mentioning the quantity of data stolen is a bluff from the North-Korean hacker linked group, in order to convince payment. It may seem too subtle and powerless sign, but the show also teaches uncommon plans are effective when it comes to war.\n\nFinally, the network seems to have payed attention to Daenerys Targaryen's reflection after all: What is the point of being queen, if after the war there is only ashes to rule? In other words - peace seems to be working well so far; meanwhile, HBO aims to conquer their final goal: the true love and live audience of the people and perhaps avoid the same circumstances to happen again.", "timeCrawl": "11:02:00", "sim": 0.5333333611488342, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8597068", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Insurance", "id": 101, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "id": 862, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain. Last week, as HBO investigated a cyber attack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show \"Game of Thrones\" appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix Inc.'s \"Orange Is the New Black\" leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nCyber crime is a growing problem for many industries, but Hollywood is especially vulnerable because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognize this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal email accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Ballers,\" a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's emails and a summary of an unaired episode of \"Game of Thrones,\" according to Variety.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire email system, Chief Executive Officer Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner Inc., declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theaters loses 19 percent of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favorite shows and movies online for free.\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: Should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back? A hacker released a video this week demanding that HBO pay up to avoid further disclosures.\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea.\n\n\"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about $50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like 'Game of Thrones' and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for \"The Interview,\" a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\"", "timeCrawl": "14:48:00", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8640241", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 10}}

A hacker released a video this week demanding that HBO pay up to avoid further disclosures.\n\nThe FBI says that's always a bad idea.\n\n\"We believe it perpetuates the crime in general,\" FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.\n\nThere's also no guarantee paying the ransom will work. In April, Netflix refused to pay a hacker who stole unreleased episodes of \"Orange Is the New Black.\" Larson Studios, which worked with Netflix, told Variety it paid the ransom, about $50,000, in bitcoin. The hacker, who went by the name TheDarkOverlord, dumped the stolen episodes online anyway.\n\nLarson Studios didn't respond to a request for comment, while a Netflix official said only that the company is \"constantly working to improve our security.\"\n\nIn another high profile case this year, hackers threatened to leak a stolen copy of Disney's new \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" if the company didn't pay a ransom. The company refused, and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said later he believed it was all a hoax.\n\nEven so, with millions of dollars at stake, some companies may decide paying is the best option, said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at the security firm McAfee Inc.\n\n\"If they got access to something like 'Game of Thrones' and I can pay them a couple million dollars to get that back, there's probably a good use case,\" he said.\n\nThe Sony attack, which embarrassed studio executives after private emails were made public, was linked by the FBI to North Korea, which allegedly was retaliating for \"The Interview,\" a film about a fictional plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong Un. Some studios have reportedly removed Russian President Vladimir Putin as a character in films because they're concerned they'll suffer a similar fate.\n\nSony has learned from that attack. Michael Lynton, former chief executive officer of Sony Entertainment, started transferring emails off his computer every 10 days.\n\n\"To me, that's the solution,\" Lynton said at event hosted by Lerer Hippeau Ventures in May. \"Put it in a drawer and lock the drawer.\"", "timeCrawl": "13:01:00", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8618607", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "id": 107, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Netflix. And now, HBO. While the 2014 hacking at Sony Pictures pushed entertainment giants to take computer security more seriously, recent incidents have exposed weaknesses throughout Hollywood's food chain.\n\nLast week, as HBO investigated a cyberattack on its own systems, an unaired episode of its hit show Game of Thrones appeared online following an unrelated breach at a pay-TV partner in India. In April, when 10 episodes of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black leaked, the incident was traced to a contractor.\n\nCybercrime is a growing problem for many industries, but Hollywood is especially vulnerable because of the long chain of people who work on a show or movie in post-production, experts say. Studios rely on an army of freelancers for everything from special effects to musical scores, creating a vast network of targets for hackers. Bringing those workers in-house is an option but would be expensive and could limit the talent studios can tap.\n\n\"Hollywood will have to recognise this will continue to grow and be an issue,\" said Mike Orosz, who studies cyber risk as research director at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute.\n\nHBO requires employees to have two-factor authentication and strong passwords for their computers. They also undergo security awareness training. But the company works with many post-production freelancers that handle sensitive information on personal e-mail accounts and personal devices, raising security concerns, according to a former employee who asked not to be identified discussing an internal matter.\n\n\"Once the content is out of your hands, it's truly out of your hands,\" Orosz said. \"The security of the third-party vendor is what you're relying on.\"\n\nHBO is still investigating how hackers broke into its computer system. They stole episodes of Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm and Ballers, a person familiar with the matter said at the time. They also stole an executive's e-mails and a summary of an unaired episode of Game of Thrones, according to Variety.\n\nThe hackers don't appear to have breached the company's entire e-mail system, CEO Richard Plepler told staff last week. The network, owned by Time Warner, declined to make any additional comment.\n\nFor Hollywood, hackers are threatening both reputations and businesses. A stolen movie that appears online before appearing in theaters loses 19% of its box-office revenue on average compared with films that are pirated after they're released, according to a study by professors at University of Maryland and Carnegie Mellon University. People may not be willing to subscribe to Netflix or HBO if they can watch their favourite shows and movies online for free.\n\nWhat's more, the wave of attacks is forcing media executives to confront a thorny question: should they pay ransoms to hackers to get their content back?

As previously reported, HBO and its hit series, Game of Thrones, were recently subject to massive data breaches. One breach saw a recent episode of the show get leaked online early before its scheduled airdate. However, the episode leak was reportedly not related to the leak which saw HBO's servers get hacked.\n\nThe Time Warner-owned premium channel sent a message to the hacker in response to an initial video letter where the hacker informed HBO of the company's massive data breach.\n\nThe message sent by HBO is dated July 27, and it features an offer from the network to make a payment of $250,000 as part of a program for \"white hat IT professionals\" getting rewarded rewarded for \"bringing these types of things to our attention.\" The report says a source close to the investigation confirmed the e-mail is real. However, the reason the e-mail was worded in a tone that was non-confrontational is because HBO was trying to \"stall for time\" while the situation was being evaluated. Additionally, HBO tried to pen the possibility of a $250,000 payment to try and appease the hacker and avert a leak that could also impact other companies, including Sony and Netflix.\n\nAdditionally, the cable network's message to the hacker asked for an extension of the ransom-payment deadline for one week while the $250,000 payment is made and the necessary amount of bitcoins could be gathered. The message read, \"You have the advantage of having surprised us. In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\"\n\nPer the report, the hacker requested a ransom payment in a video letter of \"six months salary,\" and the hacker claims to have an annual income of $12 million to $15 million per year.

(Fred Prouser/Reuters)\n\nHBO, the producer of the most beloved televisual products the world has ever seen, has fallen victim to an attack from a group of cyber-criminals hoping to make a quick buck off of the company's misfortunes. If these villains are to fail in their effort, we -- news producers and news consumers alike -- are going to have to make a rather difficult choice: to simply ignore any illicitly obtained material released in the information dumps that follow.\n\nAs bits and pieces of information have dribbled out, the hackers claim to have stolen a phenomenal amount of data -- some 1.5 terabytes of it. Some of that data comes in the form of TV shows; the goons say they have obtained access to unaired episodes of programs such as \"Ballers\" and have portioned out little bits of supposed information about the network's crown jewel, \"Game of Thrones,\" as a sort of perverse proof of life.\n\nWhat might be even more damaging is that the criminals claim to have gained access to HBO's internal email servers. In a sort of warning shot, the hackers released a tiny percentage of the missives that they claim to have obtained -- supposedly including notes with personal contact information for \"Game of Thrones\" actors and draft scripts from future episodes. HBO said in a statement Monday that it had no \"reason to believe that our e-mail system as a whole has been compromised\" and is still investigating the extent of the hack.\n\nIt's the emails, more than the episodes of TV, that would likely give HBO execs serious reason to consider paying off the hackers. The risk of lost revenue from the hack is probably minimal: I'm willing to bet that most people who watch HBO's hit programs will likely wait for the shows to debut on the network -- they already pay for the service and would prefer to watch the programs on real televisions rather than laptop screens in the company of others online, tweeting along in real time and reading recaps the next morning. HBO is one of the few channels left to offer true destination viewing, a real sense of community among fans.\n\nNo, as anyone who remembers the Sony hack from a few years back or the hack of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails during last year's presidential campaign will tell you, it's the emails that will keep executives up at night, the emails that will nudge them a lot further toward paying off the ransom than anything else. After all, who among us would want their personal, private business communications displayed for the world to see? Who would want people picking apart what we wrote and said about those we worked with and for? Who wants strangers sifting through their Amazon purchase history, as happened to Sony's Amy Pascal when the writers and editors at Gawker's Jezebel decided the world needed to know about the personal grooming products she purchased?\n\nThe simple fact of the matter is that this crime, like any other form of blackmail, relies on the potential of embarrassment for the victim for it to truly have any power. The financial damage the attack could do to HBO may be modest in comparison with the personal, reputational damage it could do to HBO employees. But that threat of blackmail really only works if we, the people, allow it to. If we reporters and writers dig through and highlight the salacious details; if you readers and news consumers share the grotesqueries uncovered.\n\nThis will take a rather remarkable amount of restraint on behalf of all involved -- indeed, it may be worth considering whether or not it's time for a sea change in norms when it comes to the media's role in promulgating stories. This is not a particularly tough case, as one could argue the Podesta email breach -- nominally a newsworthy dump about a powerful political figure executed in the name of \"transparency\"; more likely a cyberattack enabled by a foreign power in order to impact a domestic election -- was. It's not even like the recent avalanche of nude celebrity photos to hit the Web a couple of years back, which was a crime but an almost chaotic one, Joker-esque in its prurient randomness. The HBO breach is straightforward graft, an attempt to earn an enormous amount of money by circumventing any number of laws.\n\nAs such, it is incumbent upon us not to aid in the crime, to not serve as unwitting accomplices. Just don't look. Just don't share. And never forget: You could very easily be next.", "timeCrawl": "14:05:00", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8413004", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "id": 126, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "id": 459, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "id": 1010, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

A new email from the group claims HBO responded to the hacker's demands with one exec possibly working on securing a $250,000 payment in Bitcoin to possibly get the network's data back.", "timeCrawl": "16:34:00", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8661074", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "id": 62, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Storage", "id": 104, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "id": 690, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Instruments_and_Supplies/Laboratory_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Instruments and Supplies/Laboratory Equipment", "id": 781, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master_Data_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Master Data Management", "id": 782, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications", "id": 969, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It would appear that after an anonymous hacker got their hands on a massive amount of HBO data, including upcoming episodes of popular shows, HBO offered them a \"bounty payment.\" How do we know that? Because the same hacker leaked the memo, HBO sent.\n\nAccording to Variety, the message is dated July 27, and offers $250,000 to the hacker. The memo states that the money is part of a program involving \"white-hat IT professionals\" being rewarded for \"bringing these types of things to our attention.\" I guess putting out scripts for unreleased Game of Thrones episodes is one way to bring these issues to HBO's attention.\n\nVariety's sources tell them the memo was worded specifically to buy the network time. Rather than being confrontational, appearing to offer an olive branch allows HBO to fully assess the situation. The memo also asks that the ransom deadline set by the hacker be pushed back one week so the necessary amount of bitcoin may be secured.\n\nThe message reads, \"You have the advantage of having surprised us. In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\" While $250,000 in bitcoin is a lot of money to most people, it isn't nearly the amount the hacker originally demanded. In their initial video to HBO, they requested \"six months salary,\" claiming to make $12 million to $15 million per year.\n\nWhile the memo appears to be more of a stalling tactic than a serious offer, HBO really shouldn't be surprised that it got out. As there's no statement from the network yet, we have to assume they at least considered this as a possibility, right? Leakers gonna leak.

Two passenger trains collided Friday just outside Egypt's Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people, according to authorities, the country's deadliest rail accident in more than a decade.\n\nMagdy Hegazy, a top health official in Alexandria, said the crash also injured 122 people.\n\nThe Egyptian Railways Authority said earlier that a train coming from Cairo, Egypt's capital, crashed into the back of a train that was waiting at a small station in the district of Khorshid, just east of Alexandria.\n\nFriday's crash was the latest in a series of deadly accidents that have claimed hundreds of lives over the years. Figures recently released by the state's statistics agency show that 1,249 train accidents took place last year.\n\nHBO email offers money to hackers\n\nHackers this week released an email from HBO in which the company expressed willingness to pay them $250,000 as part of a negotiation over data swiped from HBO's servers.\n\nThe July 27 email was sent by John Beyler, an HBO executive who thanked the hackers for \"making us aware\" of previously unknown security vulnerabilities. The executive asked for a 1-week delay and said HBO was willing to make a \"good faith\" payment of $250,000, calling it a \"bug bounty\" reward for IT professionals rather than a ransom.\n\nHBO declined to comment. A person close to the investigation confirmed the authenticity of the email, but said it was an attempt to buy time and assess the situation. The same hackers have subsequently released two dumps of HBO material and demanded a multi-million dollar ransom.\n\nGang hit man gets life in Chicago\n\nA hit man for a Chicago street gang was sentenced to life in prison Friday, with the judge saying witnesses who testified against the Hobos enforcer during one of the city's biggest gang cases in years no longer have to worry he might one day come after them.\n\nParis Poe, 37, killed two government witnesses planning to testify against the gang, U.S. District Judge John Tharp said. The killings were meant to send a warning to potential witnesses, and it worked, Tharp said. One witness during the trial said he'd rather go to jail than testify.

HBO is only the latest victim, as thieves leaked emails and scripts from \"Game of Thrones\" and other HBO shows onto the web, promising to release more unless the network pays a hefty fee.\n\nA source close to the investigation said the hackers wanted $6 million to stop leaking \"Game of Thrones\" spoilers, episodes of \"Ballers,\" and various internal documents.\n\nThe attack marks an escalation of online threats for Hollywood studios, which previously were on the lookout for piracy, and for fans who'd post movies or shows online for others to watch for free. HBO is well aware of those issues. It had to deal with more than 10 million Americans who were planning on watching \"Game of Thrones\" illegally. But now the network and the rest of Hollywood are at greater risk, with cybercriminals targeting not just their shows but their internal documents too.\n\nThese aren't fanboys looking for the latest scoop on Jon Snow or Daenerys; they're in it for the money. Netflix found that out when hackers reportedly released a new season of \"Orange is the New Black\" after the streaming giant refused to pony up a ransom.\n\nWhy is it happening? A lot of companies don't think they'll be targets, and they skip common security practices.\n\n\"Most people prefer the ease of use over security, until it bites them,\" said Ross Rustici, the head of intelligence research at security company Cybereason.\n\nQuality vs. quantity\n\nCybercriminals are always looking for wealthy targets, and they've found a blockbuster hit with Hollywood. In 2015 and 2016, the main victims were hospitals and small businesses, who couldn't afford to have robust security. Hackers would steal data from a vast amount of computers, in the hope that smaller payouts from hundreds of thousands of victims would bring them a massive fortune. With movie studios, the job gets much easier.\n\n\"You're going to have to hit hundreds of thousands of people to make the same amount you would with one organization,\" said Rick Holland, vice president of strategy and a cybercrime researcher at cybersecurity company Digital Shadows.\n\nThe thieves are aiming for quality now, not quantity, and with Hollywood studios, especially those with massive fan bases, there's a lot of potential for payments.\n\nMovie studios are taking note. Holland said several media companies hit by hackers in the last two years secretly paid a ransom to keep the hacks under wraps. It's become so prevalent that he's seen media companies set up bitcoin wallets in case they're the next victim.\n\nAs more movie studios opt to pay up, they increasingly become a target. That's why the FBI and most cybersecurity organizations recommend that you don't pay criminals, because it will only encourage future attacks.\n\nStudios are inclined to pay hackers if it means saving them at the box office and saving their ratings. It's worse for movies than for TV shows. With a film, studios can pour millions of dollars into a single project only to see it get leaked.\n\nAs an example, Holland pointed to the 2014 Sylvester Stallone action flick \"Expendables 3.\" Of the films in the Expendables trilogy, it earned the least money because it was leaked by hackers, he said. Hollywood executives pay attention to that hazard, he said, and make a decision on whether they should pay based on what they stand to lose.\n\nHackers have the same mentality, though. It's why they target shows with massive followings, like \"Game of Thrones,\" HBO's most watched series. They know how much these shows are worth to the companies, and how much studios will pay to keep them safe.\n\n\"What if it's 'The Last Jedi,' or 'Avengers: Infinity War,' that are going to be billion dollar properties?\" Holland said.\n\nIt's a very different story than when Steve Harvey's show \"Funderdome\" was leaked. Reportedly, no one paid the ransom, or even wanted to download it for free.\n\nEasy money\n\nHacking Hollywood has become lucrative, and also easy for hackers.\n\nWhen you watch the credits roll at the end of a movie or show, think about how massive these productions are. Each one of those names and titles, from the director to the concept artist to the sound engineer, is a vulnerability hackers can try to exploit.\n\nAs show business goes digital and online, companies look for more-convenient ways to transfer files and work globally, which only makes it easier for hackers. Netflix became a prime example of the problems with weak links when a hacker stole episodes of \"Orange is the New Black\" from a third-party sound engineering studio, instead of from the streaming giant itself.\n\nHolland said all media companies are looking at third-party groups as their biggest risk now. Major companies like Sony, Netflix and HBO might be able to afford top-notch security for themselves, but they can't also protect the third-party studios they work with. With a global network to watch out for, protecting everything becomes far too burdensome for most Hollywood companies.\n\nIt's a common pitfall, one Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity strategy at Illumio, has seen for the last three years. He saw it happen with the Sony hacks in 2014, when he was the White House director of cybersecurity policy and investigating North Korea's alleged involvement.\n\nBack then, he had hoped the cyberattack against Sony would be a wake-up call for the rest of Hollywood. But the vulnerabilities have only expanded since.\n\n\"The last decade has been a massive expansion,\" Gleicher said. \"It's faster, it's easier, you get more efficiency. The side effect is that we understand our environments much less, and we have less control over them.\"\n\nThe Smartest Stuff: Innovators are thinking up new ways to make you, and the things around you, smarter.\n\niHate: CNET looks at how intolerance is taking over the internet.\n\nTags Security Game of Thrones HBO Hacking Netflix", "timeCrawl": "13:35:00", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8797985", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "id": 302, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Consultants", "id": 342, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "id": 495, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Radio/Formats", "id": 596, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

We simply have not yet been able to do so\".\n\nThe executive continues: \"You have the advantage of having surprised us. In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week.\n\n\"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin.\"\n\nThe offer may have been an attempt to stall for time, rather than a genuine proposal of payment. HBO came clean about the hack four days after the bug bounty payment was offered, telling the public that it had experienced a \"cyber-incident, which resulted in the compromise of proprietary information\".\n\nA script for Game of Thrones, and two unreleased episodes of dramas Ballers and Room 104, were put online the same day. A week after the payment offer, on 3 August, the attackers sent out more evidence of hacked materials, and claimed to have access to the company's entire webmail system - a claim denied by HBO.\n\nThe hackers later released the personal details of some Game of Thrones actors, including email addresses and phone numbers, plus some HBO emails and confidential files, along with a renewed demand for a multimillion dollar ransom.\n\nBug bounty payments are a common occurrence in cybersecurity, designed to encourage third-parties to discover and report weaknesses found in security systems so they can be fixed, rather than sell the information to would-be attackers.\n\nBut it is uncommon for them to be paid following the active exploitation of a bug to steal substantial quantities of data, and extremely uncommon for them to be paid to attackers who deliver payment demands in the form of a video of scrolling text set to dramatic music, asking for a payment of \"six months salary\", or $6m - as the HBO attackers did.\n\nAt least one Hollywood hack victim has paid the ransom demanded by attackers, according to the Hollywood Reporter. But most victims refuse to talk about the ransom requests, fearing that admission they paid will make them a target for future attacks.\n\nStolen nude photos and hacked defibrillators: is this the future of ransomware?", "timeCrawl": "09:34:00", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 272, "date": "2017-07-27", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 279}, {"textStart": 700, "date": "2017-07-23", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 707}, {"textStart": 1638, "date": "2017-08-03", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1646}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8579838", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Merchant_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Merchant Services", "id": 343, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {"liCnt": 30}}

Later, material was posted to a (now defunct) website that included unaired episodes of Ballers and scripts for Game Of Thrones.\n\nThe image of the leaked email suggests that negotiations have been ongoing for some time, with the network attempting to delay the release of its content.\n\n\"In the spirit of professional cooperation, we are asking you to extend your deadline for one week,\" the email stated, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"As a show of good faith on our side, we are willing to commit to making a bug bounty payment of $250,000 to you as soon as we can establish the necessary account and acquire bitcoin,\" it added, referencing the type of reward typically provided to legitimate researchers.\n\n\"We also have not been able to put into place the necessary infrastructure to be able to make a large payment in bitcoin, although we are taking steps to do so,\" the exec allegedly added. At the time of writing, it remains unclear if any cryptocurrency was ever transferred.\n\nOne inside source told Variety that the email was \"worded that way to stall for time\" as the network scrambled to understand exactly what had been compromised. The email was sent under the name 'Mr Smith', the same pseudonym the hacker used in previous messages.\n\nOn Tuesday 8 August, it emerged that the hacker had sent a video message to HBO's chief executive, Richard Plepler, demanding millions of dollars in ransom. The culprit later released 3.4GB of files which reportedly included a month's worth of company emails.\n\nWithin the leaked files, one document was said to contain the phone numbers and home addresses of multiple members of the Game Of Thrones season 7 cast. In previous statements to the press, Plepler has played down the scope of the attack and the disclosure of emails.\n\nHe said: \"Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and disturbing for all of us.\n\n\"I can assure you that our senior leadership and our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are working round the clock to protect our collective interests.

illegally on Friday - days after a script from the newest instalment of the fantasy series was published on the Internet.\n\nAt that time, no one really knew what the motive was behind the cyber crime.\n\nThe demands came in the form of a five-minute video addressed to the network's CEO, Richard Plepler, from a \"Mr. Smith\", as reported by Business Insider's Alexandra Ma.\n\nIn the video sent to Pleper, obtained by Mashable, the hackers say that they want up to $7.5 million in bitcoin delivered later this week.\n\nNumerous more than 50 internal documents in the dump were labeled \"confidential\", including a spreadsheet of legal claims against the network, job offer letters to several top executives, slides discussing future technology plans and a list of 37,977 emails called \"Richard's Contact list\", an apparent reference to Plepler. The hackers claim to make about $12 to 15 million per year while spending an upwards of $500,000 on zero day exploits to carry out their attacks.\n\nThe video letter, written by a certain 'Mr. \"Find yourself another budget for your advertisements!\", they. The letter ends with an image of the \"Night King\" villain from GoT with his arms raised - the word \"standing\" in one hand and \"falling\" in the other.\n\nThe statement adds: \"We continue to work around the clock with outside cybersecurity firms and law enforcement to resolve the incident\". In 2014, Sony also fell victim to hacking.\n\nHackers have already leaked two episodes of the game before it was officially streamed. Yet recently, in light of a ransom video reported to be from the hackers themselves, the objective was revealed: they want HBO to pay a ransom, or they leak more data, with the looming threat of suffering more hackings in the future.\n\nDo you think HBO will give in to the hackers and pay the ransom?\n\nRelated News: 09 August 2017 New report sheds light on civilian deaths in Iraq & Syria 09 August 2017 North Korea top of agenda at ASEAN meeting 09 August 2017 Serena Williams reveals 'scariest thing' about becoming a mom 09 August 2017 Korea threatens missile strike near Guam, warns of all-out war 09 August 2017 Philippine President On Human Rights: \"Don't Go There\" 09 August 2017 Original Godzilla Actor Haruo Nakajima Dead At 88 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist killed in Pulwama encounter 09 August 2017 Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland Completes Meetings at ASEAN Forum - Ministry 09 August 2017 Groups sue Trump over transgender military policy 09 August 2017 Kailyn Lowry admits that 'Teen Mom 2' has ruined their lives 09 August 2017 North Korea Says Seriously Considering Plan to Strike Guam 09 August 2017 Starbucks now offering horchata frappuccino", "timeCrawl": "11:02:00", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-09", "textStart": 2281, "freq": 11, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2295}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-08", "id": "8597051", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "id": 41, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "id": 164, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "id": 268, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "id": 333, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "id": 531, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "id": 675, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Given that these TVCs are the ones that keep the show funded, there were just some that featured a ridiculous amount of advertisements that you can actually take a quick bath and not miss anything.\n\nIn this digital age, when you can simply watch your favorite shows online, and avoid or skip those commercials, TV fans are facing an even worse enemy -- spoilers.\n\nPosting spoilers in social media is one sure way to become popular and #InstaFamous -- just not among your friends. People have been unfollowed and blocked on social media for posting spoilers, real relationships strained and friendships ended just because you were too excited to tell everyone who died in the upcoming episode.\n\nIf you are a Game of Thrones (GoT) die hard, you know how hard it is to remain an unsullied fan, as the Internet is dark and full of spoilers.\n\nOh Spoiler Alert: Ned Stark dies.\n\nRecently, however, a group of hackers are threatening to release not just spoilers but entire scripts and other information about Game of Thrones unless they are paid an undisclosed amount by HBO. This is different from the Episode 4 leak released a few days ahead of its telecast by one of HBO's distribution partners. HBO is the latest in the list of Hollywood entertainment companies to suffer a major cyber attack. The hackers claim to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from the HBO company which includes draft scripts from five Game of Thrones episodes, and two unreleased episodes of Ballers and Room 104, detailed script summaries, castings, marketing materials, media plans and even the personal phone numbers and e-mail addresses of some Game of Thrones cast members.\n\nThe hackers then sent a \"video letter\" to the HBO bosses, saying: \"We successfully breached into your huge network.\" The message reportedly added: \"HBO was one of our difficult targets to deal with but we succeeded [it took about six months].\"\n\n\"Mr. Smith\" then made their intentions clear: \"Our demand is clear and nonnegotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your data.... HBO spends 12 million for Market Research and 5 million for GoT7 advertisements. So consider us another budget for your advertisements!\"\n\nReports estimate that the \"six-month salary in bitcoin\", which they implied, would amount to at least $6 million. For those of you who are not familiar with bitcoin, it is a digital cryptocurrency that is accepted by a number of international retailers. A single bitcoin is worth almost $3,500 and is used by many computer criminals because it's difficult to trace.\n\nThe video ended with the message: \"There are two mottos. Which one is remembered -- Winter is coming -- HBO is Falling OR Winter is Coming -- HBO is standing and everlasting!\" This was followed by an image of the Night King, a villain from Game of Thrones with his arms raised, the word \"standing\" in one hand and \"falling\" in the other.\n\nNow, I used to be a Game of Thrones fan during the first two or three seasons, but went cold turkey when it became too popular, just like what happened to my other favorite The Walking Dead.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think GoT is one of the best TV series of all time and each episode seems to be getting better. But when your entire feed is just full of opinions, analysis and, yes, spoilers from \"experts\", you eventually get tired of it all.\n\nIf the spoilers and leaks do get out, I wonder how it's going to affect the fans, especially those who\n\nreally wait for the scheduled airing date. More important, what should HBO do to prevent something like this from happening in the next season?\n\nTV GET-TOGETHERS\n\nI guess that's one of the nicer things about being born before everything was on the Internet. Growing up, our entire family would gather in front of the TV after dinner to watch our favorite shows, especially during Friday and weekend.\n\nBack then, you really had to make time because you only get one chance to watch an episode and since there was no cable, replays were very, very rare.\n\nWith the emergence and growing popularity of video-on-demand services, like Netflix, HOOQ, iWantTV, etc., not to mention the millions of videos available on YouTube, traditional TV has taken a backseat in other countries, but not here in the Philippines. For most Filipinos, watching TV continues to be their main source of entertainment.\n\nAccording to TV audience measurement provider Kantar Media, 96.6 percent of Filipinos tuned in to their televisions daily in 2016. The survey says we spend longer durations -- particularly 3.7 hours in average -- watching our favorite programs.\n\nFor some, watching television might be a simple habit. But for others, it's a chance to break free and relax from their hectic lifestyles or strengthen bonds with people they share the experience with. Watching TV can be a social event on its own and a chance to share some good times with family and friends.\n\nIt's one of the reason local brand Devant is pushing its 7:30 TV Get Together (G2G) habit. The campaign encourages more people to put down their gadgets and spend time with their friends and family by bonding over their favorite shows.\n\nWhile other TV manufacturers try to outdo each other with impressive technical specifications, smart technology and tons of other features, Devant also focuses on what makes TV viewing a fun experience.\n\nOn August 8 Devant teamed up with Marco Polo Ortigas and Craig Lines for an exclusive screening of the film The Owner. The event gathered a group of media who played a few games and had dinner together. But as soon as the clock struck 7:30 pm, everyone shifted their attention to the two giant Devant screens to watch the movie.\n\nI intentionally didn't watch the trailer or read about the movie, just so I wouldn't have any biases or expectations -- which turned out to be a good thing. It felt like the old days when you just watch everything unfold on the screen and allow yourself to get immersed in the storytelling without any background knowledge to spoil things for you.\n\nThe Owner is a film that follows the journey of a lost backpack around the world. The international feature film showcases the many mysteries of the bag's travels, while showing the intersecting lives of the fascinating characters it got in touch with throughout the story. What makes it even more unique is that the movie's story spans five continents and is a collaborative effort of 25 filmmakers. The movie is a perfect example of a work of art that gives TV watching a deeper meaning. It encourages people to think and consider, and it also gives everyone the chance to be open to things that could enrich their lives and mind-sets through their TV experience.\n\nDevant Marketing Manager Lara Lua said, \"The role of television in the lives of people are more punctuated than ever, and the brand aims to use technology to keep in step with the changes of how people consume content. It is our promise to deliver a richer entertainment experience through Devant's advanced TV technology.\"\n\n****", "timeCrawl": "01:45:00", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5432, "date": "2017-08-08", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5440}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8730542", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "id": 111, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "id": 197, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "id": 212, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "id": 552, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Jewelry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Jewelry", "id": 553, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "id": 758, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "id": 1010, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The best-of-seven series between the No. 4 seed and the No. 1 seed in the East begins on Tuesday at the TD Garden in Boston.\n\nThe teams squared off three times in the regular season. The Celtics won the first two matchups in Boston in December. Cleveland won the most recent game.\n\nHere are the scores from their three-game season series:\n\nCleveland Cavaliers vs. Boston Celtics: Stats and top performers\n\nDonovan Mitchell has shown the world that he can carry an NBA team, averaging 44.5 points in games 6 and 7 against the Orlando Magic. Ironically, the only win by the Cavs this season against the Celtics had Mitchell sidelined. When active, Mitchell is still the Cavs' go-to scorer, but he'll need more help from his teammates in this series with the Celtics.\n\nDarius Garland has been good for the Cavs, and he needs to weather the defense of Derrick White and Jrue Holiday.\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown have been the cornerstone of the Celtics, and the organization gave them help by getting Kristaps Porzingis and Jrue Holiday during the offseason.\n\nTheir numbers against the Cavs reflect their usual stats, and the Celtics will rely on their defense to try to suffocate their opponent's backcourt tandem.\n\nCleveland Cavaliers vs. Boston Celtics: Last 5 games\n\nCavaliers' last 5 games\n\nAfter winning the first two games against the Orlando Magic, the Cavs went 2-3. Games 5 and 7 were the ones they won, but this team needs to start out well against the Celtics.\n\nCeltics' last 5 games\n\nOn the other side, the Celtics capitalized on a Jimmy Butler-less Miami Heat in five games. Game 2 was their only loss, but they swept the next three games by an average margin of 22.6 points. The team will still have no Kristaps Porzingis against the Cavs and need Al Horford and Luke Kornet to step up.\n\nHow to watch Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Boston Celtics?\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Boston Celtics best-of-seven series starts on Tuesday, and TNT will be handling the television broadcast. The same feed can be seen through an online live stream on NBA League Pass and for those who are on the road, SiriusXM, 99.5 Sports Hub and WTAM/WNZN are the official radio partners.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ernest_leo_hernandez@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ernest Leo Hernandez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kornet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Kornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_League_Pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA League Pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTAM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "label": "dmoz/Games/Resources", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/49348-17149468522481-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The hosts of the CLNS Media \"Celtics Beat\" podcast, Adam Kaufman and Evan Valenti, sat down with NBC Sports Boston's Drew Carter on a recent episode to talk it over.\n\nThey talk about if the Celtics-Heat first-round playoff match-up, if Joe Mazzulla is a good coach, and whether or not it matters if the path to the Finals is easy. Check it out below.\n\nIf you enjoy this pod, check out the \"How Bout Them Celtics,\" \"First to the Floor,\" and the many other New England sports podcasts available on the CLNS Media network.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nFormer Celtics floor general Shane Larkin inks new 4-year deal with Anadolu Efes Toughness means something different to the Boston Celtics Grant Williams opens up on his rep, Mavs, trade to Charlotte Hornets and more Is it better that the Boston Celtics have five days off while they wait to see who their 2024 NBA East semis opponent is?

It took Joe Mazzulla's team five games to overcome a gritty and well-coached roster led by Erik Spoelstra. However, Boston held the Heat to under 100 points in four of their five matchups. And they consistently found ways to create space around the rim or to generate favorable matchups.\n\nIn the latest episode of the Celtics Chronicle podcast, host Adam Taylor broke down how the Celtics pivoted from their usual offensive approach to take advantage of Jayson Tatum's shooting gravity in game five. Mazzulla had his team attacking down the wings more frequently, rather than penetrating from the top of the three-point line.\n\nBoston's slight tweak allowed the Celtics to jump out to a sustainable lead over Miami, making the close-out game less competitive than one would usually expect from a Heat team that made the NBA Finals last season.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast by clicking on the embedded link above.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nCan the Celtics win without Kristaps Porzingis?

The Heat made things interesting early as they stole game two on the road, but the Celtics won the next three games to win the series in five. Now, they are headed to the next round to take on either the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Orlando Magic. One issue for Boston moving forward, however, is that Kristaps Porzingis is currently batting an injury.\n\nKristaps Porzingis is dealing with a calf strain right now and he is expected to miss several games as he needs to get healthy again. Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, two former Celtics, discussed the injury on their podcast, Ticket & The Truth, and Garnett thinks that Boston could be in trouble without Porzingis.\n\n\"Porzingis is a big part of why we view the Celtics as damn near unstoppable or we got them on this higher tier just because of what he brings,\" Garnett said on the podcast. \"I think that if he's not indefinitely out, I think that the Celtics are good enough to still keep going. ... The Celtics are not the same team without him.\"\n\nGetting past the Heat, the eight seed, is one thing, but the road is going to get a lot more difficult now that they are into the next round. No matter who they play next, the Cavaliers or the Magic, is going to put up a good fight. Both of those teams have a lot of talent and can hang with a shorthanded Celtics team. Once they get into the conference finals, if they can get past the second round, things will get even tougher.\n\n\"I think they can ... maybe ... get through round two,\" Paul Pierce said. \"But once you start getting to the Conference Finals, it's a different ball game. You need him.\"\n\nPotential path to the finals for Celtics without Kristaps Porzingis\n\nThe Celtics were far and away the best team in the NBA during the regular season record-wise, but with Porzingis out, they could be in the trouble. Boston has been known for their playoff shortcomings in recent years, and it's going to be much more difficult to put an end to that trend because of this injury. Something always seems to go wrong in the postseason for this team, and this injury to Porzingis could be the thing that plagues them this season.\n\nBoston will take on either the Cavaliers or the Magic in the second round, and the books are expecting it to be the Cavaliers and they are favored by 3.5 points. Game seven of that series will take place on Sunday at 1:00 ET.\n\nIf the Celtics get past that series, they would take on either the New York Knicks or the Indiana Pacers in the conference finals. A healthy Boston team shouldn't have much trouble getting to the finals going up against any of these remaining teams, but it's a different ballgame without Kristaps Porzingis. It's all going to come down to how long he is out and if he's really playing at 100% when he does return.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7365274571.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

These two teams haven't squared off in the postseason since the 2018 Eastern Conference Finals, yet this will be their ninth series against one another. The Celtics have only played four other franchises more frequently in their playoff history.\n\nSo, who'll triumph in this Eastern Conference Semifinals showdown? Here are three bold Celtics predictions ahead of the second-round clash.\n\nDerrick White will average over 20 points per game this series\n\nThe No. 1 seed Celtics will likely be the betting favorites over the fourth-seeded Cavaliers. However, that doesn't mean Boston can take Cleveland lightly.\n\nSince Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis could miss the entire series with a calf strain, Boston will need everyone else to be at their best (or at least close to it).\n\nIn the first round against Miami, stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were solid, but far from perfect. Celtics guard Derrick White turned out to be the real Heat killer, as he averaged 22.4 points per game on 57.7% shooting from the field.\n\nThe second-year Celtic had a strong case for making his first All-Star team this season, averaging 15.2 points and posting a career-high 1.2 blocks per outing on the defensive end. White didn't end up on the Eastern Conference team, yet he showed the league what they were missing when he dropped a career-high 38 points in a Game 4 win over the Heat.\n\nAnother record night like that from White probably won't happen against a tough Cleveland defense that's much healthier than Miami. Boston would gladly take another high-scoring series from him though, especially with Tatum and Brown drawing the most defensive attention.\n\nWhite was the second-leading scorer on the Celtics mainly because he buried open looks generated by swarming double teams surrounding his All-Star teammates. He was also great off the dribble, making him a potent third option who's willing to step up.\n\nRegardless, to defeat Cleveland, the C's can't only rely on hot-shooting from White. They'll need Tatum and Brown to take over when necessary while keeping their turnovers down against the seventh-ranked defense in the NBA.\n\nDonovan Mitchell will have at least one 40-point game\n\nMiami has 2024 All-Star Bam Adebayo, but it didn't have anyone who could get buckets like Cavaliers star Donovan Mitchell.\n\nThe five-time All-Star has plenty of impressive playoff performances under his belt, and he torched the Magic when it mattered in the first round. Over the course of Games 6 and 7, he scored a whopping 89 points, leading his team in scoring in both contests.\n\nHis 50-point bomb in Game 6 also demonstrated that, despite the loss, Mitchell is a clutch performer more often than not. He could very well go for 40 points against the Celtics; however, the key for Boston will be to contain his offensive explosion to just one game or so.\n\nPerhaps defensive specialist Jrue Holiday will be tasked with guarding Mitchell throughout the series. No matter who gets the majority of the assignment, the entire team will have to bring their A-game on defense to slow Cleveland's top guy down.\n\nCeltics will win the series, but won't sweep\n\nBoston has played better than the up-and-down Cavs for most of the season. Yet, Kristaps Porzingis' untimely injury could be a significant blow for the C's.\n\nTherefore, it's hard to see the Celtics sweeping the Cavs in this second-round series. Even an injured Heat team squeaked out a single victory over Boston, and that banged-up squad isn't better than Cleveland. It's also worth remembering that 11 of the last 12 meetings between the Celtics and Cavs were decided by single-digit margins.\n\nAlthough Porzingis might sit for every game, Cavs center Jarrett Allen isn't 100% either. The 6-foot-11 big man missed Cleveland's must-win Game 7 due to a rib injury. Before that, he didn't participate in Games 5 or 6 either.\n\nThe Cavs would like as much size as possible against the Celtics, who will likely start 6-foot-9 Al Horford in Porzingis' absence. Because of Cleveland's height, strong defense, and star power, it could take two to three games from the C's.\n\nStill, the Celtics should triumph in six to seven games. Boston's starting five remains formidable even without Porzingis, and Sam Hauser, Payton Pritchard and Luke Kornet have all provided some good minutes off the bench.\n\nAs the Heat have taught them, the Celtics know that no team can be underestimated in the playoffs. They'll have to keep that same mentality in the second round and prepare for what should be a much more difficult matchup.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The veteran big man is a core part of Joe Mazzulla's rotation and one of the most important pieces to the team's style of play. However, he could miss multiple weeks as he recovers from a right soleus strain he suffered against the Miami Heat.\n\nIn the latest episode of ESPN's NBA Today, insiders Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe joined host Malika Andrews to discuss how the Celtics should move forward with Porzingis once he is cleared to play. One of the options discussed was to play it slow, and slowly re-integrate him back into the rotation, ensuring not to re-aggrevate the injury and potentiall risk him beind sidelined for the rest of the playoffs.\n\nWhatever the Celtics decide to do, they will undoubtedly need to be careful with how they utilize Porzingis. He has proven himself to be incredibly versatile and important to the franchise's chances of success.\n\nYou can watch the full discussion by clicking on the embedded video above.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nPayton Pritchard opens up about his increased opportunity with the Boston Celtics this season How the Boston Celtics torched the Miami Heat's defense using Jayson Tatum Can the Celtics win without Kristaps Porzingis?", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malika_Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malika Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2024/04/2147990257-e1714252215674.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nIt's been no secret for just about the whole 2023-24 NBA season that the Boston Celtics are the team to beat.\n\nThey've had the lowest odds all season and things have only gotten easier for them with the Bucks and 76ers falling in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nWhat are their odds to reach the NBA Finals now? What're their odds to win banner No. 18? Let's take a look ahead of their Eastern Conference Semifinals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nREAD: Best NBA Playoffs Betting Apps & SitesREAD: Updated 2024 NBA Finals odds 2024 Boston Celtics odds for Eastern Conference Playoffs, NBA Finals: Celtics nearly out of plus-money territory to win NBA Title Boston Celtics odds to win 2024 NBA Finals: (+115 or better)\n\nThe Celtics are as low as +100 on some books and should see it dip into minus-money range once they inevitably get past the Cleveland Cavaliers and see who they'll face in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhether it's the Knicks or Pacers, the Celtics should have no problem getting past them and advancing to their second NBA Finals in three years.\n\nBoston's biggest challenge of the playoffs should be who it'll face in the NBA Finals. The early favorites to meet the Celtics were the reigning champion Denver Nuggets, but a Game 1 loss to the Timberwolves in the Western Semifinals has oddsmakers flipping to take Minnesota to advance to the WCFs.\n\nIf that's the case, Boston's odds should skyrocket to even heavier favorites than they have been to get their 18th championship.\n\nThe T-Wolves, Thunder or Mavericks would all be formidable opponents for the Celtics, but their inexperience this deep into the playoffs -- plus other weaknesses -- would be too much for Boston to exploit.\n\n2024 Eastern Conference Champion odds: Boston Celtics (-270 or better)\n\nA healthy Bucks or 76ers team would have been the biggest threats to the Celtics sprint toward the Eastern Conference crown.\n\nHowever, Giannis Antetokounmpo missed all of the first round, Damian Lillard got hurt then either missed time or played injured for Milwaukee; and Philly's Joel Embiid played with a compromised knee for the whole series against the Knicks.\n\nInstead, it's up to the Cleveland, Indiana or New York to keep the Celtics from what's been expected of them all season.\n\nTo put it lightly, the Pacers won't have the defense to keep the Celtics down, the Knicks won't have the offense and the Cavaliers won't have either -- specifically if Jarrett Allen remains out and can't man the middle for them.\n\nOverall, the Knicks probably would've had the best chance if Julius Randle was available and Bojan Bogdanovic didn't get hurt against Philly.\n\nIt's all but set for the Celtics to raise the Bob Cousy Trophy.\n\nCeltics vs. Cavaliers best bet: Celtics -2.5 series spread (-170 or better)\n\nIt took a franchise playoff-record 23 3-pointers for the Heat to take down the Celtics in Boston during Game 2 of Round 1. You can also tack on Miami just having Boston's number in recent playoff history to this one considering they did it all without Jimmy Butler.\n\nBut it was otherwise an open-and-shut series for the Celtics, who finished the Heat off in five games.\n\nThe Cavaliers are coming off an exhausting seven-game series with Orlando that came down to home-court advantage, with the home team winning every game.\n\nThe C's went 37-4 at home this season, while the Cavs were 22-19 on the road. The Celtics beat the Cavaliers by an average of 8 points in their two matchups in Boston. It took six 3-pointer by Dean Wade off the bench to give Cleveland a 105-104 win over Boston at home.\n\nRespectfully, Boston should be up 2-0 once the series shifts to Cleveland, but we'll give the Cavaliers a chance at winning one of the two home games and the series finishing in Boston for Game 5, at the latest.\n\n2024 NBA playoff props: Underdog DFS promo code BETFPB for basketball prop betting\n\nSome legal betting states do allow NBA prop betting, but it's much more widespread at a DFS site such as Underdog, which offers $100 guaranteed bonus when registering with our Underdog NBA promo code BETFPB when signing up.\n\nUnderdog DFS allows you to choose Higher or Lower on NBA props, similar to an over/under.

Although, they may start the second round without Jarrett Allen, their former All-Star center who's dealing with a rib fracture that sidelined him for the final three matchups against

With how good they've been all season, anything less would be a huge disappointment.\n\nThe next test for the Celtics should be tougher than the first. Boston won the season series 2-1, though all three games were within five points in the last five minutes and were all won by the home team.\n\nThe Celtics will have the extra home game once again, though they likely won't have Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nSeries schedule\n\nHere's how to watch the Celtics vs. Cavaliers series:\n\nCan Donovan Mitchell get some help? Mitchell is a terrific postseason performer who has now scored at least 30 points in 23 of his 51 career playoff games, with that total of 23 being one shy of Jayson Tatum (24/99) for ninth among active players.\n\nBut, even though Mitchell averaged 28.7 points, the Cavs scored just a point per possession over their seven games against the Orlando Magic. (Only New Orleans was less efficient in the first round.)\n\nThe Cavs will now face a defense that ranked one spot higher than that of the Magic. The Celtics have multiple great defenders they can assign to Mitchell, and they can put multiple defenders in front of him on every possession. The spotlight will be on Darius Garland, who suffered a drop-off in production this season and averaged just 14.9 points in the first round.\n\nKeep your eyes on\n\nBig man attrition. Porzingis' absence leaves the Celtics with a starting lineup that was good but not great (plus-2.7 points per 100 possessions) in the regular season, though it was better (in a small sample size) in the first round. And with Al Horford in the starting lineup, the Celtics' bench is a little thinner.\n\nPorzingis might not be the only center missing at the start of this series, as the Cavs' Jarrett Allen missed the final three games of the first round with a rib contusion. Cleveland has also been without Dean Wade, who gave them good minutes at the four in the regular season.\n\nFor Boston: Shots near the basket. The Celtics took more jumpers than any other team during regular season, with a league-high 57% of their shots from outside the paint. That rate was a tick higher (58%) in the first round, and they're now without their leading post-up threat.\n\nWe know the Celtics can beat any team from the perimeter. They outscored their opponents by a league-high 10.7 points per game from 3-point range in the regular season and were a plus-11.4 from beyond the arc against Miami despite the Heat's 23 3s in Game 2. But they can't settle and need to turn defensive stops into transition opportunities to put less pressure on their 3-point shooting.\n\nFor Cleveland: Bench minutes. The Celtics had the top-ranked bench in the regular season, and it's been better in the playoffs. The Cavs' bench ranked 15th in the regular season and 11th in the first round, when they were outscored by 14 points per 100 possessions with Georges Niang on the floor.\n\nNiang saw his minutes cut over the last three games, and Sam Merrill hit a couple of big shots in Cleveland's comeback from 18 points down on Sunday. Returns from Allen and/or Wade would certainly help with the depth issues.\n\n1 key number to know\n\n100.7 - The Celtics allowed the Heat to score just 100.7 points per 100 possessions in the first round. Two teams (including the Cavs) scored fewer, but that was the Celtics' best five-game stretch of defense and the Heat's second worst five-game stretch off offense this season. Miami was without Jimmy Butler and couldn't make up for his absence in the margins, ranking last in both free throw rate and offensive rebounding percentage in the first round.\n\nThe Cavs had the league's No. 1 defense last season and ranked second on that end of the floor before the All-Star break this year. But they're not the only great defensive team in this series.\n\nThe pick\n\nCeltics in 5. They're missing their starting center and facing a healthier team than their first-round opponent. But the Celtics remain the best team in the league and, with their Game 5 victory over Miami, they're 22-4 without Porzingis. That includes a 10-3 mark against playoff teams, with the Celtics having outscored their opponents by 8.6 points per 100 possessions over those 13 games.\n\nThe Cavs are a very good team with a star who can give them a chance on any night. They've played well against Boston this season, but they haven't shown that they can score efficiently enough to keep up with the Celtics over the next two weeks.\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Warner Bros.

What're their odds to win banner No. 18? Let's take a look ahead of their Eastern Conference Semifinals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nREAD: Best NBA Playoffs Betting Apps & SitesREAD: Updated 2024 NBA Finals odds2024 Boston Celtics odds for Eastern Conference Playoffs, NBA Finals: Celtics nearly out of plus-money territory to win NBA TitleBoston Celtics odds to win 2024 NBA Finals: (+115 or better)\n\nThe Celtics are as low as +100 on some books and should see it dip into minus-money range once they inevitably get past the Cleveland Cavaliers and see who they'll face in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhether it's the Knicks or Pacers, the Celtics should have no problem getting past them and advancing to their second NBA Finals in three years.\n\nBoston's biggest challenge of the playoffs should be who it'll face in the NBA Finals. The early favorites to meet the Celtics were the reigning champion Denver Nuggets, but a Game 1 loss to the Timberwolves in the Western Semifinals has oddsmakers flipping to take Minnesota to advance to the WCFs.\n\nIf that's the case, Boston's odds should skyrocket to even heavier favorites than they have been to get their 18th championship.\n\nThe T-Wolves, Thunder or Mavericks would all be formidable opponents for the Celtics, but their inexperience this deep into the playoffs -- plus other weaknesses -- would be too much for Boston to exploit.\n\n2024 Eastern Conference Champion odds: Boston Celtics (-270 or better)\n\nA healthy Bucks or 76ers team would have been the biggest threats to the Celtics sprint toward the Eastern Conference crown.\n\nHowever, Giannis Antetokounmpo missed all of the first round, Damian Lillard got hurt then either missed time or played injured for Milwaukee; and Philly's Joel Embiid played with a compromised knee for the whole series against the Knicks.\n\nInstead, it's up to the Cleveland, Indiana or New York to keep the Celtics from what's been expected of them all season.\n\nTo put it lightly, the Pacers won't have the defense to keep the Celtics down, the Knicks won't have the offense and the Cavaliers won't have either -- specifically if Jarrett Allen remains out and can't man the middle for them.\n\nOverall, the Knicks probably would've had the best chance if Julius Randle was available and Bojan Bogdanovic didn't get hurt against Philly.\n\nIt's all but set for the Celtics to raise the Bob Cousy Trophy.\n\nCeltics vs. Cavaliers best bet: Celtics -2.5 series spread (-170 or better)\n\nIt took a franchise playoff-record 23 3-pointers for the Heat to take down the Celtics in Boston during Game 2 of Round 1. You can also tack on Miami just having Boston's number in recent playoff history to this one considering they did it all without Jimmy Butler.\n\nBut it was otherwise an open-and-shut series for the Celtics, who finished the Heat off in five games.\n\nThe Cavaliers are coming off an exhausting seven-game series with Orlando that came down to home-court advantage, with the home team winning every game.\n\nThe C's went 37-4 at home this season, while the Cavs were 22-19 on the road. The Celtics beat the Cavaliers by an average of 8 points in their two matchups in Boston. It took six 3-pointer by Dean Wade off the bench to give Cleveland a 105-104 win over Boston at home.\n\nRespectfully, Boston should be up 2-0 once the series shifts to Cleveland, but we'll give the Cavaliers a chance at winning one of the two home games and the series finishing in Boston for Game 5, at the latest.\n\n2024 NBA playoff props: Underdog DFS promo code BETFPB for basketball prop betting\n\nSome legal betting states do allow NBA prop betting, but it's much more widespread at a DFS site such as Underdog, which offers $100 guaranteed bonus when registering with our Underdog NBA promo code BETFPB when signing up.\n\nUnderdog DFS allows you to choose Higher or Lower on NBA props, similar to an over/under.

J.B. Bickerstaff's team overcame the Orlando Magic in a game seven matchup on Sunday (May 5), booking themselves a date with the Celtics. However, with Jarrett Allen potentially dealing with an injury and Donovan Mitchell looking beat up, Cleveland may find themselves in an uphill battle.\n\nThe Celtics are arguably the best team in basketball. They boast six players that could argue for an All-Star selection in any given season. And they have a top-five candidate in Jayson Tatum. There's a reason Boston is viewed as a potential championship contender.\n\nIn the latest episode of 'The Celtics Chronicle' podcast, the hosts discuss the impending matchup and what we can expect to see from both teams. They hit on the matchups, defense, and how to protect the rim without Kristaps Porzingis in the rotation, as he continues to recover from injury.\n\nYou can watch the full podcast by clicking on the embedded link above.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf\n\nBoston's Kristaps Porzingis expects to heal at a 'historic rate' Celtics Lab 256: Cleveland Cavaliers emerge to face Boston in the East semis - what you need to know Grant Williams reveals what it was like changing coaches from Ime Udoka to Joe Mazzulla", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grant Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ime_Udoka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ime Udoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://celticswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2024/03/USATSI_22106357-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 200}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Silas would play for the Hawks in St. Louis and after they moved to Atlanta, Georgia as well as the Phoenix Suns before being dealt to Boston in the spring of 1972.\n\nThere, he would win two banners, be elected to multiple All-Defensive teams, and an All-Star Game -- among many other honors.\n\nBoston instead took center Joe Strawder with the 34th overall pick out of Bradley, but the big man never suited up for the Celtics.\n\nHe was instead sent to the Detroit Pistons for cash considerations, where he played three seasons.\n\nThe Celtics also drafted small forward Ron Bonham out of Cincinnati with the 16th overall pick.\n\nBonham would win two rings with Boston, in 1965 and 1966 -- his sole two seasons with the team. He averaged 6.3 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 0.4 assists per game over that stretch.\n\nWinslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoston selected big man Mel Counts with the seventh overall pick out of Oregon State, and Counts would also win two championships with the Celtics, again in 1965 and 1966.\n\nHe played just those two seasons with Boston, recording 6.8 points, 5.8 boards, and 0.6 assists per contest.\n\nFinally, the Celtics drafted center John Thompson, who also played just two seasons with Boston, both banner years, again in 1965 and 1966.\n\nThompson would go on to have a Hall of Fame coaching career immediately after retiring as a player in 1966, averaging 3.5 points, as many boards, and 0.3 assists per game as a Celtic.\n\nIt was on this date in 1999 that the team cut Garnett from the roster -- though not the one you are likely thinking of. Guard Marlon Garnett -- no relation to KG -- was waived by the team after a 24-game stint in the 1998-99 NBA season.\n\nThe Santa Clara alum averaged 2.1 points per game over that stretch.\n\nThat same day, Boston signed guard Damon Jones to a rest-of-season deal after the Galveston native played well through a pair of 10-day deals.\n\nThe former Houston floor general played just 13 games total for the team, logging 5.8 points, 2.4 boards, and 2.2 assists per game as a Celtic.\n\nSadly, it is also the day in 1993 that we lost small forward Frank Kudelka.\n\nAn alum of Saint Mary's College of California, Kudelka was signed by the (now defunct) Chicago Stags in 1950 and was picked up by the (also defunct) Washington Capitals in the Stags dispersal draft when that team folded in 1950, only to be picked up by the Celtics a year later when the Capitals went belly up.\n\nKudelka played just 27 games with Boston before the team sold his contract to the (ALSO defunct) Baltimore Bullets in 1951, recording 4.7 points, 1.8 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game while with Boston.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nWhich is the better matchup for the Boston Celtics in the second round, the Cleveland Cavaliers, or the Orlando Magic?

It's the Celtics' fourth playoff series against Cleveland in the past 10 years, with the Cavs winning the previous three in 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nA lot has changed since then, of course: LeBron James took his talents from Cleveland to Los Angeles, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- thrust into starting roles during that 2018 series at age 19 and 21, respectively -- have blossomed into All-Stars for Boston.\n\nThe Celtics are the clear favorite this year after a dominant 64-18 regular season, but Kristaps Porzingis' calf injury -- which is expected to sideline him for the entire second round -- could complicate their path, while Donovan Mitchell will be eager to play spoiler against what might be his favorite NBA opponent (more on that later).\n\nSo, how will this one play out? Here's a full series preview featuring a recap of the teams' regular-season matchups, keys to victory for each squad and our series prediction.\n\nThe Celtics trailed by as many as 15 points early in the teams' first meeting but outscored Cleveland in each of the final three quarters to grind out a home win. Tatum and Brown scored 25 apiece while all five Boston starters reached double digits in a balanced scoring effort.\n\nTwo nights later, the Celtics again fended off a pesky Cavs team led by Donovan Mitchell (31 points, eight rebounds, six assists), Caris LeVert (26 points) and Darius Garland (19 points). In a near-carbon copy of their previous meeting, all five C's starters scored in double figures with Tatum (27 points) and Brown (22 points) leading the way.\n\nThe Celtics led by 22 points entering the fourth quarter and appeared on their way to a season series sweep. Then Dean Wade happened.\n\nThe Cavs role player exploded for 20 points in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 of 5 3-pointers and 7 of 7 shot attempts to help Cleveland storm back for a stunning victory despite playing without Mitchell. Tatum had a chance to win the game on the final possession but missed a last-second jumper as time expired.\n\nAll three of Boston's matchups with the Cavs were decided by fewer than 10 points, suggesting this could be a much more tightly-contested series than Round 1, where the Celtics led by as many as 27 points in all four of their victories over Miami.\n\nHere's how the Celtics and Cavs compared in several notable statistical categories during the regular season, with Boston holding the edge in all but one category. (NBA rank in parentheses.)\n\nThey keep two factors consistent: effort and pace.\n\nThe Celtics showed a puzzling lack of the former in their Game 2 loss to the Heat, but responded ratcheting up the defensive intensity in Games 3, 4 and 5. While the Cavs are much more talented offensively than Miami, the C's are almost impossible to beat when they're winning 50/50 balls and are connected defensively.\n\nOn offense, Boston provided a blueprint for success without Porzingis in Game 5 by cranking up the pace and keeping the ball moving, hitting 16 of 40 3-pointers while racking up 23 assists with eight players recording multiple helpers.\n\nThe Celtics were 43-10 this season when they attempted at least 40 3-pointers and 54-11 when they handed out at least 23 assists. When the ball stopped moving and the pace slowed, that's when Boston's offense ran into trouble.\n\nThe one silver lining of Porzingis' absence is that it should force the Celtics to increase their ball movement and push the pace instead of letting Porzingis go 1-on-1 in the post. If they can replicate what we saw in Game 5 against a less physical Cavs team, a spot in the Eastern Conference Finals awaits.\n\nTheir Big Two becomes the Big Three (or Four).\n\nMitchell is a postseason stud who's scored 30 or more points in 22 of his 50 career playoff games, including a 50-piece in Game 6 against the Magic and XX points in the Game 7 clincher. He's also a Celtics killer: His 29.6 points per game against Boston are the most he's scored against any NBA opponent (minimum five games played).\n\nThe Celtics' game plan should start with containing Mitchell and Garland, Cleveland's second-leading scorer and leading assister. But the Cavs have two role players capable of burning the C's: Caris LeVert and Max Strus.\n\nLeVert dropped 26 points on Boston back in December and has scored 40 or more points against the Celtics twice in his career. Strus, meanwhile, drilled eight 3-pointers in a three-game span against Boston as a member of the Heat to help Miami win the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nMitchell is fully capable of winning at least one game on his own, and if he gets help from his supporting cast, that number could increase.\n\nAnother storyline to monitor: Big man Jarrett Allen, who averaged 17 points and 13.8 rebounds in Games 1 through 4 against Orlando, has missed the last three games due to a rib injury. He and fell big man Evan Mobley are both excellent defenders as well who could make it difficult for Boston to score in the paint.\n\nThe Celtics enter the series as heavy favorites. We'll update with exact odds when they become available.\n\nCeltics in six.\n\nThe Cavs aren't the Heat, folks. Mitchell has a proven playoff track record and forms a strong backcourt alongside Garland. Big men Mobley and Allen (if healthy) could give Boston trouble on both ends with Porzingis likely sidelined for the entire series.\n\nThe Celtics are title favorites for a reason, though. They're immensely talented on both ends -- Derrick White's emergence as Boston's third-leading scorer is a game-changer offensively -- and showed impressive focus and maturity in their three consecutive wins over a scrappy Heat team in Round 1.\n\nMitchell may put the Cavs on his back in one game, and the C's may go cold beyond the arc in another. But the Celtics are too good for this series to last longer than six games.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They steamrolled the playoff-savvy Miami Heat in five games in the conference quarterfinals while the Cavs had to play seven games to finally eliminate the Orlando Magic.\n\nThe Celtics are rested. The Cavs are not. The Cavaliers were down by 18 points to the Magic in the second quarter on May 5, but they rallied to win, 106-94, and advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals and a date with the Celtics on May 7 at TD Garden in the series opener.\n\nThe Cavs, weary from their marathon with the Magic, didn't even get a chance to practice for the first game in the best-of-seven series with the Celtics. They reported to team headquarters at Cleveland Clinic Courts for treatment and film study on May 6 and then boarded a charter flight to Boston.\n\n\"We don't really have time to celebrate,\" Donovan Mitchell said after scoring 39 points in Game 7. \"This was phenomenal as a great win, great series, great test for us mentally and physically, but we can and we will have to be better to beat Boston.\"\n\nBetMGM is listing the Celtics at minus-1400 to knock out the Cavaliers, meaning a bettor would have to wager $1,400 just to win $100 (and recoup his or hers $1,400). BetMGM lists the Cavs at plus-800, meaning a $100 bet would return a profit of $800.\n\nDraftKings has slightly different numbers, listing the Celtics at minus-1200 and the Cavs the same -- plus 800. The DraftKings numbers project a series win probability for the Celtics of 92.31 percent, which means a 7.69 percent win probability for the Cavs.\n\nIn short, this should be the equivalent of the Cavaliers trying to climb Mount Everest in flip-flops. But here is the secret to Coach J.B. Bickerstaff's approach to this series and really any important game: He does not want his players to think about the big picture. He doesn't want them to think about the daunting task of beating the Celtics four times over the next 13 days. And since the Celtics have home-court advantage, to pull a huge upset the Cavaliers will have to win at least once in Boston, where the Celtics a bully-like 37-4 in the regular season.\n\n\"You can't be successful in this business if you can't handle pressure,\" Bickerstaff said. \"But we feel like pressure comes from lack of preparation. If you're prepared to do the job in front of you, there is no pressure because all you have to focus on is your training.\n\n\"You're thinking about the moments in front of you and not the outcome. That's where the pressure comes from. It comes from the people who are so concerned about the outcome, they forget about the moments in front of them that they have to go out and execute.\"\n\nBickerstaff made his remarks before Game 7 with the Magic, but they easily apply to the upcoming series with the Celtics and whomever they would meet next if they do pull the upset.\n\nThe Cavaliers fifth-year head coach drew on his experience for another observation that applies to the challenge his team is facing. Yes, the Celtics finished 16 games ahead of the Cavs in the regular season, but they are 0-0 as the playoffs begin.\n\n\"Nothing tomorrow matters,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Nothing that happened in the past matters. The only thing that matters is these 48 minutes we're getting ready to compete in and try to get it done.\"\n\nThe Celtics beat the Cavs two of the three times they played in the 2023-24 regular season, but the Cavaliers did win the last time the two teams met when they overcame a 22-point deficit to win, 105-104, on March 5 at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.\n\nAnd here's the kicker about that stunner two months ago: It was Travis Kelce-Jason Kelce bobblehead night at the FieldHouse. Mitchell missed the game with a knee injury. Evan Mobley exited with an ankle injury in the third quarter after scoring four points and grabbing six rebounds in 23 minutes. The ankle injury sidelined Mobley nine more games.\n\nDean Wade, an unlikely hero if there ever was one, scored 20 points in the fourth quarter to lead the comeback over the Celtics and end Boston's 11-game winning streak. So you never know.\n\nA knee injury has sidelined Wade since March 13. His status for the series with the Celtics is uncertain, but he did travel with the team to Boston. Game 2 in the series, also at TD Garden, is set for 7 p.m. May 9.\n\nThe Cavaliers advanced out of the first round as the fourth seed beating the fifth-seeded Magic. The Celtics knocked out the ninth seed Heat. The only upset so far in the East was the sixth-seed Pacers eliminated third-seed Milwaukee. Eight teams total from the East and West combined remain in the playoffs.\n\nThe pregame locker room meeting prior to tipoff May 7 would be a good time for Bickerstaff to remind the team of his \"Think about the moments in front of you and not the outcome\" mantra because the NBA on May 6 revealed its power rankings. Suffice it to say they are not favorable toward the Cavs.\n\nThe Celtics are ranked first followed by the Timberwolves, Thunder, Nuggets, Mavericks, Knicks, Pacers and Cavaliers. The Pacers are ranked ahead of the Cavs, even though at 47-35 they finished a game behind Cleveland in the regular season. It's as though the NBA has concluded the Cavs were lucky to outlast the Magic.\n\n\"The Cavs were outscored by 31 points over the seven games (with Orlando), the second-worst differential for a winning team in any series in the last 30 years,\" the rankings story pointed out. \"That mark is topped only by the Cavs' minus-40 differential in the 2018 first-round vs. Indiana.\"\n\nThat's just one more item for Bickerstaff to point to when he says nothing in the past matters. However, maybe now would be the right time to make an exception to that philosophy. The 2018 Cavs made it all the way to the NBA Finals before being swept by the Warriors in four games.", "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_schudel@news-herald.com", "name": "Jeff Schudel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Resorts_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MGM Resorts International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Bickerstaff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tatum didn't necessarily have to put up Herculean numbers in that series but received ample help from his Celtics superteam supporting cast, including separate outbursts from Derrick White, Jaylen Brown, and Kristaps Porzingis, before the big man went down with an injury.\n\nThis Celtics team has been the class of the NBA all year after the offseason additions of both Porzingis and Jrue Holiday, who struggled a bit offensively against the HEat but had an elite series defensively. One key contributor from seasons past who did not return to the Celtics for 2023-24 was Grant Williams, who was a solid contributor off of the Boston bench for a few years but whose brazen attitude apparently at times rubbed people the wrong way.\n\nRecently, Williams stopped by the Cedric Maxwell Podcast with, you guessed it, Celtics legend Cedric Maxwell, to react to some of the perceived disrespect that the Celtics have thrown his way since he left the franchise, including the lack of a tribute video that he received upon his return.\n\n\"I was a little bit disappointed just because I feel like there were some great years in those four years that I was there, I was a kid that got drafted there and I was a kid that grew up there,\" said Williams, per Celtics on CLNS on X, the social media platform formerly referred to as Twitter.\n\nAn interesting tenure\n\nGrant Williams reached the highest of highs and the lowest of lows during his bizarre tenure with the Celtics. One need look no further than Game 7 of the 2022 conference semifinals vs the Milwaukee Bucks, in which Williams poured in a shocking 27 points to propel the Celtics into the next round, to see what an immense impact he made at times.\n\nThen, there were some less proud moments, such as the two free throws he missed in a game vs the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2023 after telling Cavs guard Donovan Mitchell that he was going to make both just seconds before. There was also the scuffle he got into with Jimmy Butler in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, which then prompted Butler to go on a personal mini-run and put the Heat ahead 2-0 in that series, seemingly as a direct result of Williams' trash talk.\n\nIn any case, some have speculated that teams with a history as storied as the Celtics only reserve tribute videos for true franchise icons, even if they weren't necessarily star players, such as the immense love that Marcus Smart received in his Boston return earlier this year.\n\nAs for Williams, the former Tennessee Volunteer first took his talents to the Dallas Mavericks in free agency before the team traded him to the Charlotte Hornets, where he is currently still a member.\n\nDon't expect tensions between Williams and the Celtics to smooth over anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grant Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Bulldogs_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Butler Bulldogs men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic_and_Regional/European", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Ethnic and Regional/European", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Highland_Games", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Highland Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Grant-Williams-gets-brutally-honest-on-disrespect-from-Boston.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He had previously coached at the NBA level as a moderately successful head coach of the New York Knicks between 1987 and 1989, and most recently at Kentucky in the NCAA ranks.\n\nHis tenure with the Celtics went considerably worse, with the pressure to return to greatness after the longest losing streak in team history undoubtedly a factor in the several questionable 'win-now' decisions made by Pitino. The New Yorker would throw in the towel after four seasons with the franchise, amassing a 102-146 record in the regular season, good for a .411 winning percentage.\n\nHe never made the postseason in his role as team president and head coach.\n\nIt is also the date of Dennis Johnson's last game with the Celtics, in 1990. The game was against the New York Knicks, a Game 5 loss in the Eastern Conference Finals that had Boston finishing with a 121-114 loss.\n\nJohnson scored 21 points, 5 rebounds, and 10 assists in the final game of his career, as the Californian retired after the loss. The Pepperdine product played the last seven seasons of his career with the Celtics, averaging 12.6 points, 3.2 boards, and 6.4 assists with the team.\n\nToday is former Boston shooting guard Oliver Lafayette's birthday, who had the briefest of Celtics tenures.\n\nHe appeared in exactly one game after signing a rest-of-season contract with the team in April 2010, scoring 7 points.\n\nThe 1968 NBA Expansion draft was held today, in which Boston lost several players of note to help populate the rosters of the newly-formed Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns.\n\nAll three players taken from the Celtics were drafted by the Bucks, starting with wing Tom Thacker.\n\nJan 10, 2024;\n\nWinslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA former NCAA and NBA champion with Cincinnati and Boston respectively, Thacker chose to play in the ABA instead of reporting to Milwaukee, winning an ABA championship with the Indiana Pacers.\n\nThacker averaged 4.2 points, 2.5 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game in his sole season with the Celtics.\n\nThe second player taken was forward Johnny Jones, who played just one season with Boston, winning a ring on the 1967-68 squad.\n\nLike Thacker, Jones chose the ABA instead of reporting to the Bucks, signing with the Kentucky Colonels instead. He averaged 4.2 points, 2.2 boards, and 0.5 assists with the Celtics in that single season.\n\nFinally, the Celtics also lost big man Wayne Embry, a former five-time All-Star who also had won a ring with Boston in the 1967-68 NBA season.\n\nEmbry was the sole player of the three to report to Milwaukee, for whom he would play one season more before retiring permanently. He averaged 5.8 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 0.6 assists per game with the Celtics.\n\nOn this day in 1965, the NBA draft was held in New York City, and Boston selected two players of note.\n\nThe first was forward Ron Watts, drafted out of Wake Forest with the 17th overall pick of the draft.\n\nWatts would play just two seasons for the Celtics, technically winning a banner with the team in his rookie season despite only playing one game for Boston that year.\n\nWatts averaged 1.4 points, as many rebounds, and 0.1 assists per game in the 28 games he played for the Celtics between 1965 and 1967.\n\nThe other player taken by Boston was former UConn Huskies big man Toby Kimball, who played just one season with the club in 1966-67.\n\nJust under a year later, he would be taken from the franchise in the 1967 expansion draft by the (then) San Diego (now, Houston) Rockets, where he had the most success of his career.\n\nHe would record 2.6 points, 3.8 boards and 0.3 assists per contest with the Celtics.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nBoston's Kristaps

The Latvian center's absence, due to a right calf strain suffered in Game 4 of their first-round series against Miami, could shift the dynamics of the series.\n\nWhile his rehab is already underway, there is still no timetable for his return. Will his absence be enough to level the playing field in this series?\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nThe first step to analyzing this series is to examine how the Porzingis injury will impact the Celtics. Boston played 25 games without him during the regular season and went 21-4.\n\nAlthough the sample size is small, they had a higher winning percentage (.840) in games without him than when he was on the court (43-14, .754).\n\nFurthermore, the Celtics still posted a higher net rating (+12.6 vs. +11.3) in the games he missed than when he was available.\n\nThus, the numbers suggest the Celtics should have enough depth to overcome the Porzingis injury.\n\nThese teams played three games during the regular season, and Boston went 2-1 with a +5.3 net rating.\n\nHowever, both Celtics victories might have been aided by a scheduling quirk, as the teams played two games in Boston over three days. And both meetings occurred in December when Cleveland wasn't playing its best basketball.\n\nThe Cavaliers were amidst a 1-3 road trip that dropped their record to 13-12. Cleveland then went on a 22-4 run over its next 26 games.\n\nIn the third meeting, the Cavaliers held serve at home, winning 105-104 to snap Boston's 11-game winning streak. Cleveland won the game without its best player, Donovan Mitchell, who was out with a knee injury.\n\nThe Cavaliers also lost forward Evan Mobley in the third quarter of the game to an ankle injury. Mobley was also inactive (knee) for the two December losses against the Celtics.\n\nInterestingly, the Celtics were essentially at full strength for each of their meetings this season as their three best players -- Porzingis, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- were all involved in the action.\n\nThe Porzingis injury will undoubtedly impact Boston's floor spacing, particularly on the perimeter. Porzingis took 39% (5.1) of his shot attempts (13.2) from beyond the arc while posting a 37.5% three-point percentage.\n\nWith Al Horford (8.6 PPG) likely to replace Porzingis (20.1 PPG) in the starting lineup, look for Tatum and Brown to play a more prominent role offensively.\n\nWe know the Celtics will likely follow their preferred playing style of being aggressive offensively on the perimeter. Cleveland must be able to match that aggression with their perimeter defense or match Boston shot for shot.\n\nThe Cavaliers will likely opt for the latter, considering they outshot Boston in the three games from beyond the arc (50-of-120, 41.7% vs. 47-of-118, 39.8%).\n\nCleveland has a path to be competitive in this series, especially with Porzingis sidelined. However, according to ESPN Bet, teams that are -1400 or higher to win a series are on an 18-0 run dating back to 1990.\n\nBased on those overwhelming numbers, it's tough to look anywhere else but the Celtics in this matchup. Their homecourt advantage should be enough to help them emerge victorious and advance to the next round.\n\nNonetheless, it shouldn't be a cakewalk, as the Cavaliers are good enough to win some games in this series.\n\nCleveland's series price of +3.5 games is too good to pass up, even with the juice up to -225.\n\nBettors can also find additional value in picking the exact number of games in the series. If we're projecting the Cavaliers to pick up some games, we're essentially saying they're unlikely to get swept.\n\nThere's a decent chance this series goes six or seven games, and bettors can still profit even if they wager on both outcomes.\n\nThe odds for a six-game series are +400, and the odds for seven games are +550. Both options offer value as a half-unit wager.\n\nHere are my betting recommendations for this series (odds via FanDuel):", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Latvia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Shedding_and_Accumulating", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Shedding and Accumulating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/mitchell-tatum-brown-celtics-cavs-e1715025002307.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The Celtics were by then an old team and managed to make the Finals as a four seed, while Los Angeles had Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in addition to Chamberlain, the latter winning the Finals MVP award in a loss, the only time that has happened in the history of the league.\n\nIt was Boston's 11th championship, and that in a span of just 13 years.\n\nUnknown date; Cincinnati,OH, USA; Sam Jones of the Boston Celtics in action against the Cincinnati Royals at Cincinnati Gardens.\n\nMandatory Credit: Photo By Malcolm Emmons-USA TODAY Sports copyright By Malcolm Emmons\n\nUnknown date; Los Angeles, CA, USA; FILE PHOTO; Los Angeles Lakers forward Elgin Baylor is defended by Boston Celtics center Bill Russell (6) at the Forum.

He averaged 11.5 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 1.1 assists.\n\nAndy Lyons /Allsport\n\nIt is also the date of the last game in the old Boston Garden, a 95-92 loss to Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic.\n\nHorace Grant of the Magic scored the last official bucket in that hallowed building, a free throw. The building would sit vacant for three years before demolition in 1998.\n\nFinally, it is the day that former Boston No. 16 overall pick in the 1958 NBA draft Jimmy Smith passed away in 2002.\n\nSmith never played for the Celtics, having hurt his knee while serving in the military. He instead made a career for himself as a civil rights activist and public servant but was widely seen as having very high potential as a player before his injury derailed his career as an athlete.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nToughness means something different to the Boston Celtics Grant Williams opens up on his rep, Mavs, trade to Charlotte Hornets and more Is it better that the Boston Celtics have five days off while they wait to see who their 2024 NBA East semis opponent is?

Back then, Jayson Tatum was a rookie, LeBron James hadn't fled to record \"Space Jam 2\" in Los Angeles, and Brad Stevens was at the helm as Boston's sideline leader with the clipboard in hand.\n\nFast forward six years later and the circumstances have taken a drastic change for both teams. Cleveland no longer rules the East. In fact, the Cavaliers have measured up to be underdog hopefuls as the team capable of making a series interesting, but still challenged with overcoming its baggage.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Celtics shouldn't have an issue making easy work of Cleveland, and booking their ticket to the conference finals:\n\n1. The Cavaliers are undersized and, historically, that never helps\n\nRelying on an undersized lineup -- Donovan Mitchell (6-foot-3), Darius Garland (6-foot-1), Max Strus (6-foot-6), Isaac Okoro (6-foot-5), and Evan Mobley (6-foot-11) -- doesn't do Cleveland any favors.\n\nThe Celtics know first-hand that entrusting an undersized point guard isn't easy. Isaiah Thomas couldn't push Boston over the miraculous hump of the East, and neither could Kemba Walker. Even with the team's current star duo of Jayson Tatum (6-foot-8) and Jaylen Brown (6-foot-6, 220 pounds) having size to their advantage, the Celtics front office still needed to polish the roster by adding 7-foot-2 Kristaps Porzingis as the missing piece this past offseason.\n\nIt's already been a nightmare for most teams to guard Boston throughout the regular season. The Celtics lead the NBA in offensive rating (122.2), 3-pointers made (16.5), and scored 1.22 points per possession, setting an all-time record.\n\nFor the next 48 hours, Cavaliers head coach J.B. Bickerstaff will need to work on establishing a game plan of some sort to counter all of that and prevent the Celtics from repeating their success against Miami in Round 1.\n\n2. Cleveland is below-average in areas that matter\n\nThe Cavaliers displayed their weaknesses throughout the regular season, therefore, the formula for the Celtics is simple: attack the margins which Cleveland typically struggles with.\n\nWhen it comes to ball protection, the Cavaliers are mediocre at best. Cleveland ranks 19th in turnover percentage (13.8) and is prone to making the wrong decision once suffocated by opposing defenses. During the playoffs, the Cavaliers had committed the second-most turnovers (14.7) of any team in the league, begging the question: how will Cleveland handle the pressure of Jrue Holiday and White guarding the perimeter?\n\nBoston has led the postseason in points off turnovers (16.2), routinely making opponents pay for miscues.\n\nWhen the season reached its All-Star Break, the Cavaliers stood at No. 2 in defensive rating (110.3). However, that plummeted to 115.5, placing Cleveland at No. 25 in games played after the midseason intermission, exploiting a previous strength as a significant deficiency.\n\nCleveland experienced another post-All-Star Break downfall, ranking 29th in the league in rebounds (40.2).\n\n3. Boston is operating with a chip on its shoulder -- and that's dangerous\n\nThe weight of the world sits over the shoulders of the Celtics, which doesn't change just because Porzingis is injured -- potentially throughout Round 2.\n\nWhen Boston logged a hiccup performance in Game 2 against Miami, the team responded, flipping the switch on both ends of the floor. It took three straight lopsided victories, each serving as responses from the Celtics for the Heat to cool off and get out of Boston's hair.\n\nThere isn't a team left in the playoffs that should be hungrier, and the Celtics know it themsevles.\n\n\"Just locking in mentally,\" guard Payton Pritchard told reporters during Friday's team practice, per CLNS Media. \"Like I said, talking about the physicality, and all that. So (Miami) just prepared us for what it's gonna be like to try and win this championship. Every round is going to be tougher.\"\n\nCleveland's expectations don't measure up, which could work to its advantage. But that alone won't be enough to lean on once the Celtics step foot on their parquet come Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Boston has been waiting since Wednesday night, when they ended their series against the Miami Heat with a blowout victory in Game 5.\n\nCeltics-Cavaliers Game 1 is set for Tuesday night at TD Garden.\n\nThe Celtics won two of three over the Cavaliers during the regular season, with the home team winning all three showdowns.\n\nThe teams played two games in Boston over a three-night span in mid-December, and the Celtics took both of them. All five Boston starters finished in double figures in scoring in the first matchup, led by 25 apiece by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. Both teams shot the ball well from downtown, with Boston hitting 40.9 percent of its threes and Cleveland knocking down 42.2 percent. But the three-ball wasn't the Celtics' only attack that night, as Tatum and Brown both got to the free-throw line nine times. Boston went a perfect 26-for-26 at the charity stripe, while Cleveland had just nine freebies and six makes.\n\nKristaps Porzingis was huge for Boston that game, scoring 21 points to go with his 10 rebounds and two blocks. A few nights later he dropped 18 points and pulled down six boards, as Tatum led the C's to a 116-107 win with a team-high 27 points. Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell led all scorers with 30 points in a losing effort.\n\nCleveland got its lone win over Boston on March 5 at the Rocket Mortgage Field House, and it was a pretty big win for the Cavs. The Celtics arrived riding an 11-game winning streak and were coming off a 53-point win over the Warriors, but the Cavs emphatically broke that streak by coming back from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter.\n\nDean -- not Dwyane -- Wade outscored the Celtics all by himself in the fourth quarter that night, scoring 20 points with five three-pointers to lead the Cavaliers to a stunning victory. The Celtics scored just 17 points in the final frame as they took their foot off the gas, but still had a shot to win in the end.\n\nTatum had the ball in his hands in the final seconds and appeared draw a foul on Darius Garland as he attempted a game-winning (you could probably guess this) fadeaway as time expired. But the Cavs challenged the call, and officials overturned it when they deemed that Tatum's leg caused the contact and not Garland.\n\nThe Cavaliers won, 105-104, despite not having Mitchell and Evan Mobley leaving the game early with an ankle injury.\n\nTatum led the scoring charge for the Celtics against the Cavs in the regular season, averaging 26 points per game. But he wasn't all that efficient against Cleveland, shooting just 38.7 percent overall and 35.7 percent from three. He needed 20.7 shot attempts per game to get those 26 points.\n\nBrown was second on the Celtics during the regular season at 22.7 points per game against the Cavs, though he was much more efficient, hitting 49.1 percent of his shots. His three-ball wasn't as good, with Brown hitting at just a 35.3 percent clip.\n\nBut the Boston backcourt was red hot from downtown against the Cavs, with Derrick White knocking down 50 percent of his threes and Jrue Holiday draining 42.9 percent of his long-range bids. White is on fire at the moment, after scoring 63 points over the last two games against Miami and shooting 57.7 percent for the series.\n\nOf course, the Celtics will be without Porzingis for this series, which will leave them shorthanded against a pretty talented Cleveland frontcourt. He averaged 21 points and eight boards in his three games against the Cavs, but now Al Horford will have to hold down the fort in the paint.\n\nThe Celtics averaged 120.6 points per game during the regular season, but just 113.3 in their three games against the Cavaliers.\n\nMitchell was a beast in his two games against Boston, averaging 30 points off 50 percent shooting. Garland was a pest with 20.7 points and 7.0 assist per game, and Caris LeVert is a dangerous scorer, averaging 15.7 points in his three games against Boston on 48.6 percent shooting overall and 40 percent from three-point range.\n\nAnd just as a warning to Boston fans: Max Strus, who was super annoying against Boston as a member of the Heat the last two postseasons, will now be looking to do the same as a Cavalier.\n\nThis won't be an easy series for Boston by any stretch, especially against a pretty stingy Cleveland defense and without the services of Porzingis. Plus, Mitchell is a threat to take over a game at any moment. The battle of the backcourts will be an entertaining one, especially whomever Joe Mazzulla sicks Holiday on.\n\nBut the Celtics were locked in Wednesday night and had a few nights to rest up before this one gets underway, and should be able to dispatch the Cavs in 5 or 6 games to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals for the third straight season.\n\nThe Celtics and the Cavaliers have split their previous eight playoff matchups, though the Cavaliers have won the last three meetings: A first-round sweep in 2015 and in the Eastern Conference Finals in both 2017 and 2018. That last time these two teams met, Tatum was a rookie and Brown was in his second NBA season, as the Celtics came up just short of a surprising run to the NBA Finals. (Where they would have gotten smoked by the Warriors.)\n\nThe Cavaliers did have a guy named LeBron on their team in those three previous matchups, and that made a pretty big difference in their favor.\n\nThe Celtics won their postseason series over the Cavaliers in 1976, 1985, 2008, and 2010. Boston made it to the NBA Finals each time they beat the Cavs in the playoffs, winning titles in 1976 and 2008.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors":

As they now gear up for the Boston Celtics, Mitchell wants his team to be ready.\n\nSpeaking to reporters following their massive 106-94 win over the Magic on Sunday, Mitchell pointed out that he and the rest of the Cavs have every right to celebrate the victory. After all, they just completed the biggest comeback in a Game 7 in playoffs history after trailing by as much as 18 points in the said contest. However, the All-Star guard emphasized that they have to quickly regroup after the celebrations and shift their focus on Boston.\n\nThe Celtics are the best team in the East and the NBA, and they are coming off a gentleman sweep of the fiery Miami Heat in the opening round. Having been well-rested and with homecourt advantage, Boston will surely be even harder to beat.\n\nCleveland's job is far from over, and Mitchell wants the rest of the Cavs to keep that in mind.\n\n\"Obviously, we have a tall task in Boston ... We can celebrate this for a few hours, but we don't really have time ... I have no doubt Boston will be just as loud and we come home, it'll be the same thing. I was little upset they chanted we want Boston and DG misses the free throw, but it is what it is. It's a lot of fun, going into a hostile environment ... go get one, or two,\" Mitchell said of facing the Celtics in the second round, per Bobby Manning of CLNS Media.\n\nDonovan Mitchell's challenge for Cavs vs. Celtics\n\nThe Celtics will obviously be favorites against the Cavs, and for good reason. They have a deep roster headlined by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and while Kristaps Porzingis' status in the series is up in the air due to his calf injury, they have more than enough talent to counter whatever the Cavs throw at them.\n\nAs for the Cavs, Donovan Mitchell has been the only consistent source of offense for them. While Darius Garland and Evan Mobley showed flashes of brilliance, they cannot simply pop in and out like they did with the Magic. Against a well-balanced Celtics squad, that's a recipe for disaster.\n\nNot to mention that Jarrett Allen's health is a major concern as he continues to recover from a rib injury.\n\nHaving said that, Mitchell understands that the rest of the Cavs need to step up and improve if they want a shot at pulling off an upset against the Celtics.\n\n\"We can be better. I hate to be that guy, this was great, this was phenomenal ... but we can and will have to be better to beat Boston. No disrespect to Orlando, because they're a phenomenal team ... this was big for us a group, but we don't really have time to celebrate,\" Mitchell furthered.\n\nThe Cavs face the Celtics on Tuesday, so they don't really have much time to relish their Game 7 win. They need to shift their mindset to playing another series, which will certainly be difficult. But that is the reality of the NBA Playoffs. Hopefully, Cleveland will be able to carry the momentum they got from their series win against the Magic and use it to pull off a stunner against the Celtics in Game 1.", "source": {"uri": "cavsnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cavs Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angelo_guinhawa@cavsnation.com", "name": "Angelo Guinhawa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic_and_Regional", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Ethnic and Regional", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.cavsnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Donovan-Mitchell-issues-Celtics-warning-to-Cleveland-after-first-round-win.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Cleveland was pushed to seven games in its first-round series, getting Donovan Mitchell's 39-point performance as fourth-seeded Cleveland extended its season with a clinching 106-94 win over the Orlando Magic on Sunday.\n\n\"This is why I'm here,\" Mitchell said. \"It's my job.\n\n\"I don't mean this disrespectful, but it doesn't really mean much. We didn't come in just to win the first round. We accomplished one goal, now we have to do it again. That's the mindset.\"\n\nMitchell, who has been dealing with a left knee injury all season, scored 50 points during a Game 6 loss at Orlando. He's scored at least 30 points in 23 of his 52 career playoff games,\n\n\"That's what special players do when it matters most,\" Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. \"He was special when he needed to be.\"\n\nBoth teams are expected to be short-handed. Boston center Kristaps Porzingis is likely to miss the entire second round with a right calf injury he sustained during the series against Miami.\n\n\"It's something, not nothing, so it will take a little bit of time, for sure,\" Porzingis said. \"But I'm doing everything I can to speed it up because I want to be back out there as soon as possible. But understanding, like, the worst thing would be probably to reaggravate that. So being smart.\n\n\"You would have to ask the medical people about the specifics of it. I'm kind of just following the plan. But I'm hoping for a return as soon as I start to get better.\"\n\nCleveland center Jarrett Allen has missed the last three games with a rib injury. Allen averaged a career bests with 16.5 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.7 assists in 77 games during the regular season. He averaged 17.0 points and 13.8 rebounds in four playoff games against the Magic.\n\nThe Cavaliers overcame an 18-point first-half deficit in Sunday's clinching victory.\n\n\"We showed a lot of fight,\" Cleveland's Caris LeVert said after scoring 15 points off the bench in Game 7. \"We showed what we've been showing all year long. We just kept fighting.\n\n\"We've been there several times this year, not just games, just as a unit. We've been banged up. We've been injured. But we got a next-man-up mentality and we just never quit.\"\n\nThe Celtics won two of three meetings with the Cavaliers during the regular season. Mitchell didn't play when Cleveland earned a 106-105 victory at home March 5. The Celtics prevailed 120-113 and 116-107 in back-to-back games played at Boston in December.\n\nGame 2 in the best-of-seven series will be played Thursday at Boston.

For as talented as the Magic are, the Celtics project to present an even bigger challenge for the Cavaliers.\n\nAfter Game 7, Mitchell made comments that indicate the Cavaliers are aware of the notion that the Celtics are heavy favorites to come out on top in this series and reach the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nJayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are the straws that stir the drink of Boston's offense. Both players averaged more than 20 points per game in the Celtics' first-round series against the Miami Heat, which they went on to win in five games.\n\nOutside of Brown and Tatum, the Celtics also have a pair of two-way standouts in Derrick White and Jrue Holiday. White and Holiday are two of the best perimeter defenders in the league, so Cavaliers fans shouldn't be surprised if they take the defensive assignments of guarding Mitchell and Garland.\n\nBut on top of being lockdown defenders, both guards are also capable offensive players.

The former All-Star suffered a soleus strain during Game 4 of the opening round of the 2024 NBA postseason and has been sidelined ever since.\n\nSubsequent testing on the calf revealed Porzingis avoided a major injury, and did not hurt his achilles, which is attached to the soleus muscle. Instead, he suffered a mild strain. With the right treatment and patience, this should not keep Porzingis off the court for too long. Porzingis explained he is listening to team doctors and making sure to not rush back to action too quickly and risk worsen the injury. As such, told reporters it is difficult to predict when he will be back, although he is very eager and excited to get back as soon as he can.\n\n\"I'm doing everything I can to speed it up because I want to be back out there as soon as possible.\" Porzingis said of his recovery process.\n\n\"But I'm understanding that the worst thing would be to reaggravate that,\" Porzingis said. \"I'm being smart, but you would have to ask the medical people about the specifics of it.\"\n\n\"I'm kind of just following the plan,\" Porzingis added. \"But I'm hoping for a return as soon as I start to get better.\"\n\nPorzingis was laughing and in good spirits while relaying the information. The Eastern Conference semifinals begin on Tuesday of next week. The big man didn't rule out a return for that series, but was upbeat about that possibility still being unclear.\n\n\"There's no specific date, obviously.\" Porzingis said. \"It's still pretty early.\"\n\n\"Once I start doing more stuff, it'll be clear,\" Porzingis said with a smile. \"But I'm not super close yet.

He hasn't yet begun to practice with the team, however. He explained that he needed to let any inflammation or swelling in the calf subside before he could begin much treatment. In the next few days, he will slowly add to his recovery plan.\n\nThis process will provide more information about the extent of the injury and any timeline for returning to the court. Imaging of the calf isn't able to add precise information about a more mild condition like this.\n\nPorzingis also said this injury is worse than a similar one he dealt with in his other leg earlier this year. He admitted he is very keen to get back into the action, but understands taking a conservative approach and trusting the team around him is critical.\n\n\"The next thing I have to do is to get healthy as soon as possible and follow the plan.\" Porzingis said. \"Just make sure I do everything, and just getting in that mindset because I can't change.\"\n\n\"I'm just looking forward to make quick steps forward towards being back on the court.\" Porzingis added.\n\nListen to the \"Celtics Lab\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3zBKQY6\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3GfUPFi\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3F9DvjQ\n\nCan the Boston Celtics survive their 2024 East semis series without Kristaps Porzingis?

Among those who will not join them are teams who usually do, like the Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat. Among those who believe the Celtics will have it easy going to the NBA Finals is former ex-Lakers guard Nick Young.\n\nYoung posted on his X account that returning to the NBA Finals will be easy for Boston, writing, \"Boston cake walk to the finals,\" on May 2.\n\nThe Celtics' next opponent will either be the Cleveland Cavaliers or the Orlando Magic. The Cavaliers have not won a playoff series since their last year with LeBron James in 2018, and the Magic have not won a playoff series since their days with Dwight Howard back in 2010. Needless to say, neither team is that experienced.\n\nIf they beat either of those teams, their next opponent would either be the Indiana Pacers, who just won their first series since 2014, or the New York Knicks, who haven't been to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1999.\n\nThe Celtics have garnered plenty of experience since pairing Jayson Tatum with Jaylen Brown. They've been to four Eastern Conference Finals, including a Finals appearance in 2022. They have plenty more experience compared to their potential opponents left in the playoffs. It's up to them to prove if that will have any bearing on their playoff chances.\n\nYoung played for the Lakers from 2013 to 2017. The ex-Laker won a title with the Warriors in 2018.\n\nThe Celtics don't have to think about the offseason yet. However, with multiple big men like Luke Kornet and Xavier Tillman set to become free agents, they must consider who could be their replacements. One possibility is ex-Laker Andre Drummond.\n\nBleacher Report's Zach Buckley explained why the Celtics should look into Drummond.\n\n\"If Boston is in the market for a big, Andre Drummond should be on the short list. While he is a limited player away from the basket, he is hyper-active around it. He flirted with a double-double average (9.0 rebounds and 8.4 points) while getting just 17.1 minutes per game this season.\n\n\"With his 31st birthday on the horizon and precious little postseason success behind him, he might be open to ring-chasing on a minimum contract.\"\n\nDrummond played for the Lakers in 2021. The Celtics have expressed interest in Drummond in the past. HoopsHype's Michael Scotto reported that the Celtics made a trade offer to the Bullsat the 2024 NBA Trade Deadline.\n\nOne reason the Celtics could consider Drummond is if they potentially lose one of their free agent big men. Bleacher Report's Grant Hughes explained why the Celtics' toughest decision will be what to do with Luke Kornet and Xavier Tillman.\n\n\"The ninth, Luke Kornet, and 10th, Xavier Tillman Sr., could present Boston with an either/or decision, as it may not be worthwhile to retain a pair of centers on a roster that already has Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is and Al Horford, not to mention Neemias Queta, whom the Celtics viewed as valuable enough to convert to a standard contract in April with a $2.2 million team option for 2024-25,\" Hughes said in a May 2 story.\n\nIf one or both leave,

Game 1 of the Denver Nuggets (#2)/Minnesota Timberwolves (#3) series was an instant classic, the Oklahoma City Thunder (#1)/Dallas Mavericks (#5) matchup promises to be a duel of MVP candidates, and an age-old rivalry is adding a new chapter with the New York Knicks (#2) set to do battle with the Indiana Pacers (#6).\n\nBut the one series everyone seems to have already written off is the one/four matchup between the Boston Celtics (#1) and the Cleveland Cavaliers (#4). Sportsbooks like FanDuel give the Celtics +175 odds of winning the series in five games. And projection models like the one at Opta Analyst only give the Cavaliers a 9.2% chance of emerging from this series victorious.\n\nOn the surface, the lopsidedness of these outlets makes sense. The Celtics swiftly dismissed their first round opponent (the Miami Heat) in a convincing five-game gentleman's sweep, outscoring the injury-riddled Heat by 78 points over the course of the series. Meanwhile, the Cavaliers narrowly escaped the inexperienced Orlando Magic, as the burgeoning bunch took Cleveland to seven games and held them under 100 points in each contest except for two (Games 5 and 7).\n\nHowever, even when you frame the series this way, I still believe that everyone is selling Cleveland short. Now, I'm not saying they will win the series (in fact, I myself predict the Celtics to win). But I do think that they will push Boston a lot further than most people believe they can, and here are four reasons why.\n\nAnyone who really knows basketball will tell you that championships are won by teams, not individual players. With that said, some players (the special ones) have the clout to swing a game or two on their lonesome. And in the playoffs, all it takes is one or two games to change the entire outcome of a series.\n\nDonovan Mitchell is one of those players. If not for injuries, he'd be a shoo-in for an All-NBA First or Second Team spot this year, and what's more, he has a history of leveling his game up during the game's second season. From 2019-21 (17 games), Mitchell averaged 33.9 points and 5.2 assists on 64% true shooting.\n\nHis 2022 and 2023 Playoffs weren't as dazzling, but Mitchell was also dealing with injuries during those cycles. This postseason, Mitchell has gotten back to his ways (despite still being unhealthy). In his final two games against the Magic, Mitchell averaged 44.5 PPG and 4.5 APG on 60.9% true shooting.\n\nAll this is to say that Mitchell is ready for battle, and when he's playing at this level, he has a legitimate chance of being the best player in this series. If that's the case, it gives the Cavaliers a massive advantage, regardless of how talented this Celtics roster may be.\n\nLike we just said, the Celtics are a deep team (at least by playoff standards). Their top 6 players hold up against any team in the association. The problem is that their second-best player will likely be missing the entire series.\n\nI know what you're thinking. Wait, Jaylen Brown isn't injured? You're correct, but I'd posit that Brown isn't Boston's second-best player and that the designation actually belongs to one Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nBrown is a great wing scorer and defender, but his skillset is a little bit redundant when flanking Jayson Tatum (who provides a better version of that player archetype). Porzingis, on the other hand, gives Boston high-level rim protection (arguably the second most valuable skill after on-ball creation) and perimeter spacing that you don't normally get from the center position.\n\nAs I've discussed before (in this article), Porzingis gives Boston a blend of offense and defense at the five spot that they haven't had at any point in the Tatum/Brown era. His two-way impact is a big reason why many one-number metrics (like DRIP) view Porzingis as Boston's second-best player:\n\nNo matter where you stand on the Brown/Porzingis debate, the fact that Boston has to go through this series without their starting center is a major blow. Yes, Boston was 21-4 in the 25 games without Porzingis during the regular season. But the Memphis Grizzlies were 19-6 in the 2021-22 regular season without Ja Morant. Does that mean they could have handled a postseason series without him? Probably not (they went 1-2 in the three playoff games he missed that year).\n\nNow, this year's Celtics is a better team than that Grizzlies team was, but they will still be missing a major piece of their puzzle without Porzingis out there on the court.\n\n(Sidebar: If Jarrett Allen is healthy and ready to go, that gives Cleveland two starting-caliber big men -- Evan Mobley being the other one -- they can weaponize to attack Boston's depleted frontline).\n\nTranscendent stars and unfortunate injuries can turn a series. But you know what else can create major upsets: shooting variance.\n\nFor those who aren't completely aware, shooting variance is the term used to describe the drastic swings in a team's shooting percentages on a game-to-game basis. You see, if a team averages 35% shooting from three, it usually isn't because they shoot around that mark in each of their games. Normally, teams shoot a wide variety of percentages from three (22% one game, 48% the next, etc.), and eventually, over the course of an 82-game season, that number stabilizes to the number that becomes the team's shooting average.\n\nWhile less prone to shooting variance than a single-game March Madness matchup, a best-of-seven playoff series is still a pretty small sample size. As a result, a hot/cold shooting stretch may make/break a team during a playoff series.\n\nWe mention this because teams like the Celtics are particularly susceptible to shooting variance since they take a high volume of 3-pointers (1st in 3-point attempts in the regular season). As a general rule, the more threes you attempt, the higher the likelihood that you experience positive/negative shooting luck. We saw shooting variance bite them in the butt in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Heat (Miami outshot them by 13.1% from three in that series). What if the same problem rears its ugly head in the conference semifinals?\n\nCleveland is also due for a hot shooting stretch. Against Orlando, the Cavaliers shot just 28.7% from three. Cleveland isn't a bad shooting team, though. In the regular season, they averaged 36.7% from downtown and finished 8th in 3-point attempts per game. What happens if Cleveland experiences some positive shooting regression AND Boston has a cold spell? I think things would get pretty interesting.\n\nA part of the Cavaliers' season that isn't getting talked about enough is that they have had to go the last two months without Dean Wade (arguably their best player off the bench).\n\nTo this point, there has been no word about whether or not Wade will even be eligible to play in this series. But if he can, it's an absolute game-changer.\n\nIn the regular season, Wade was in the 96th percentile in Defensive Estimated Plus-Minus (per Dunks & Threes) and the 76th percentile in 3-point shooting percentage (39.1%). Wade gives them a mixture of size (6'9), defense, and shooting that no other player on the roster can match, as evidenced by his presence on four of the team's six best lineups this season.\n\nAdmittedly, this is the weakest one of my four arguments. Given the lack of reporting around his injury, there is a strong chance that he doesn't play a single minute in this series.\n\nBut if Wade can find a way, Mitchell keeps burning like the brightest star in the sky, and the team awakens from the 3-point line, Cleveland becomes the kind of team that could push the Porzingis-less Celtics to the brink of premature elimination.", "source": {"uri":

At the time, Jayson Tatum was a rookie, LeBron James was still in Cleveland and Boston's limping roster -- missing Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward -- took Cleveland to seven games, falling short of an NBA Finals appearance.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Mortgage_FieldHouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hayward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Hayward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/Darius-Garland-Donovan-Mitchell.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

It's the Celtics' fourth playoff series against Cleveland in the past 10 years, with the Cavs winning the previous three in 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nA lot has changed since then, of course: LeBron James took his talents from Cleveland to Los Angeles, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown -- thrust into starting roles during that 2018 series at age 19 and 21, respectively -- have blossomed into All-Stars for Boston.\n\nThe Celtics are the clear favorite this year after a dominant 64-18 regular season, but Kristaps Porzingis' calf injury -- which is expected to sideline him for the entire second round -- could complicate their path, while Donovan Mitchell will be eager to play spoiler against what might be his favorite NBA opponent (more on that later).\n\nSo, how will this one play out? Here's a full series preview featuring a recap of the teams' regular-season matchups, keys to victory for each squad and our series prediction.\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n\nThe Celtics trailed by as many as 15 points early in the teams' first meeting but outscored Cleveland in each of the final three quarters to grind out a home win. Tatum and Brown scored 25 apiece while all five Boston starters reached double digits in a balanced scoring effort.\n\nTwo nights later, the Celtics again fended off a pesky Cavs team led by Donovan Mitchell (31 points, eight rebounds, six assists), Caris LeVert (26 points) and Darius Garland (19 points). In a near-carbon copy of their previous meeting, all five C's starters scored in double figures with Tatum (27 points) and Brown (22 points) leading the way.\n\nThe Celtics led by 22 points entering the fourth quarter and appeared on their way to a season series sweep. Then Dean Wade happened.\n\nThe Cavs role player exploded for 20 points in the fourth quarter, hitting 5 of 5 3-pointers and 7 of 7 shot attempts to help Cleveland storm back for a stunning victory despite playing without Mitchell. Tatum had a chance to win the game on the final possession but missed a last-second jumper as time expired.\n\nAll three of Boston's matchups with the Cavs were decided by fewer than 10 points, suggesting this could be a much more tightly-contested series than Round 1, where the Celtics led by as many as 27 points in all four of their victories over Miami.\n\nHere's how the Celtics and Cavs compared in several notable statistical categories during the regular season, with Boston holding the edge in all but one category. (NBA rank in parentheses.)\n\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();\n\nThey keep two factors consistent: effort and pace.\n\nThe Celtics showed a puzzling lack of the former in their Game 2 loss to the Heat, but responded ratcheting up the defensive intensity in Games 3, 4 and 5. While the Cavs are much more talented offensively than Miami, the C's are almost impossible to beat when they're winning 50/50 balls and are connected defensively.\n\nOn offense, Boston provided a blueprint for success without Porzingis in Game 5 by cranking up the pace and keeping the ball moving, hitting 16 of 40 3-pointers while racking up 23 assists with eight players recording multiple helpers.\n\nThe Celtics were 43-10 this season when they attempted at least 40 3-pointers and 54-11 when they handed out at least 23 assists. When the ball stopped moving and the pace slowed, that's when Boston's offense ran into trouble.\n\nThe one silver lining of Porzingis' absence is that it should force the Celtics to increase their ball movement and push the pace instead of letting Porzingis go 1-on-1 in the post. If they can replicate what we saw in Game 5 against a less physical Cavs team, a spot in the Eastern Conference Finals awaits.\n\nTheir Big Two becomes the Big Three (or Four).\n\nMitchell is a postseason stud who's scored 30 or more points in 22 of his 50 career playoff games, including a 50-piece in Game 6 against the Magic and XX points in the Game 7 clincher. He's also a Celtics killer: His 29.6 points per game against Boston are the most he's scored against any NBA opponent (minimum five games played).\n\nThe Celtics' game plan should start with containing Mitchell and Garland, Cleveland's second-leading scorer and leading assister. But the Cavs have two role players capable of burning the C's: Caris LeVert and Max Strus.\n\nLeVert dropped 26 points on Boston back in December and has scored 40 or more points against the Celtics twice in his career. Strus, meanwhile, drilled eight 3-pointers in a three-game span against Boston as a member of the Heat to help Miami win the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nMitchell is fully capable of winning at least one game on his own, and if he gets help from his supporting cast, that number could increase.\n\nAnother storyline to monitor: Big man Jarrett Allen, who averaged 17 points and 13.8 rebounds in Games 1 through 4 against Orlando, has missed the last three games due to a rib injury. He and fell big man Evan Mobley are both excellent defenders as well who could make it difficult for Boston to score in the paint.\n\nThe Celtics enter the series as heavy favorites. We'll update with exact odds when they become available.\n\nCeltics in six.\n\nThe Cavs aren't the Heat, folks. Mitchell has a proven playoff track record and forms a strong backcourt alongside Garland. Big men Mobley and Allen (if healthy) could give Boston trouble on both ends with Porzingis likely sidelined for the entire series.\n\nThe Celtics are title favorites for a reason, though. They're immensely talented on both ends -- Derrick White's emergence as Boston's third-leading scorer is a game-changer offensively -- and showed impressive focus and maturity in their three consecutive wins over a scrappy Heat team in Round 1.\n\nMitchell may put the Cavs on his back in one game, and the C's may go cold beyond the arc in another. But the Celtics are too good for this series to last longer than six games.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caris_LeVert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caris LeVert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darius Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnne.com/d2174e9d6d506dd546f093f88dd4a570", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Indiana Pacers capitalized on injuries to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard to outperform the Bucks. The Knicks' ability to adjust to the Philadelphia 76ers' gameplans helped them secure the series win. GIVEMESPORT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nFor every first-round exit in the NBA playoffs, there is one team that keeps the dream alive, advancing to the second round. As the playoffs go on, the pool of teams becomes smaller and smaller as only those capable of surviving continue to climb the ladder. The first round of the playoffs has already seen several teams advance.\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers, and Cleveland Cavaliers have all defeated their opposing teams and have advanced to the Conference Semifinals. Unlike the Western Conference, there were no sweeps, with each series going at least six games except for one. This demonstrates the similarity in play and skill level between the Eastern teams.\n\nHowever, there were more complicated matters as to why each team won, rather than being the higher seed. Here is what went right for each Eastern Conference team that advanced to the second round.\n\n1 Boston Celtics Celtics outclassed the Heat due to their sheer level of skill and talent\n\nThe most lopsided series in the Eastern Conference so far in these playoffs has been the one between the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. The Heat were entering the series (and playoffs) as the heavy underdog, while the Celtics came in as the opposite. While Miami was a play-in team, the Celtics finished with the best record in the entire league, at 63-18.\n\nThat figure was seven games higher than the next team in the league, and 18 games higher than the Heat. While Miami knocked off the Celtics in last year's Conference Finals as the underdog, they failed to do so this year. The Celtics' starters and bench were all clicking, and against any team that is lethal, but particularly the Heat, who lacked Jimmy Butler.\n\nThat was a recipe for disaster for the Heat, and a recipe for success for the Celtics. They did what they had to do, and what was expected, and now move on to face the _ in the Conference Semifinals.\n\n2 Indiana Pacers Pacers took advantage of a Bucks squad missing their two superstars\n\nCredit must be given to the Indiana Pacers, who clicked on all cylinders in this series. They outperformed the Milwaukee Bucks on both sides of the ball, mostly thanks to the output of phenomenon Tyrese Haliburton. Their efforts were made slightly easier, however, thanks to the injuries of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Damian Lillard.\n\nWhile Lillard was a factor in this series, Antetokounmpo was not. He sustained a non-contact calf injury on April 9 against the Boston Celtics, and that marked the end of his 2023-24 campaign. A Bucks team without Antetokounmpo is at an automatic disadvantage, and that is what they were in the first round.\n\nAdditionally, Lillard sustained an Achilles injury in Game 3, which kept him sidelined for the next two games. Without their two superstars in the lineup, the Pacers were able to capitalize and took the series in six games. It was an unfortunate series of events of the Bucks which led to their demise in 2024.\n\n3 New York Knicks Knicks adjusted to the 76ers' gameplans each game, resulting in success\n\nThe New York Knicks have garnered a status of being a hard-working, blue-collar squad. Their series against the Philadelphia 76ers was an extremely close, back-and-forth battle, where each game was determined by a close number of points. They never pulled away with a large lead, but found ways to finish off the Sixers when it mattered.\n\nGoing into the series, it was known that Joel Embiid was compromised due to his recovery from knee surgery. He was a factor in the first few games, but the Knicks learned how to defend him, often double-teaming him with Mitchell Robinson and Isaiah Hartenstein, defenders who both matched Embiid in height.\n\nEmbiid was effectively limited for the rest of the series, but at that time, Tyrese Maxey emerged. He single-handedly won Game 5 by executing crucial offense when it mattered, but the Knicks once again adjusted and successfully limited him in Game 6. It was the Knicks' hard-working mentality and ability to adjust on the fly that allowed them to prove they were the better team in this series.\n\n4 Cleveland Cavaliers Donovan Mitchell led the Cavaliers to a first-round win over the Magic\n\nThe closest series in the Eastern Conference was the battle between the Orlando Magic and Cleveland Cavaliers. It was the only series in the first round of the NBA playoffs (of any Conference) to reach seven games, and it would be the Cavaliers to take the critical Game 7 and advance to the next round.\n\nThe Cavs were able to topple over the rising Magic team through their offense, led by Donovan Mitchell. He performed in the series the way Cleveland intended when they traded for him a few offseasons ago, averaging 27 points per game in the seven-game span.\n\nAlthough they started slow in Game 7, the Cavaliers' offense woke up, and they erased a 17 point deficit to come back and take the critical game. It was their production at the opportune moment that got them over the hump, and was the key to their win in the first round.\n\nRelated 2024 NBA Playoffs: What Went Wrong for Each Eastern Conference First-Round Exit Four teams in the Eastern Conference were eliminated in the first round - here's what went wrong for each.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lillard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lillard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-03-may-2024-12-34-pm-3695.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 2924, "textEnd": 2931}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The series win in five games, with a dominant performance in Game 5 (118-84), was a sweet revenge for the Celtics. It was a redemption for Jaylen Brown and Derrick White, who the Heat eliminated on Boston's home floor in the 2023 postseason.\n\nReturning to the present, both teams' offensive efficiency should be set up for an all-time classic that will likely see Mitchell, White, and Brown duke it out against one another, with the potential to steal a game on the road.\n\nThe Cavs and Celtics met three times during the regular season, and the Celtics won two of them.

After the game, the All-Star guard confirmed he wasn't thrilled the crowd was looking ahead to Round 2 with just under a minute still on the clock.\n\n\"I was a little upset they chanted, 'We want Boston,' then DG (Darius Garland) misses the free throw,\" Mitchell said. \"But it is what it is. It's a lot of fun. And going into a hostile environment, we're going to need to pull together, stick together like we have been.\"\n\nMitchell may or may not be aware of what happened to the Miami Heat in Round 1; after Heat fans chanted \"We want Boston!\" in the closing seconds of Miami's play-in tournament win over the Chicago Bulls, Celtics wing Oshae Brissett responded with a warning shot of sorts on his video blog.\n\n\"Keep chanting, 'We want (the) Celtics.' We will continue this conversation after the first round,\" Brissett said.\n\nThe Celtics then backed up Brissett's talk, dismantling the Heat in a five-game series victory in which they led by at least 27 points in each of their four wins.\n\nMany expect the Cavs to suffer a similar fate against the No. 1 seed Celtics, but it sounds like Mitchell is embracing the underdog role ahead of Tuesday's Game 1.\n\n\"For us coming into Boston, I'm pretty sure everybody thinks they're going to come in and kick our ass,\" Mitchell said. \"So for us to continue to stay levelheaded throughout and not listen to y'all (the media) and just be who we are, that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nThe Cavs are a more talented team than injury-riddled Miami, so perhaps we'll see a closer series than Celtics-Heat.

After the game, the All-Star guard confirmed he wasn't thrilled the crowd was looking ahead to Round 2 with just under a minute still on the clock.\n\n\"I was a little upset they chanted, 'We want Boston,' then DG (Darius Garland) misses the free throw,\" Mitchell said. \"But it is what it is.

We will continue this conversation after the first round,\" Brissett said.\n\nThe Celtics then backed up Brissett's talk, dismantling the Heat in a five-game series victory in which they led by at least 27 points in each of their four wins.\n\nMany expect the Cavs to suffer a similar fate against the No. 1 seed Celtics, but it sounds like Mitchell is embracing the underdog role ahead of Tuesday's Game 1.\n\n\"For us coming into Boston, I'm pretty sure everybody thinks they're going to come in and kick our ass,\" Mitchell said. \"So for us to continue to stay levelheaded throughout and not listen to y'all (the media) and just be who we are, that's the biggest thing.\"\n\nThe Cavs are a more talented team than injury-riddled Miami, so perhaps we'll see a closer series than Celtics-Heat.

The veteran big man is dealing with a right soleus strain. His current timeline has tentatively been set at 1-2 weeks. Head coach Joe Mazzulla has stated the medical staff will re-evaluate his progress in a week's time.\n\nDuring a recent episode of ESPN's First Take, the cast debated whether Boston can make it out of the East without Porzingis in the rotation or whether they will need him to successfully make it into the NBA Finals. However, Stephen A. Smith believes the Celtics' chances of success are contingent on Porzingis' health.\n\n\"The Boston Celtics are the best team in the NBA,\" Smith said. \"Best record...They've got a reason for concern because if Porzingis isn't 100%, they've got no shot. They're not winning without Porzingis. It's just that simple. For me, when I look at it from that standpoint. That's what it comes down to.\"\n\nJayson Tatum recently noted how Porzingis is the most important member of Boston's rotation. Porzingis provides floor spacing, rim protection, a post presence, and his height gives the Celtics a different dimension on both sides of the floor.\n\nIf Porzingis can avoid any setbacks with his rehab and injury management, it's logical to expect him back before the NBA Finals. There's a chance is could be before the end of the second round. Nevertheless, the consensus is that Boston will be fine in the coming weeks, but as they get deeper into the postseason, Porzingis' importance will rapidly become apparent.\n\nSubscribe to the \"Celtics Chronicle\" podcast on:\n\nApple Podcasts: https://apple.co/3UAVYRg\n\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/3y0H4Lh\n\nYouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnlPcS\n\nSubstack: https://bit.ly/3WoA0Cf", "source": {"uri": "celticswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celtics Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Take_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Take (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

But this result made no difference. Game 3 of the semifinals was going to be played Saturday regardless, and Porzingis will not be back by then. Perhaps the extra two days of rest will be more helpful for someone like 37-year-old forward Al Horford, however.\n\n\u25aa Last month we published a story about how the Celtics identified and subsequently pursued Sam Hauser as an undrafted free agent target in 2021. That process was important, but Boston's executives stressed that Hauser's development has been more important than their discovery.\n\nThey said his stint with the team's G League affiliate in Maine as a rookie was particularly essential. Coaches there helped Hauser become more comfortable keeping the ball above his shoulders before firing away quickly, a style perfected by Warriors star Klay Thompson. Hauser also became more adept at shooting on the move and after peeling off screens.\n\n\"He'd shown us enough over the first half of his G League season that we weren't sitting there going, 'Oh, if we throw him in, we hope we does OK,' \" Celtics assistant general manager Dave Lewin said. \"We knew he was a player. Anyone who watched the G League closely knew Sam could contribute.\"\n\nHauser made 197 3-pointers for the Celtics this season.\n\n\u25aa Boston's semifinal matchup against the Cavaliers is not all that spicy, but it should be more competitive than their first-round win over the extremely undermanned Heat. Porzingis's injury levels the playing field a bit, but Cleveland center Jarrett Allen has missed the last three games because of a rib injury and his status for Game 1 on Tuesday is unclear.\n\nAllen averaged 16.5 points and 10.5 rebounds per game this season and is an excellent rim protector. With the absence of Porzingis, a long-range threat, Allen would be able to patrol the paint more freely.\n\nThe Celtics went 2-1 against Cleveland during the regular season, with the home team winning all three games and each decided by single digits. Also, the Cavaliers had a similar core last season, when they went 3-1 against Boston. This will be the first playoff matchup between these teams since the 2018 conference finals, when Jayson Tatum was a rookie and LeBron James still played for Cleveland.\n\n\u25aa Potentially awkward timing: Tom Brady's Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony will be held on June 12 from 7-9:30 p.m. That is the same night as Game 3 of the NBA Finals.\n\n\u25aa Tales from South Beach: It was a beautiful morning in Miami before Game 4 of the Celtics' first-round series against the Heat last Monday, so I took a walk on a paved path near the waterfront. I reached the end and made a right turn toward Biscayne Bay when I noticed some people pointing their cellphone cameras up at a leafy tree.\n\nThere, dancing from branch to branch and munching on something the tree had grown, was a small monkey. I've been to Miami countless times thanks to the Celtics' tendency to face the Heat in the playoffs so often, and I had never seen a monkey in a tree there. I felt somewhat uneducated about the area's wildlife, and I wondered if children nearby were getting a bit too close to this seemingly wild animal.\n\nThen I looked over and saw a man on a bike directly beneath the tree holding food in the air. He seemed surprisingly comfortable. Then I noticed the monkey was wearing a diaper. Yes, it was the man's pet. He had taken his monkey out for a walk and a tree climb.

And while Boston won two of its three head to head matchups against Cleveland this past season, the Cavs won the most recent showdown between the two teams, erasing a 22-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Celtics 105-104 on March 5.\n\nNevertheless, Boston remains a heavy betting favorite to beat Cleveland in their second-round series, with DraftKings listing the Celtics as a -1200 favorite to win the series with the Cavs being a +800 underdog. That projects an implied 92.31 percent chance of Boston winning the series and advancing to what would be its fourth consecutive appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that Jefferson has his own personal connection to the series, having spent two seasons playing in Cleveland during his 17-year NBA career. The Arizona product was a fan favorite during his time with the Cavs and a key contributor to the team's NBA championship-winning season in 2016.\n\nAt this point, it's unclear whether Jefferson's prediction was made with his head or his heart or if he was simply having some fun on social media following Cleveland's series-clinching win on Sunday. In any event, it's unlikely he'll have much company in picking the Cavs to beat the Celtics, considering the latter's favorite as such an overwhelming favorite in the series.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_axelrod@thecomeback.com", "name": "Ben Axelrod", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swingman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swingman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_20019020_168384754_lowres-scaled-e1714944250931.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-05", "textStart": 801, "textEnd": 808}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Jubiliant fans at Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse spent the final minutes chanting \"we want Boston\" because that's just what fans do and they are entirely right to prefer the season keep going rather than end. Heck, it's not even that interesting of an event, even though the Celtics are heavily favorites to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nBut Boston reserve forward Oshae Brisset found the development intriguing enough to post about, saying \"hear the chants\" with one of those eye-covering emojis available on X, formerly Twitter. Then he deleted it, which doesn't do much good after enough people see it.\n\nBrisset played six minutes in the Celtics' opening round victory over the Miami Heat. He's not expected to be a major factor in the battle against Cleveland either. Or perhaps that's changed after a routine chant awakened a sleeping giant.\n\nThere are no real rules for this but it does seem like most people are already operating on the sensible plane when it comes to in-arena proclamations about wanting to play whatever team is next on the schedule. Which is that it's entirely fine.

Yeah, just because I feel like there were some great years in those four years I was there.\"\n\nGrant Williams is grateful for the time that he had with the Celtics, but he was a little underwhelmed with one aspect of his return to Boston in April.\n\nThe now Hornets forward said he was \"disappointed\" by not receiving a tribute video from the Celtics. Instead, the Celtics gave him a simple \"Welcome Back, Grant Williams\" message on the video board before showing him on the bench as he inactive for that game.\n\n\"I didn't get a tribute video,\" Williams said on \"The Cedric Maxwell Podcast.\" \"I was like, 'Dang.'\"\n\nWilliams was one of a handful of notable Celtics players to make their returns to TD Garden this season after being traded in the 2023 offseason. Marcus Smart received a tribute video and was honored as a \"Hero Among Us\" for the work he did in the Boston community during his nine seasons with the Celtics.\n\nHowever, Robert Williams and Malcolm Brogdon didn't receive a tribute video when the Trail Blazers visited the Celtics in April. Even though both players were inactive, they were on the Trail Blazers' bench for that game. But Williams requested not to receive a tribute video, according to The Boston Globe's Adam Himelsbach. They acknowledged him though with a similar \"Welcome Back\" message.\n\nGrant Williams said he understood if the Celtics were following a precedent, but he still felt a little upset.\n\n\"As much as I was involved in the community, loved Boston, and the organization, I think they were just trying to be consistent with what they had done prior,\" Williams said. \"Was I a little bit disappointed? Yeah, just because I feel like there were some great years in those four years I was there. I was a kid when I was drafted there and I was a kid that grew up there. Hopefully, I was able to help go through things that helped them get to the point where they are now.\"\n\nStill, Williams felt \"thankful\" just to receive any sort of recognition when he returned.\n\n\"You've got to have some gratitude because they could've just not done anything,\" Williams said. \"Even though it was just a, 'Thank you, Grant,' that's something that could be standard across the league. But it definitely kind of surprised me.\"\n\nThe Celtics have had a tribute video controversy in the past. After being traded to the Cavaliers in 2017, Isaiah Thomas requested that the Celtics hold their tribute video for him in a game he would be healthy to play in. That initially coincided with Paul Pierce's number retirement ceremony, with the Celtics great requesting that he have the day to himself.\n\nIt didn't matter in the end as Thomas was traded before that scheduled return and eventually received his own tribute video.\n\nIt doesn't appear that there will be a similar controversy this time around as Williams also expressed his gratitude for Celtics fans.\n\n\"There was nothing but love in the arena,\" Williams said of his return to TD Garden. People were saying, 'Come back' and 'We want you back.' They were like, 'You'll be the next Al, we trade you and you come back two years later or [Daniel] Theis.'\n\n\"It felt refreshing.\"\n\nWilliams had a rocky first year away from Boston. He began the season in Dallas, agreeing to a sign-and-trade to join the Mavericks as they hoped he could provide some defensive help. But that didn't work out as there were rumors that he clashed with Mavericks teammate Luka Doncic.\n\nThe Mavericks traded Williams to the Hornets at the trade deadline in February. Williams scored 13.9 points and grabbed 5.1 rebounds per game in 29 games with Charlotte.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_roche@boston.com", "name": "Conor Roche", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grant Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meek_Mill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meek Mill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portland Trail Blazers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Maxwell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Maxwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Smart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Smart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Brogdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Brogdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_Thomas_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaiah Thomas (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Theis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Theis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pierce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pierce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/S5ZKODCZKUQV3RUO634OARDAH4-6637c9e96e8a7-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

The team won the championship and received multiple individual accolades, with Larry Bird winning MVP and Bill Walton winning Sixth Man of the Year. That kind of success has made Larry claim that it was the best team ever.\n\n\"I've always felt and still feel that's the best team I've ever seen in this league. I'm sure Magic got a team he would like to put against it,\" Larry said in an uncut interview from 1991. \"To me personally, I thought that's the best team ever assembled since I've been in the league.\"\n\nWhat made the '86 Celtics so good?\n\nThe '86 Celtics' success should always be linked to Bird's excellence. He won his third consecutive MVP by averaging 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.2 assists per game while playing all 82 games. He was superb during that year, as he dominated every opponent he played against while continuing to maximize the rest of the team.\n\nRemember that Bird was superbly efficient, shooting 49.6% from the field, 42.3% from beyond the arc, and 89.6% from the charity stripe. It was the quintessential Larry campaign that showcased his excellence as one of the best to lace some sneakers.\n\nHowever, the Hick from French Lick wasn't alone in his quest, as he had one of the best-supporting casts you could ever ask for. Kevin McHale was a 21.3-point per-game scorer, empowering the team's offensive potency. Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, and Danny Ainge completed the starting lineup. Everyone scored in double-digits, which made defenses struggle against them on a nightly basis.\n\nWhile the Celtics' bench was not spectacular, former MVP Bill Walton became a superb backup for Parish and McHale. He played his role well, securing the 6MOY award because he was a reliable player.\n\nThe '86 Celtics are still arguably the best now\n\nEver since that season, there have been teams that have competed at the highest level and are arguably better than the Celtics. The 1995/96 Bulls come to mind, as they secured a 72-10 record in the regular season and won the championship.\n\nThe 73-9 Warriors from the 2015/16 season lost in the NBA Finals, and the 2016/17 Dubs also have a case. The latter didn't have the highest wins total that year, but in terms of overall talent, they were leagues above everyone else.\n\nBird pointed out the '86 Celtics are the best, but the debate still rages on, and it's only proof that the NBA is still the highest level of basketball. Teams possibly exceeding that Celtics campaign is an indicator that the league is constantly evolving and improving.\n\nRelated: \"There is only one man that can guard me, and that's God\" - Robert Parish shares epic Larry Bird trash-talking story", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cholo_martin_magsino@postandcourier.com", "name": "Cholo Martin Magsino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Larry Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Walton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Sixth_Man_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McHale_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin McHale (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Parish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Parish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Ainge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Danny Ainge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/b1/bb163a30-97f9-5128-84c9-7e6135d29f8c/66381ab2c8d19.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538320", "eventUri": "eng-9538320", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nIt's been no secret for just about the whole 2023-24 NBA season that the Boston Celtics are the team to beat.\n\nThey've had the lowest odds all season and things have only gotten easier for them with the Bucks and 76ers falling in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nWhat are their odds to reach the NBA Finals now? What're their odds to win banner No. 18? Let's take a look ahead of their Eastern Conference Semifinals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nREAD: Best NBA Playoffs Betting Apps & SitesREAD: Updated 2024 NBA Finals odds 2024 Boston Celtics odds for Eastern Conference Playoffs, NBA Finals: Celtics nearly out of plus-money territory to win NBA Title Boston Celtics odds to win 2024 NBA Finals: (+115 or better)\n\nThe Celtics are as low as +100 on some books and should see it dip into minus-money range once they inevitably get past the Cleveland Cavaliers and see who they'll face in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWhether it's the Knicks or Pacers, the Celtics should have no problem getting past them and advancing to their second NBA Finals in three years.\n\nBoston's biggest challenge of the playoffs should be who it'll face in the NBA Finals. The early favorites to meet the Celtics were the reigning champion Denver Nuggets, but a Game 1 loss to the Timberwolves in the Western Semifinals has oddsmakers flipping to take Minnesota to advance to the WCFs.\n\nIf that's the case, Boston's odds should skyrocket to even heavier favorites than they have been to get their 18th championship.\n\nThe T-Wolves, Thunder or Mavericks would all be formidable opponents for the Celtics, but their inexperience this deep into the playoffs -- plus other weaknesses -- would be too much for Boston to exploit.\n\n2024 Eastern Conference Champion odds: Boston Celtics (-270 or better)\n\nA healthy Bucks or 76ers team would have been the biggest threats to the Celtics sprint toward the Eastern Conference crown.\n\nHowever, Giannis Antetokounmpo missed all of the first round, Damian Lillard got hurt then either missed time or played injured for Milwaukee; and Philly's Joel Embiid played with a compromised knee for the whole series against the Knicks.\n\nInstead, it's up to the Cleveland, Indiana or New York to keep the Celtics from what's been expected of them all season.\n\nTo put it lightly, the Pacers won't have the defense to keep the Celtics down, the Knicks won't have the offense and the Cavaliers won't have either -- specifically if Jarrett Allen remains out and can't man the middle for them.\n\nOverall, the Knicks probably would've had the best chance if Julius Randle was available and Bojan Bogdanovic didn't get hurt against Philly.\n\nIt's all but set for the Celtics to raise the Bob Cousy Trophy.\n\nCeltics vs. Cavaliers best bet: Celtics -2.5 series spread (-170 or better)\n\nIt took a franchise playoff-record 23 3-pointers for the Heat to take down the Celtics in Boston during Game 2 of Round 1. You can also tack on Miami just having Boston's number in recent playoff history to this one considering they did it all without Jimmy Butler.\n\nBut it was otherwise an open-and-shut series for the Celtics, who finished the Heat off in five games.\n\nThe Cavaliers are coming off an exhausting seven-game series with Orlando that came down to home-court advantage, with the home team winning every game.\n\nThe C's went 37-4 at home this season, while the Cavs were 22-19 on the road. The Celtics beat the Cavaliers by an average of 8 points in their two matchups in Boston. It took six 3-pointer by Dean Wade off the bench to give Cleveland a 105-104 win over Boston at home.\n\nRespectfully, Boston should be up 2-0 once the series shifts to Cleveland, but we'll give the Cavaliers a chance at winning one of the two home games and the series finishing in Boston for Game 5, at the latest.\n\n2024 NBA playoff props: Underdog DFS promo code BETFPB for basketball prop betting\n\nSome legal betting states do allow NBA prop betting, but it's much more widespread at a DFS site such as Underdog, which offers $100 guaranteed bonus when registering with our Underdog NBA promo code BETFPB when signing up.\n\nUnderdog DFS allows you to choose Higher or Lower on NBA props, similar to an over/under.

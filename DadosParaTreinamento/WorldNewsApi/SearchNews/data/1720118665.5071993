Dr Ben Beska, 33, from Newcastle, said he saw a group of magpies squawking in his garden on Saturday and went out to investigate when he spotted the fish lying in the grass. Acting quickly, the NHS cardiology doctor retrieved the animal and placed it in a freezer drawer filled with water, saying it was the only large vestibule he had to hand at the time. Locking the fish away from his two cats, Dr Beska visited his nearest aquatic shop and purchased a tank for the fish \u2013 who has now been named Alice after a text message he sent to a friend regarding the animal autocorrected from \u2018it\u2019s alive\u2019 to \u2018it\u2019s alice\u2019. His initial post of the goldfish lying in the grass has earned over 16 million views on X, formerly Twitter, which Dr Beska said was \u201cbonkers\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty mad really, finding a fish on the lawn. I have no idea how it got in the garden,\u201d Dr Beska told the PA news agency. \u201cThe thing that alerted me to something being outside was the magpies squawking in the garden, so I looked out the window and thought \u2018why are they doing that?\u2019 \u201cThen I saw this thing on the floor and I was like, \u2018what the hell?\u2019 \u201cI went out and I was like, as if it\u2019s an actual fish, so took a photo to send to my fianc\u00e9 to say \u2018how the hell is there a fish on the floor\u2019, and then it moved \u2013 I couldn\u2019t just leave it.\u201d Dr Beska said he picked up the \u201cflapping\u201d fish and found an old freezer drawer which he filled with water. \u201cIt started to swim around so it was alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI locked my cats out of the kitchen, obviously, I didn\u2019t want them to eat it, that would have been a terrible end to the story.\u201d He then went to a nearby shop and purchased a tank and some chemicals, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough time to research and Google things, because there\u2019s a fish in the garden. \u201cI put it in the tank and it\u2019s doing much better than it was on the lawn. \u201cI think it was seconds from death, so it\u2019s a lucky fish.\u201d Dr Beska suspected a bird had picked up the fish from a nearby pond and dropped it while carrying it away, but he said there was no ponds close by and thought it must have travelled a \u201creasonable distance\u201d. The mystery of the goldfish has gone viral on X, with Dr Beska\u2019s original photo gaining over 150,000 likes with more than 4,000 comments. On going viral, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s very odd, I mainly use (X) for medical stuff, so this is very, very different. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite funny, some of the comments are quite funny and about 1,000 people said they thought a bird dropped it.\u201d One X user has even gone as far as creating a separate account for the fish, with the username @alicebeska, which Dr Beska said was \u201cvery funny\u201d. One post on the account for the fish reads: \u201cSuch a wild day, booked one of those @journeetrips and wound up in some northerner\u2019s lawn? I would like a refund please.\u201d Dr Beska now intends to keep the fish as a pet, with plans to purchase a larger tank and possibly another fish to keep it company.", "summary": "Dr Ben Beska has named the fish Alice after a text to a friend regarding the animal autocorrected from \u2018it\u2019s alive\u2019 to \u2018it\u2019s alice\u2019.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/alice-nhs-newcastle-google-b1161570.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/02/13/02121548-b312dd27-3a64-4fb5-99e6-0356208f47d5.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:01:31", "author": "Hannah Cottrell", "authors": ["Hannah Cottrell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.732}

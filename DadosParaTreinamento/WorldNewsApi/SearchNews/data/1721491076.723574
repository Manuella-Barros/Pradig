{"id": 237212066, "title": "Something Different to help businesses stand out", "text": "After 20 years working for global agencies, Kiwi Gareth O\u2019Connor has created Something Different, a new venture which aims to make business strategies simple and easy to implement. O\u2019Connor\u2018s work experience most recently includes running Harvey Cameron, with previous roles at Mindshare, Starcom, Whybin\\TBWA, and PHD. O\u2019Connor says in most industries, there\u2019s a sea of sameness, where companies offer similar products and services, present and package them, and communicate about them in similar ways. \u201cThis makes it challenging for businesses to stand out, differentiate themselves and gain an edge over the competition, hindering potential customers\u2019 ability to recognise and choose them. Something Different exists to help guide businesses to find their something different.\u201d He emphasises that it\u2019s not merely about being different for the sake of it: \u201cI called my company Something Different because, with over 20 years of experience, I know the power and impact of creating distinctive and different brands with products, services, communications, and advertising to match. If everyone in your category follows the same playbook, set yourself apart by doing something different, something distinctive, something that demands attention.\u201dO\u2019Connor wants to help clients build solid foundations based on the best knowledge and wisdom the industry has to offer and make effective strategies simpler and easier to implement. He says while his focus will be on strategy, he has partnered with a few experienced, talented, and trusted people in research, design, creative, production, and media to lend their expertise if required.", "summary": "<p>After 20 years working for global agencies, Kiwi Gareth O'Connor has created Something Different, a new venture which aims to make business strategies simple and easy to implement.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz/news/something-different-to-help-businesses-stand-out/\">Something Different to help businesses stand out</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stoppress.co.nz\">stoppress.co.nz</a>.</p>", "url": "https://stoppress.co.nz/news/something-different-to-help-businesses-stand-out/", "image": "https://stoppress.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gareth-OConnor-702x459.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:44:38", "author": "StopPress Team", "authors": ["StopPress Team"], "language": "en", "source_country": "nz", "sentiment": 0.554}

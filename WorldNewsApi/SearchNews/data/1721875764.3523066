Slap! The new NDP leader says the party he now leads has \u201cmassively out-organized\u201d the UCP and he claims the governing party \u201cis not in any way united.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t build a movement as the UCP has done that is only focused on power.\u201d He says people \u201cwant a better and more welcoming Alberta, an Alberta with pragmatic and smart and thoughtful government.\u201d How does he see the next three years in the political trenches? \u201cI haven\u2019t been on social media yet. I wonder what they\u2019ve said already.\u201d He continues. \u201cOnly for you, Rick. Only for you. We can talk a little bit politically. \u201cOf course, they\u2019re going to come out and try and define me in their terms. Let them try. I have a record of 11 years that defines me very, very well.\u201d That\u2019s 11 years as mayor of Calgary. Another newshound asks if people will tire of Nenshi going back and forth with Smith since the election isn\u2019t until the fall of 2027. \u201cLook, no one can ever get tired of me. I am endlessly fascinating to myself and Rick Bell.\u201d Nenshi figures he is living rent-free in my head.

Virginia this morning.\n\nThe growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US.\n\nAt Oxford protest leaders, who have named their camp a 'Liberated Zone' have pinned up a board with a list of six demands to university chiefs, including to 'boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation', to 'disclose all finances', 'stop banking with Barclays', help rebuild Gaza's education system and 'divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation'.\n\nAlongside this they have argued that 'Oxford men orchestrate occupation', naming Alfred Milner and Cecil Rhodes as evidence, and that 'Oxford men facilitate genocide'.\n\nOxford and Cambridge University have been approached for comment.\n\nThis followers other Russell Group universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle have pitched tents and erected anti-Israel signs as they call for an end to military action in the Gaza strip.\n\nStudents from Manchester University filled nearby Brunswick Park with banners, plaques and Palestinian flags to call for the university to 'end it's partnership with systems which support Israel'.\n\nIn coordination with organisers at Cambridge, students have set up a base on the lawn of King's College because the university 'supports Israel 's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza' (above)\n\nThe growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US\n\nOne banner read: 'UOM blood on your hands', while another claimed: 'UOM supports Israeli Genocide.'\n\nIn Bristol, hand-painted banners were erected between tents, emblazoned with messages of defiance as students lobbied their university to cut ties with arms companies and back calls for a ceasefire as the war rages on in the Levant.\n\nLarge crowds have also been forming in Newcastle, as students say their protest will 'highlight the institution's investment strategy and its complicity in the Israeli military's war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank'.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said police will 'have our full support' to tackle potential disorder if students attempt to replicate the violent demonstrations recently seen at US university campuses.\n\nLast night Jewish community leaders urged universities to shut down encampments over fears Jewish students may be 'harassed and excluded'.\n\nThe spokesman for No 10 said: 'We have always been clear that Jewish students must feel safe on campuses and whilst our universities rightfully pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity it is obviously absolutely clear that any antisemitism shouldn't be tolerated.\n\n'We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest but clearly people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption.\n\n'Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed.'", "source": {"uri":

Pictured: Protesters at Oxford chanting\n\nThe action comes after weeks of protests in American universities, with dozens of students arrested at the University of Virginia this morning.\n\nThe growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US.\n\nAt Oxford protest leaders, who have named their camp a 'Liberated Zone' have pinned up a board with a list of six demands to university chiefs, including to 'boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation', to 'disclose all finances', 'stop banking with Barclays', help rebuild Gaza's education system and 'divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation'.\n\nAlongside this they have argued that 'Oxford men orchestrate occupation', specifically blaming Alfred Milner and Cecil Rhodes, and that 'Oxford men facilitate genocide'.\n\nIn a video published on X the group at Oxford can be heard chanting: ' We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now now now.'\n\nA spokesperson at Oxford University told MailOnline there is 'no place for intolerance' and the protest must be carried out with 'respect, courtesy and empathy'.\n\nBut adding that: 'We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests.\n\n'Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the University community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised.\n\n'The Natural History Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum remain open.'\n\nCampers at Cambridge have argued that their university is 'complicit in Genocide' because of its 'financial and academic ties' to Israel.\n\nIt claimed: 'Cambridge University has over $46 million in defense industry partnerships, contributing to the manufacture of weapons that Israel has used to kill over 40,000 Palestinians, 40 per cent of whom are children, and to destroy every university in Gaza.'\n\nCambridge University has also been approached for comment.\n\nOXFORD: students have set up a base on the lawn of King's College because the university 'supports Israel 's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'\n\nOXFORD: The growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US\n\nThis followers other Russell Group universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle have pitched tents and erected anti-Israel signs as they call for an end to military action in the Gaza strip.\n\nStudents from Manchester University filled nearby Brunswick Park with banners, plaques and Palestinian flags to call for the university to 'end it's partnership with systems which support Israel'.\n\nOne banner read: 'UOM blood on your hands', while another claimed: 'UOM supports Israeli Genocide.'\n\nIn Bristol, hand-painted banners were erected between tents, emblazoned with messages of defiance as students lobbied their university to cut ties with arms companies and back calls for a ceasefire as the war rages on in the Levant.\n\nLarge crowds have also been forming in Newcastle, as students say their protest will 'highlight the institution's investment strategy and its complicity in the Israeli military's war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank'.\n\nAt Newcastle University campers were entertained by a Palestinian DJ and received regular food supplies, as well as being given vouchers for free drinks at the university bar.\n\nNEWCASTLE: Large crowds have also been forming in Newcastle, as students say their protest will 'highlight the institution's investment strategy and its complicity in the Israeli military's war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank'\n\nNEWCASTLE: The protest at Newcastle is one of a growing number on campuses at Russell Group universities across the UK\n\nAt Newcastle University campers were entertained by a Palestinian DJ and received regular food supplies, as well as being given vouchers for free drinks at the university bar\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said police will 'have our full support' to tackle potential disorder if students attempt to replicate the violent demonstrations recently seen at US university campuses.\n\nThe Jewish community leaders urged universities to shut down encampments over fears Jewish students may be 'harassed and excluded'.\n\nThe spokesman for No 10 said: 'We have always been clear that Jewish students must feel safe on campuses and whilst our universities rightfully pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity it is obviously absolutely clear that any antisemitism shouldn't be tolerated.\n\n'We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest but clearly people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption.\n\n'Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors":

Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony,\" the university said in a statement. \"We are eager to all come together for our graduates and celebrate our fellow Columbians as they, and we, look ahead to the future. We will share more in the coming days.\"\n\nColumbia, the epicenter of pro-Palestinian campus protests, is at least the second school to cancel its main graduation ceremony. The University of Southern California canceled its main commencement on April 25th after police broke up an encampment and caused campus shutdown.\n\nAs the demonstrations continue, so does the war in Gaza. On Monday, the Israeli military began warning Palestinians to leave Rafah, a densely crowded city in southern Gaza where Israel has long said it will launch an offensive, even as the Biden administration and the international community has urged against it.\n\nMore: A Columbia professor wanted to document history. NYPD arrested him outside his home\n\nEncampments established at Oxford and Cambridge University\n\nOverseas, pro-Palestinian encampments were erected on the campuses of Oxford and Cambridge on Monday as students and organizers call on the universities to sever financial ties to Israel.\n\nOxford Action For Palestine, the organizing group leading the demonstration at Oxford, said in a statement that an encampment was established at 4 a.m. on the lawn outside of Pitts River Museum on the university's campus. The group's demands include that Oxford disclose its investments, land holdings and grants; divest from all \"arms companies\"; divest from all companies involved in the war in Gaza; and end its relationships with universities in Israel.\n\nAt Cambridge, students set up tents and banners outside King's College on Monday. Cambridge for Palestine, the organizers leading the protest, called on the university to divest from Israel and demanded a meeting with the school's leadership.\n\nPrinceton University students hold hunger strike\n\nStudents at Princeton University began a hunger strike in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, calling for the Ivy League school to divest from Israel.\n\n\"Participants will abstain from all food and drink (except water) until our demands are met,\" said a statement from organizers. \"We commit our bodies to [the] liberation of Palestine. PRINCETON, hear us now! We will not be moved!\"\n\nThe university told CNN that university physicians were monitoring the group and were offering the students health information and medical support. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nPrinceton is not the first university where hunger strikes over the war in Gaza have occurred. Last month, students at the University of South Florida launched such a strike for more than two weeks before it ended after two students were hospitalized.

The group's demands include that Oxford disclose its investments, land holdings and grants; divest from all \"arms companies\"; divest from all companies involved in the war in Gaza; and end its relationships with universities in Israel.\n\nAt Cambridge, students set up tents and banners outside King's College on Monday. Cambridge for Palestine, the organizers leading the protest, called on the university to divest from Israel and demanded a meeting with the school's leadership.\n\nStudents at Princeton University began a hunger strike in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, calling for the Ivy League school to divest from Israel.\n\n\"Participants will abstain from all food and drink (except water) until our demands are met,\" said a statement from organizers. \"We commit our bodies to [the] liberation of Palestine. PRINCETON, hear us now! We will not be moved!\"\n\nThe university told CNN that university physicians were monitoring the group and were offering the students health information and medical support. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nPrinceton is not the first university where hunger strikes over the war in Gaza have occurred. Last month, students at the University of South Florida launched such a strike for more than two weeks before it ended after two students were hospitalized.

I was pushed and shoved and felt quite scared.\n\n'But I wanted these people to know that the Jewish people will never be defeated and we stand with Israel.'\n\nMr Vladimir is a first year history student at Christ's College who comes from New York.\n\nHe said that he was alone because many of his fellow Jewish students feel 'intimidated,' and were too scared to join him.\n\nHe added: 'A lot of Jewish students on campus feel quite scared. They are just keeping their heads down. But I had to take a stand.\n\n'This encampment is going to make Jewish students even more concerned. How would you feel walking past people who are supporting Hamas?'\n\nDuring the rally, protestors shouted: 'Israel is a terror state,' and 'From the river to the sea.'\n\nAri said: 'I think protest is fine, but I just want to say my own peace as well. Their needs to be better organisation because I was pushed, I was grabbed, and I might have just got lucky. '\n\nNo police were present at the encampment or rally, something Ari thinks would have 'made him feel safer' and given more protection to counter protestors.\n\nAri added: ' I have to walk through here all the time. I'm still recognisably Jewish and I would not feel safe'.\n\nAround 20 people are pitching at the encampment, with teaching staff and PHD students among the cohort of protestors from the University.\n\nThe string of tents sit on a patch of grass on King's Parade, a central route through the city and a tourist hotspot near King's College.\n\nStudents are being delivered food and have an 'emergency toilet' despite being able to freely walk in and out to their nearby student accommodation.\n\nOXFORD: Students put up a sign listing their six demands at their 'Liberated Zone' camp\n\nOXFORD: They say 'will not rest until their demands are met', with study tents, toilet facilities, and food making areas already in place\n\nMahmood, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and an organiser of the Cambridge encampment said: 'It's predominately students but we are supported massively by the community. We've just had a couple from Norwich give us \u00a3500 worth of vouchers to buy food later on.'\n\nHe said: 'We actually have a surplus of people reaching out to us to be involved'.\n\nWhile it is exam season at the university another protestor, who did not give his name, said that students are 'realising there's a bigger thing going on' and want to take 'action now, not when exams are finished'.\n\nSecurity presence was concentrated on the other side of King's Parade near Senate House, a ceremonial building where students graduate.\n\nThe building, which has been targeted by Just Stop Oil and has been occupied by other activist groups in recent years, was patrolled by University security guards and three unmarked Metropolitain police cars were stationed outside for a short time- though it is unclear why.\n\nAt around 8am on Bank Holiday Monday, students pitched tents outside the Pitts Rivers museum in Oxford as they demanded an end to violence in Gaza and the release of hostages. By lunchtime around 70 students have pitched up at the camp.\n\nAt the same time, Cambridge students armed with tents, gazebos and sleeping bags set up on the front lawn of King's College in protest against 'Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'.\n\nThe sit-in protests, which echo protests seen in the US, have sprung up at other British universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle over the last week.\n\nAt Oxford's camp, named the 'liberated zone', students pinned up a board of six demands including calls to boycott Israeli genocide, stop banking with Barclays and help rebuild Gaza's education system.\n\nCambridge for Palestine said it will 'not move' from the encampment until the university agrees to four demands including disclosing financial ties with complicit organisations and protecting students at risk.\n\nThe protests seek to emulate those seen at American universities in recent weeks, where more than 130 college campuses have been targeted by pro-Palestine supporters.\n\nOxford and Cambridge encampments: What are the protesters' demands?\n\nStudents staging encampment protests in solidary with Gaza have put up a lengthy list of demands, and vowed they 'will not move' until these are met.\n\nCambridge for Palestine's four demands are:\n\n1. Disclose: Financial and professional ties with complicit organisations.\n\n2. Divest: Funds and collaborations away from such organisations.\n\n3. Reinvest: In Palestinian students, academics and scholars.\n\n4. Protect: Students at risk, and become a university of sanctuary.\n\nOxford students have pinned up a board with a list of six demands to university bosses. These are:\n\n1. Boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\n\n2. Disclose all finances.\n\n3. Stop banking with Barclays.\n\n4. Help rebuild Gaza's education system.\n\n5. Divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\n\n6. Overhaul the university's investment policy.\n\nThese have resulted in growing disorder and unrest, with more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nAs Gaza protests continue to grow in the UK, the government has expressed 'serious' concerns they could escalate to violence, as witnessed in the US.\n\nToday's encampments have been organised by groups Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine, as well as several other smaller groups.\n\nThe protests had been organised in coalition with each other.\n\nOxford University's Museum of Natural History remained open and apparently untroubled by the 25-strong encampment of tents on its front lawn.\n\nFootage from the protest, posted on X, showed students chanting: 'We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now, now, now.'\n\nUnlike in scenes across the Atlantic, where there were fierce clashes with ranks of guardsmen, students inside Oxford's 'liberated zone' worked on their dissertations on laptops while others gathered around to listen to the first in a series of lectures on the 'history of the Occupation', beginning with the Ottoman period.\n\nIn a printed manifesto, the protestors hit out at the 'infamous' museum beside their protest, in an attempt to stoke wider concerns about imperialism.\n\n'We have established a Liberated Zone on the lawn of the infamous University of Oxford Pitt Rivers Museum. The museum, which 'acquired' items from across the globe through imperial expansionism, mirrors the ongoing struggle of the Palestinian people and connect us to colonised peoples everywhere', it read.\n\n'We invite you to struggle with us. Join us in our library, in our study space, in our peaceful protest, in our call for Oxford to sever its institutional relationships that facilitate the genocide and occupation of the Palestinian people.'\n\nThe rain quickly reduced the well-kempt lawn into a quagmire, while to gain admittance, visitors had to hand over their details, which will be kept 'in accordance with our data security protocols'.\n\nThe paranoid atmosphere was increased by the insistence that all visitors wear a Covid-era mask - whether this was to protect the protestors' health or anonymity was not made clear.\n\nThe obligatory sign-up procedure told visitors: 'The University of Oxford is complicit in the genocide of Palestinians. With strong ties to companies supporting the Zionist entity (like Rolls Royce and Raytheon) and academic ties to Israel, Oxford continues to uphold israel's apartheid regime. The Univeristy's lack of transparency protects its financial interests in the genocide of the Palestinian people. We have had enough.'\n\nMore than 100 dons have backed the encampment. In an open letter, 108 lecturers, faculty members and researchers said they stood 'firmly in support' of the students who had set up the encampment.\n\nOXFORD: Students have erected anti-Israel signs as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza\n\nA spokesperson at Oxford University told MailOnline there is 'no place for intolerance' and the protest must be carried out with 'respect, courtesy and empathy'.\n\nThey added: 'We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests.\n\n'Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the University community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised.\n\n'The Natural History Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum remain open.'\n\nAn Oxford masters student who gave their name only as Wren said: 'We've taken inspiration from students in the USA and also now in the UK as well.\n\n'We're going to be here through all weather and there's going to be loads of us.\n\n'We're going to be here until our demands are met. We're going to be here probably for a while judging by Oxford's inaction so far.'\n\nIn Cambridge a food station, tent to make placards and banners, makeshift toilet were set up in the encampment, which currently holds around 30 tents.\n\nCambridge for Palestine, the group behind the encampment, asked students to join them in solidarity with Palestinians who are being subject to what they claimed is a 'murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing'.\n\nThey claim their institution is 'complicit in genocide' because of its 'financial and academic ties' to a 'settler colonial state'.\n\nCAMBRIDGE: Students gave speeches as they outlined their demands during sit-in protests\n\nCAMBRIDGE: Protesters paint signs as they stage demonstrations on their university lawns, echoing similar encampments seen in the US\n\nIt claimed: 'Cambridge University has over $46 million in defense industry partnerships, contributing to the manufacture of weapons that Israel has used to kill over 40,000 Palestinians, 40 per cent of whom are children, and to destroy every university in Gaza.'\n\nA Cambridge University spokesperson said: 'The University is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest.\n\n'We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy. Our priority is the safety of all staff and students.\n\n'We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.'\n\nThe university protests come on a critical day in the bloody Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nPalestinians began leaving parts of eastern Rafah on Monday after Israel urged 100,000 people to move towards an expanded 'humanitarian zone'.\n\nIt comes ahead of an imminent offensive on the southern Gazan city, where more 1.5 million people have sought shelter.\n\nCeasefire negotiations stalled on Sunday after terror group Hamas said it would turn down any deal that failed to end the war on Palestinian turf.\n\nOXFORD: students have set up a base on the lawn of King's College because the university 'supports Israel 's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'\n\nOXFORD: The growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US\n\nLast week saw students at Russell Group universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle, pitch tents and erect anti-Israel signs as they called for an end to military action in the Gaza strip.\n\nStudents from Manchester University filled nearby Brunswick Park with banners, plaques and Palestinian flags to call for the university to 'end it's partnership with systems which support Israel'.\n\nOne banner read: 'UOM blood on your hands', while another claimed: 'UOM supports Israeli Genocide.'\n\nIn Bristol, hand-painted banners were erected between tents, emblazoned with messages of defiance as students lobbied their university to cut ties with arms companies and back calls for a ceasefire.\n\nIn Newcastle, students were entertained by a Palestinian DJ and treated to regular food supplies, as well as being enticed by free drinks vouchers at the student union bar.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said police will 'have our full support' to tackle potential disorder if students attempt to replicate the violent demonstrations recently seen at US university campuses.\n\nJewish community leaders have urged universities to shut down encampments over fears Jewish students may be 'harassed and excluded'.\n\nJewish students said the protests have made them feel unwelcome on their own campuses, due to the aggressive stance on Israel.\n\nNEWCASTLE: Students say their protest 'highlights the institution's investment strategy and its complicity in the Israeli military's war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank'\n\nMANCHESTER: A protester gives a 'peace' sign at an encampment set up at Brunswick Park\n\nBRISTOL: Fine arts student Sam was taking part at a protest at Bristol University last week\n\nLEEDS: Students manning stalls and camping out at Leeds University last week\n\nNEWCASTLE: Students gathered in front of the university as they protest in solidarity with Gaza on May 1\n\nEdward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), said campus bosses have been 'unwilling' to be 'allies' to his members and are not making them feel 'included'.\n\nLast week he called on vice chancellors to 'muster the moral courage' to 'ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred'.\n\nMr Isaacs said he was aware that students in UK protests are using anti-Israel phrases such as 'globalise the Intifada' and 'do not engage with Zionists'.\n\nHe wrote: 'Encampments are growing and the rhetoric emanating from these encampments is increasing in hostility...\n\n'Universities have been unwilling to effectively stand in allyship with their Jewish students and ensure they can be fully included in campus life.\n\n'Now is a bellwether moment for university administrations as to whether they will muster the moral courage to stand in allyship with Jewish students, and ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred... The moral imperative is theirs.'\n\nMr Isaacs said Jewish students were having to start sitting their end-of-year exams amid 'increased toxicity' towards them.\n\nNEWCASTLE: Hafsa, a 21-year old first year student, joined the encampment at her university\n\nUCL: Pro-Palestine pProtesters outside University College London over the weekend\n\nGOLDSMITHS: A man walks past flags and banners in support of Palestine displayed in the window of his university library\n\nUCL: Students at University College London join pro-Palestinian demonstrations\n\nHe said some protesters were seeking to import 'nefarious' aspects of the violent US demonstrations.\n\n'You may wonder how a few tents can create a hostile environment on campus for Jewish students,' he added.\n\n'But it is what these encampments are trying to emulate which is most disturbing.\n\n'One must only look to the violent scenes at Columbia and UCLA, the brazen support for Hamas, and the all-to-often infiltration of these protests by non-student activists.'\n\nNumber 10 has warned protests should not be used to 'intimidate' others and said police would be 'fully supported' to intervene if any turn violent.\n\nUCLA: Police clash with pro-Palestinian students after destroying part of the encampment barricade at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) early on May 2, 2024\n\nNEW YORK: Police riot gear stormed through the window of a Columbia University building occupied by dozens of pro-Palestine protestors to begin clearing them out\n\nMADISON: Police officers with riot shields go in to break up the encampment at UW-Madison\n\nCHICAGO: Campus police stand between demonstrators at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus of the University of Chicago and counter demonstrators after a brief skirmish between the groups on May 03, 2024\n\nA spokesman for No 10 said: 'We have always been clear that Jewish students must feel safe on campuses and whilst our universities rightfully pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity it is obviously absolutely clear that any antisemitism shouldn't be tolerated.\n\n'We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest but clearly people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption.\n\n'Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed.'\n\nA spokesperson for Universities UK (UUK) said: 'The priority of UUK and our member universities is to ensure that our campuses remain safe for all our students and staff. We will do everything we can to prevent hate crime, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and intolerance, and support our universities to respond appropriately if incidents involving these take place.\n\n'In line with the sector's clear commitment to freedom of speech, it is important that universities enable and support students and staff to debate and discuss this crisis, and the most challenging issues it raises, within the law, and with respect and tolerance.'", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Listen to our latest podcasts to find out What You Need To Know...\n\nThe action follows similar protests at universities in the US, UK and around the world.\n\nAt Columbia University, a leading educational institution in the US, students were arrested as action was shut down by federal police.\n\nSimilar protests have been seen in the UK at universities including Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Warwick and Newcastle.\n\nThis week, student protestors at Goldsmiths, University of London ended their occupation, saying the university had agreed to their demands.\n\nThe protests that have swept across universities in the US have caused controversy, with President Joe Biden criticising the students' protests as becoming \"violent\".\n\nIn a White House address the US president said that while \"dissent is essential for democracy\", it \"must never lead to disorder\".\n\n\"Violent protests are not protected. Peaceful protest is. There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation ... None of this is a peaceful protest.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently said he would back the police and universities in taking action against any protesting students where necessary.\n\nRishi Sunak's official spokesperson said last Thursday: \"While we firmly believe in the power of rigorous free speech and debate, the right to that does not include the right to harass others or incite others to violence or terrorism.\n\n\"Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed,\" they added.\n\n\"We all feel a sense of duty\"\n\nAna, a second year student at the University of Oxford, told ITV News that she has taken part in the encampment to \"stand in solidarity with Palestinian victims of genocide and in solidarity with our friends in Cambridge and on US campuses.\"\n\nShe believes the spread of this kind of protest across the world shows that her generation of students \"refuse to continue as normal and turn a blind eye to slaughter\".\n\n\"We all feel a sense of duty as students in the West, and we plan to be here until the university meets our demands to disclose their investments, divest from the Israeli apartheid government and overhaul future investments,\" she added.\n\nMahmoud, a spokesperson for Cambridge for Palestine who is currently in the encampment, told ITV News that he believes these student movements have the potential to \"start the beginning of the end of Israeli apartheid on Palestinian land.\"\n\nHe said Cambridge students were influenced by other movements.\n\n\"Inspired by South Africa's stand at the ICJ, inspired by students at Columbia University, and by so many universities across the world, we are the latest to join movements pushing forward the idea of Palestinian solidarity outside of Palestine.\"\n\nThe protest has participants from several student and staff groups across the university, including Cambridge Jews for Justice, a group of Jewish students at the University of Cambridge.\n\nHow have the universities responded?\n\nA spokesperson from their group said: \"We refuse to sit by while our university is complicit in, and profits from, the genocide of Palestinians. And we refuse to accept its commitment to murder and bloodshed as the status quo.\n\n\"So, we act together as Jews, religious and secular, in line with our cultural and religious values: demanding disclosure, divestment, reinvestment, and protection - for the university's staff, students, the wider Cambridge community, and for the people of Palestine. Our histories teach us nothing if not the fact that none of us are free until all of us are free.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Cambridge told a student newspaper Varsity: \"The University is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest. We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy. Our priority is the safety of all staff and students. \"We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the University of Oxford said it was \"aware\" of the ongoing demonstrations around the university.\n\n\"We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy.\n\nOxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the University community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised. As we have stressed in our student and staff communications there is no place for intolerance at the University of Oxford.\n\n\"The Museum of Natural History and the Pitt Rivers Museum remain open.\"", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 5,

They are the latest in a global student uprising that is expected to build over the coming week across European campuses after starting at universities in the US, where hundreds of students and staff have been arrested for their involvement.\n\nA joint statement from the organisers Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine read: \"Over 100 universities across the globe have now taken bold and urgent action for Palestine. As members of these institutions, we refuse to accept our universities' complicity in Israel's war crimes against the Palestinian people - and we refuse to stand by while they justify Israel's campaign of mass slaughter, starvation, and displacement.\"\n\nThe protesters at Oxford and Cambridge arrived on Monday morning with supplies, sleeping bags and cardboard signs bearing hand-painted slogans that stated: \"There are no universities left in Gaza\" and \"Divest from genocide\". A large banner, reading \"Welcome to the people's university for Palestine\", was put up outside the encampment in front of the Pitt Rivers museum in Oxford.\n\nThey have also demanded that Oxford and Cambridge universities divest from all companies linked to Israeli genocide and occupation, help rebuild Gaza's education system, end institutional relationships with Israeli universities and protect the safety of students and staff involved in pro-Palestinian action.\n\nMore than 170 Oxford faculty and staff members signed a letter in support of the encampment and its aims.\n\nSneha Krishnan, an associate professor in human geography at the university, said it was \"scandalous\" that universities had not openly condemned Israel's actions. \"I strongly believe that students everywhere in the world are leading us in an important moral struggle at this moment,\" she said.\n\nAna, a second-year undergraduate involved in the encampment at Oxford, said there was an \"optimistic\" atmosphere, with students working on essays alongside attending workshops. \"It's time for more than protests that happen every two weeks,\" she said. \"It's time for us to be here ... in place until the university accepts our demands.\"\n\nA third-year student at Oxford said the encampment would remain for \"as long as it takes\", adding: \"We have no fear of continuing to escalate until these demands are met.\"\n\nAt the encampment on King's Parade, Cambridge, events included deescalation training for protesters, a rally and a dinner funded by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign. A crowdfunding campaign raised nearly \u00a36,000 for the \"vital supplies that will be necessary if our encampment is to be prolonged, persistent, and effective\".\n\nOther universities involved so far include University College London, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield, Leeds, Warwick, Swansea, Goldsmiths and Bristol in the UK; as well as Sciences Po in France, Trinity College Dublin, the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\nA final year student representative of Manchester Camp of Resistancefor Palestine said camps were \"popping up all across the country\", including at Liverpool on Monday, with organisers sharing knowledge and experiences. \"No camps have closed over the past few days,\" she noted.\n\nEarlier in the week, Goldsmiths bowed to pressure from student occupiers and agreed to a new ethical investment policy, including considering switching fund manager; to write to the government urging it to call for a ceasefire; and to fund an undergraduate Palestinian scholarship.\n\nA University of Oxford spokesperson said: \"We respect our students and staff members' right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy.\"\n\nA University of Cambridge spokesperson said: \"The university is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest.

REUTERS/Hollie Adams\n\nBritish students set up pro-Palestinian protest encampments on Oxford and Cambridge universities' historic campuses on a cloudy spring Monday, in a show of solidarity with their American peers.\n\nBy early morning, students had erected dozens of brightly coloured tents on the lawns outside the relatively dull, yellow, 19th-century neo-Gothic Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nStanding in front of the camps, some of which bore the black, white and green Palestinian flag, the students said they were joining 100 universities across the world to protest Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,700 Palestinians so far.\n\nThe footage of protests in Britain was in stark contrast to the jarring scenes from the US over the past couple of weeks, where riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades dispersed and arrested hundreds of protesters.\n\nThere was no visible police presence at the Oxford protest, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene.\n\nThe Columbia University protests in New York, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the U.S. and elsewhere, with students calling for a ceasefire and demanding their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\n\"In terms of why we're doing this style of protest now is that solidarity is so important in every movement,\" 19-year old Rosy Wilson, a student at the University of Oxford, said in an interview.\n\nBy replicating the student protests in America, \"we are showing a united force where we are united with them, we are united with Gaza and we are united with this movement all over the world,\" she added.\n\nAn Oxford University spokesperson said the university, whose many alumni include the likes of Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson and authors Oscar Wilde and J.R.R Tolkien, was aware of the demonstration.\n\n\"We respect our students' and staff members' right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests,\" the spokesperson said. \"We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy...

financial ties with Israel after the country's offensive in Gaza.\n\nIn footage posted to social media, students can be seeing setting up tents and carrying sleeping bags.\n\nIn a joint statement, Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine said they \"refuse to accept our universities' complicity in Israel's war crimes against the Palestinian people\".\n\nThey said: \"Oxbridge's profits cannot continue to climb at the expense of Palestinian lives, and their reputations must no longer be built on the whitewashing of Israeli crimes.\n\n\"Today we join the university students, faculty and staff across the globe who refuse to continue business as usual while our institutions profit from genocide.\"\n\nPro-Palestine encampments have sprung up at UK universities like Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle over the past week, after unrest at similar sites in the US.\n\nCambridge for Palestine called on the university to disclose financial and professional ties to Israel, divest from related organisations, and reinvest in supporting Palestinian students, academics and scholars.\n\nDemands by Oxford Action for Palestine include the university disclosing a comprehensive account of university-wide assets and divesting from \"all companies that are complicit in Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation of Palestine within the next five years\".\n\nStudent-led group Cambridge Jews for Justice in Palestine is supporting the encampment on their university grounds and told the PA news agency: \"We refuse to sit by while our university is complicit in, and profits from, the genocide of Palestinians and we refuse to accept its commitment to murder and bloodshed as the status quo.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said they were joining \"students across the world in refusing the weaponised conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism\".\n\nAn Oxford University spokesperson told PA: \"We respect our students and staff members' right

country, Israel has an inherent right to defend itself.\"\n\nIn response to Monday's demonstrations, the University of Cambridge said it was \"fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law\" and said it acknowledged the \"right to protest\".\n\n\"We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy,\" it said. \"Our priority is the safety of all staff and students.\n\n\"We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.\"\n\nThe wave of university protests in the

Around 60 tents have been erected outside the prestigious college with students demanding an end 'to the genocide' and that Cambridge University divest in any companies linked to Israel. As around 200 protestors held a rally chanting anti-Israel slogans, student Ari Vladimir, 19, unfurled an Israel flag and shouted support for the country. One protestor grabbed the flag from him and threw it to the ground as he was jostled.\n\nMr Vladimir told MailOnline: 'I had to come here to express my support for Israel. If these people have a right to protest then so do I. 'As you saw, I didn't feel particularly welcome. I was pushed and shoved and felt quite scared. 'But I wanted these people to know that the Jewish people will never be defeated and we stand with Israel.' Mr Vladimir is a first year history student at Christ's College who comes from New York. He said that he was alone because many of his fellow Jewish students feel 'intimidated,' and were too scared to join him. He added: 'A lot of Jewish students on campus feel quite scared. They are just keeping their heads down. But I had to take a stand. 'This encampment is going to make Jewish students even more concerned. How would you feel walking past people who are supporting Hamas?'\n\nDuring the rally, protestors shouted: 'Israel is a terror state,' and 'From the river to the sea.' Ari said: 'I think protest is fine, but I just want to say my own peace as well. Their needs to be better organisation because I was pushed, I was grabbed, and I might have just got lucky. ' No police were present at the encampment or rally, something Ari thinks would have 'made him feel safer' and given more protection to counter protestors. Ari added: ' I have to walk through here all the time. I'm still recognisably Jewish and I would not feel safe'. Around 20 people are pitching at the encampment, with teaching staff and PHD students among the cohort of protestors from the University. The string of tents sit on a patch of grass on King's Parade, a central route through the city and a tourist hotspot near King's College.\n\nStudents are being delivered food and have an 'emergency toilet' despite being able to freely walk in and out to their nearby student accommodation. Mahmood, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and an organiser of the Cambridge encampment said: 'It's predominately students but we are supported massively by the community. We've just had a couple from Norwich give us \u00a3500 worth of vouchers to buy food later on.' He said: 'We actually have a surplus of people reaching out to us to be involved'. While it is exam season at the university another protestor, who did not give his name, said that students are 'realising there's a bigger thing going on' and want to take 'action now, not when exams are finished'.\n\nSecurity presence was concentrated on the other side of King's Parade near Senate House, a ceremonial building where students graduate. The building, which has been targeted by Just Stop Oil and has been occupied by other activist groups in recent years, was patrolled by University security guards and three unmarked Metropolitain police cars were stationed outside for a short time- though it is unclear why. At around 8am on Bank Holiday Monday, students pitched tents outside the Pitts Rivers museum in Oxford as they demanded an end to violence in Gaza and the release of hostages. By lunchtime around 70 students have pitched up at the camp. At the same time, Cambridge students armed with tents, gazebos and sleeping bags set up on the front lawn of King's College in protest against ' Israel 's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'.\n\nThe sit-in protests, which echo protests seen in the US, have sprung up at other British universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle over the last week. At Oxford's camp, named the 'liberated zone', students pinned up a board of six demands including calls to boycott Israeli genocide, stop banking with Barclays and help rebuild Gaza's education system. Cambridge for Palestine said it will 'not move' from the encampment until the university agrees to four demands including disclosing financial ties with complicit organisations and protecting students at risk. The protests seek to emulate those seen at American universities in recent weeks, where more than 130 college campuses have been targeted by pro-Palestine supporters.\n\nThese have resulted in growing disorder and unrest, with more than 2,000 arrests. As Gaza protests continue to grow in the UK, the government has expressed 'serious' concerns they could escalate to violence, as witnessed in the US. Today's encampments have been organised by groups Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine, as well as several other smaller groups. The protests had been organised in coalition with each other. Oxford University's Museum of Natural History remained open and apparently untroubled by the 25-strong encampment of tents on its front lawn. Footage from the protest, posted on X, showed students chanting: 'We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now, now, now.'\n\nUnlike in scenes across the Atlantic, where there were fierce clashes with ranks of guardsmen, students inside Oxford's 'liberated zone' worked on their dissertations on laptops while others gathered around to listen to the first in a series of lectures on the 'history of the Occupation', beginning with the Ottoman period. In a printed manifesto, the protestors hit out at the 'infamous' museum beside their protest, in an attempt to stoke wider concerns about imperialism. 'We have established a Liberated Zone on the lawn of the infamous University of Oxford Pitt Rivers Museum. The museum, which 'acquired' items from across the globe through imperial expansionism, mirrors the ongoing struggle of the Palestinian people and connect us to colonised peoples everywhere', it read. 'We invite you to struggle with us. Join us in our library, in our study space, in our peaceful protest, in our call for Oxford to sever its institutional relationships that facilitate the genocide and occupation of the Palestinian people.'\n\nThe rain quickly reduced the well-kempt lawn into a quagmire, while to gain admittance, visitors had to hand over their details, which will be kept 'in accordance with our data security protocols'. The paranoid atmosphere was increased by the insistence that all visitors wear a Covid-era mask - whether this was to protect the protestors' health or anonymity was not made clear. The obligatory sign-up procedure told visitors: 'The University of Oxford is complicit in the genocide of Palestinians. With strong ties to companies supporting the Zionist entity (like Rolls Royce and Raytheon) and academic ties to Israel, Oxford continues to uphold israel's apartheid regime. The Univeristy's lack of transparency protects its financial interests in the genocide of the Palestinian people. We have had enough.'\n\nMore than 100 dons have backed the encampment. In an open letter, 108 lecturers, faculty members and researchers said they stood 'firmly in support' of the students who had set up the encampment. A spokesperson at Oxford University told MailOnline there is 'no place for intolerance' and the protest must be carried out with 'respect, courtesy and empathy'. They added: 'We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests. 'Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the University community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised. 'The Natural History Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum remain open.'\n\nAn Oxford masters student who gave their name only as Wren said: 'We've taken inspiration from students in the USA and also now in the UK as well. 'We're going to be here through all weather and there's going to be loads of us. 'We're going to be here until our demands are met. We're going to be here probably for a while judging by Oxford's inaction so far.' In Cambridge a food station, tent to make placards and banners, makeshift toilet were set up in the encampment, which currently holds around 30 tents. Cambridge for Palestine, the group behind the encampment, asked students to join them in solidarity with Palestinians who are being subject to what they claimed is a 'murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing'.\n\nThey claim their institution is 'complicit in genocide' because of its 'financial and academic ties' to a 'settler colonial state'. It claimed: 'Cambridge University has over $46 million in defense industry partnerships, contributing to the manufacture of weapons that Israel has used to kill over 40,000 Palestinians, 40 per cent of whom are children, and to destroy every university in Gaza.' A Cambridge University spokesperson said: 'The University is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest. 'We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy. Our priority is the safety of all staff and students. 'We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.'\n\nThe university protests come on a critical day in the bloody Israel-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians began leaving parts of eastern Rafah on Monday after Israel urged 100,000 people to move towards an expanded 'humanitarian zone'. It comes ahead of an imminent offensive on the southern Gazan city, where more 1.5 million people have sought shelter. Ceasefire negotiations stalled on Sunday after terror group Hamas said it would turn down any deal that failed to end the war on Palestinian turf. Last week saw students at Russell Group universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle, pitch tents and erect anti-Israel signs as they called for an end to military action in the Gaza strip. Students from Manchester University filled nearby Brunswick Park with banners, plaques and Palestinian flags to call for the university to 'end it's partnership with systems which support Israel'.\n\nJewish students said the protests have made them feel unwelcome on their own campuses, due to the aggressive stance on Israel. Edward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), said campus bosses have been 'unwilling' to be 'allies' to his members and are not making them feel 'included'. Last week he called on vice chancellors to 'muster the moral courage' to 'ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred'. Mr Isaacs said he was aware that students in UK protests are using anti-Israel phrases such as 'globalise the Intifada' and 'do not engage with Zionists'. He wrote: 'Encampments are growing and the rhetoric emanating from these encampments is increasing in hostility... 'Universities have been unwilling to effectively stand in allyship with their Jewish students and ensure they can be fully included in campus life. 'Now is a bellwether moment for university administrations as to whether they will muster the moral courage to stand in allyship with Jewish students, and ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred... The moral imperative is theirs.'\n\nMr Isaacs said Jewish students were having to start sitting their end-of-year exams amid 'increased toxicity' towards them. He said some protesters were seeking to import 'nefarious' aspects of the violent US demonstrations. 'You may wonder how a few tents can create a hostile environment on campus for Jewish students,' he added. 'But it is what these encampments are trying to emulate which is most disturbing. 'One must only look to the violent scenes at Columbia and UCLA, the brazen support for Hamas, and the all-to-often infiltration of these protests by non-student activists.' Number 10 has warned protests should not be used to 'intimidate' others and said police would be 'fully supported' to intervene if any turn violent.\n\nA spokesman for No 10 said: 'We have always been clear that Jewish students must feel safe on campuses and whilst our universities rightfully pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity it is obviously absolutely clear that any antisemitism shouldn't be tolerated. 'We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest but clearly people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption. 'Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed.' A spokesperson for Universities UK (UUK) said: 'The priority of UUK and our member universities is to ensure that our campuses remain safe for all our students and staff. We will do everything we can to prevent hate crime, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and intolerance, and support our universities to respond appropriately if incidents involving these take place. 'In line with the sector's clear commitment to freedom of speech, it is important that universities enable and support students and staff to debate and discuss this crisis, and the most challenging issues it raises, within the law, and with respect and tolerance.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

If these people have a right to protest then so do I.\n\nFootage shows the protest taking place outside Cambridge University's Kings College\n\nThe lone first-year Jewish student is seen displaying an Israeli flag before he is shoved\n\nCAMBRIDGE: Students set up an encampment in solidarity with Gaza this morning\n\n'As you saw, I didn't feel particularly welcome. I was pushed and shoved and felt quite scared.\n\n'But I wanted these people to know that the Jewish people will never be defeated and we stand with Israel.'\n\nMr Vladimir is a first year history student at Christ's College who comes from New York.\n\nHe said that he was alone because many of his fellow Jewish students feel 'intimidated,' and were too scared to join him.\n\nHe added: 'A lot of Jewish students on campus feel quite scared. They are just keeping their heads down. But I had to take a stand.\n\n'This encampment is going to make Jewish students even more concerned. How would you feel walking past people who are supporting Hamas?'\n\nDuring the rally, protestors shouted: 'Israel is a terror state,' and 'From the river to the sea.'\n\nAri said: 'I think protest is fine, but I just want to say my own peace as well. Their needs to be better organisation because I was pushed, I was grabbed, and I might have just got lucky. '\n\nNo police were present at the encampment or rally, something Ari thinks would have 'made him feel safer' and given more protection to counter protestors.\n\nAri added: ' I have to walk through here all the time. I'm still recognisably Jewish and I would not feel safe'.\n\nAround 20 people are pitching at the encampment, with teaching staff and PHD students among the cohort of protestors from the University.\n\nThe string of tents sit on a patch of grass on King's Parade, a central route through the city and a tourist hotspot near King's College.\n\nStudents are being delivered food and have an 'emergency toilet' despite being able to freely walk in and out to their nearby student accommodation.\n\nOXFORD: Students put up a sign listing their six demands at their 'Liberated Zone' camp\n\nOXFORD: They say 'will not rest until their demands are met', with study tents, toilet facilities, and food making areas already in place\n\nMahmood, an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge and an organiser of the Cambridge encampment said: 'It's predominately students but we are supported massively by the community. We've just had a couple from Norwich give us \u00a3500 worth of vouchers to buy food later on.'\n\nHe said: 'We actually have a surplus of people reaching out to us to be involved'.\n\nWhile it is exam season at the university another protestor, who did not give his name, said that students are 'realising there's a bigger thing going on' and want to take 'action now, not when exams are finished'.\n\nSecurity presence was concentrated on the other side of King's Parade near Senate House, a ceremonial building where students graduate.\n\nThe building, which has been targeted by Just Stop Oil and has been occupied by other activist groups in recent years, was patrolled by University security guards and three unmarked Metropolitain police cars were stationed outside for a short time- though it is unclear why.\n\nAt around 8am on Bank Holiday Monday, students pitched tents outside the Pitts Rivers museum in Oxford as they demanded an end to violence in Gaza and the release of hostages. By lunchtime around 70 students have pitched up at the camp.\n\nAt the same time, Cambridge students armed with tents, gazebos and sleeping bags set up on the front lawn of King's College in protest against 'Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'.\n\nThe sit-in protests, which echo protests seen in the US, have sprung up at other British universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle over the last week.\n\nAt Oxford's camp, named the 'liberated zone', students pinned up a board of six demands including calls to boycott Israeli genocide, stop banking with Barclays and help rebuild Gaza's education system.\n\nCambridge for Palestine said it will 'not move' from the encampment until the university agrees to four demands including disclosing financial ties with complicit organisations and protecting students at risk.\n\nThe protests seek to emulate those seen at American universities in recent weeks, where more than 130 college campuses have been targeted by pro-Palestine supporters.\n\nOxford and Cambridge encampments: What are the protesters' demands?\n\nStudents staging encampment protests in solidary with Gaza have put up a lengthy list of demands, and vowed they 'will not move' until these are met.\n\nCambridge for Palestine's four demands are:\n\n1. Disclose: Financial and professional ties with complicit organisations.\n\n2. Divest: Funds and collaborations away from such organisations.\n\n3. Reinvest: In Palestinian students, academics and scholars.\n\n4. Protect: Students at risk, and become a university of sanctuary.\n\nOxford students have pinned up a board with a list of six demands to university bosses. These are:\n\n1. Boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\n\n2. Disclose all finances.\n\n3. Stop banking with Barclays.\n\n4. Help rebuild Gaza's education system.\n\n5. Divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\n\n6. Overhaul the university's investment policy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese have resulted in growing disorder and unrest, with more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nAs Gaza protests continue to grow in the UK, the government has expressed 'serious' concerns they could escalate to violence, as witnessed in the US.\n\nToday's encampments have been organised by groups Oxford Action for Palestine and Cambridge for Palestine, as well as several other smaller groups.\n\nThe protests had been organised in coalition with each other.\n\nOxford University's Museum of Natural History remained open and apparently untroubled by the 25-strong encampment of tents on its front lawn.\n\nFootage from the protest, posted on X, showed students chanting: 'We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now, now, now.'\n\nUnlike in scenes across the Atlantic, where there were fierce clashes with ranks of guardsmen, students inside Oxford's 'liberated zone' worked on their dissertations on laptops while others gathered around to listen to the first in a series of lectures on the 'history of the Occupation', beginning with the Ottoman period.\n\nIn a printed manifesto, the protestors hit out at the 'infamous' museum beside their protest, in an attempt to stoke wider concerns about imperialism.\n\n'We have established a Liberated Zone on the lawn of the infamous University of Oxford Pitt Rivers Museum. The museum, which 'acquired' items from across the globe through imperial expansionism, mirrors the ongoing struggle of the Palestinian people and connect us to colonised peoples everywhere', it read.\n\n'We invite you to struggle with us. Join us in our library, in our study space, in our peaceful protest, in our call for Oxford to sever its institutional relationships that facilitate the genocide and occupation of the Palestinian people.'\n\nThe rain quickly reduced the well-kempt lawn into a quagmire, while to gain admittance, visitors had to hand over their details, which will be kept 'in accordance with our data security protocols'.\n\nThe paranoid atmosphere was increased by the insistence that all visitors wear a Covid-era mask - whether this was to protect the protestors' health or anonymity was not made clear.\n\nThe obligatory sign-up procedure told visitors: 'The University of Oxford is complicit in the genocide of Palestinians. With strong ties to companies supporting the Zionist entity (like Rolls Royce and Raytheon) and academic ties to Israel, Oxford continues to uphold israel's apartheid regime. The Univeristy's lack of transparency protects its financial interests in the genocide of the Palestinian people. We have had enough.'\n\nMore than 100 dons have backed the encampment. In an open letter, 108 lecturers, faculty members and researchers said they stood 'firmly in support' of the students who had set up the encampment.\n\nOXFORD: Students have erected anti-Israel signs as they call for a ceasefire in Gaza\n\nA spokesperson at Oxford University told MailOnline there is 'no place for intolerance' and the protest must be carried out with 'respect, courtesy and empathy'.\n\nREAD MORE: Outrage as pro-Palestine activists stage 'Stop Genocide' protest as thousands of Israelis including Holocaust and October 7 survivors walked to Auschwitz in 'March of the Living' event to honour victims of Nazi WW2 atrocities\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey added: 'We respect our students and staff members right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests.\n\n'Oxford University's primary focus is the health and safety of the University community, and to ensure any impact on work, research and learning, including student exams, is minimised.\n\n'The Natural History Museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum remain open.'\n\nAn Oxford masters student who gave their name only as Wren said: 'We've taken inspiration from students in the USA and also now in the UK as well.\n\n'We're going to be here through all weather and there's going to be loads of us.\n\n'We're going to be here until our demands are met. We're going to be here probably for a while judging by Oxford's inaction so far.'\n\nIn Cambridge a food station, tent to make placards and banners, makeshift toilet were set up in the encampment, which currently holds around 30 tents.\n\nCambridge for Palestine, the group behind the encampment, asked students to join them in solidarity with Palestinians who are being subject to what they claimed is a 'murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing'.\n\nThey claim their institution is 'complicit in genocide' because of its 'financial and academic ties' to a 'settler colonial state'.\n\nCAMBRIDGE: Students gave speeches as they outlined their demands during sit-in protests\n\nCAMBRIDGE: Protesters paint signs as they stage demonstrations on their university lawns, echoing similar encampments seen in the US\n\nREAD MORE: DJ sets, free drink tokens and trips home for showers: Inside Britain universities' Gaza sit-ins as students complain it's cold and they're not 'champagne socialists' at 'solidarity' encampments\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt claimed: 'Cambridge University has over $46 million in defense industry partnerships, contributing to the manufacture of weapons that Israel has used to kill over 40,000 Palestinians, 40 per cent of whom are children, and to destroy every university in Gaza.'\n\nA Cambridge University spokesperson said: 'The University is fully committed to academic freedom and freedom of speech within the law and we acknowledge the right to protest.\n\n'We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy. Our priority is the safety of all staff and students.\n\n'We will not tolerate antisemitism, Islamophobia and any other form of racial or religious hatred, or other unlawful activity.'\n\nThe university protests come on a critical day in the bloody Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nPalestinians began leaving parts of eastern Rafah on Monday after Israel urged 100,000 people to move towards an expanded 'humanitarian zone'.\n\nIt comes ahead of an imminent offensive on the southern Gazan city, where more 1.5 million people have sought shelter.\n\nCeasefire negotiations stalled on Sunday after terror group Hamas said it would turn down any deal that failed to end the war on Palestinian turf.\n\nOXFORD: students have set up a base on the lawn of King's College because the university 'supports Israel 's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza'\n\nOXFORD: The growing number of demonstrations have led to 'serious' government concerns that the campus protests could escalate to violence as witnessed in the US\n\nLast week saw students at Russell Group universities including Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Sheffield and Newcastle, pitch tents and erect anti-Israel signs as they called for an end to military action in the Gaza strip.\n\nREAD MORE: Universities accused of abandoning Jewish students after 'increasingly hostile rhetoric emanating from encampments in solidarity with Gaza'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudents from Manchester University filled nearby Brunswick Park with banners, plaques and Palestinian flags to call for the university to 'end it's partnership with systems which support Israel'.\n\nOne banner read: 'UOM blood on your hands', while another claimed: 'UOM supports Israeli Genocide.'\n\nIn Bristol, hand-painted banners were erected between tents, emblazoned with messages of defiance as students lobbied their university to cut ties with arms companies and back calls for a ceasefire.\n\nIn Newcastle, students were entertained by a Palestinian DJ and treated to regular food supplies, as well as being enticed by free drinks vouchers at the student union bar.\n\nThe Prime Minister's official spokesman said police will 'have our full support' to tackle potential disorder if students attempt to replicate the violent demonstrations recently seen at US university campuses.\n\nJewish community leaders have urged universities to shut down encampments over fears Jewish students may be 'harassed and excluded'.\n\nJewish students said the protests have made them feel unwelcome on their own campuses, due to the aggressive stance on Israel.\n\nNEWCASTLE: Students say their protest 'highlights the institution's investment strategy and its complicity in the Israeli military's war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank'\n\nMANCHESTER: A protester gives a 'peace' sign at an encampment set up at Brunswick Park\n\nBRISTOL: Fine arts student Sam was taking part at a protest at Bristol University last week\n\nLEEDS: Students manning stalls and camping out at Leeds University last week\n\nNEWCASTLE: Students gathered in front of the university as they protest in solidarity with Gaza on May 1\n\nEdward Isaacs, president of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), said campus bosses have been 'unwilling' to be 'allies' to his members and are not making them feel 'included'.\n\nLast week he called on vice chancellors to 'muster the moral courage' to 'ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred'.\n\nMr Isaacs said he was aware that students in UK protests are using anti-Israel phrases such as 'globalise the Intifada' and 'do not engage with Zionists'.\n\nHe wrote: 'Encampments are growing and the rhetoric emanating from these encampments is increasing in hostility...\n\n'Universities have been unwilling to effectively stand in allyship with their Jewish students and ensure they can be fully included in campus life.\n\n'Now is a bellwether moment for university administrations as to whether they will muster the moral courage to stand in allyship with Jewish students, and ensure campuses are places where they can study free from hatred... The moral imperative is theirs.'\n\nMr Isaacs said Jewish students were having to start sitting their end-of-year exams amid 'increased toxicity' towards them.\n\nNEWCASTLE: Hafsa, a 21-year old first year student, joined the encampment at her university\n\nUCL: Pro-Palestine pProtesters outside University College London over the weekend\n\nGOLDSMITHS: A man walks past flags and banners in support of Palestine displayed in the window of his university library\n\nUCL: Students at University College London join pro-Palestinian demonstrations\n\nHe said some protesters were seeking to import 'nefarious' aspects of the violent US demonstrations.\n\n'You may wonder how a few tents can create a hostile environment on campus for Jewish students,' he added.\n\n'But it is what these encampments are trying to emulate which is most disturbing.\n\n'One must only look to the violent scenes at Columbia and UCLA, the brazen support for Hamas, and the all-to-often infiltration of these protests by non-student activists.'\n\nNumber 10 has warned protests should not be used to 'intimidate' others and said police would be 'fully supported' to intervene if any turn violent.\n\nUCLA: Police clash with pro-Palestinian students after destroying part of the encampment barricade at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) early on May 2, 2024\n\nNEW YORK: Police riot gear stormed through the window of a Columbia University building occupied by dozens of pro-Palestine protestors to begin clearing them out\n\nMADISON: Police officers with riot shields go in to break up the encampment at UW-Madison\n\nCHICAGO: Campus police stand between demonstrators at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus of the University of Chicago and counter demonstrators after a brief skirmish between the groups on May 03, 2024\n\nA spokesman for No 10 said: 'We have always been clear that Jewish students must feel safe on campuses and whilst our universities rightfully pride themselves on their openness and tolerance and diversity it is obviously absolutely clear that any antisemitism shouldn't be tolerated.\n\n'We've always been clear that people have a right to peaceful and lawful protest but clearly people shouldn't abuse that right to intimidate others, cause unnecessary disruption.\n\n'Obviously the police already have extensive public order powers to tackle disorder at protests and will continue to have our full support in doing so if needed.'\n\nA spokesperson for Universities UK (UUK) said: 'The priority of UUK and our member universities is to ensure that our campuses remain safe for all our students and staff. We will do everything we can to prevent hate crime, antisemitism, Islamophobia, and intolerance, and support our universities to respond appropriately if incidents involving these take place.\n\n'In line with the sector's clear commitment to freedom of speech, it is important that universities enable and support students and staff to debate and discuss this crisis, and the most challenging issues it raises, within the law, and with respect and tolerance.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He is expected to tell them that a \"vocal and aggressive minority\" must not be allowed to intimidate other students and academics.\n\nMs Keegan writes: \"The sad fact is since the abhorrent 7 October [Hamas] attacks, there has been an unprecedented rise in incidents of anti-Semitic abuse and intimidation.\n\n\"This is creating a hostile and toxic atmosphere on campus, which these protests will add to, when students are beginning some of the most important exams of their lives.\n\n\"In light of this, I am making myself very clear: anti-Semitic abuse and intimidation must not be tolerated on university campuses and we will not stand by as Jewish students suffer.\n\n\"Freedom of speech and expression is vital to academic communities, but it must not be used to harass and intimidate, or cause significant disruption to the vital business of higher education.\"\n\nThe Oxford and Cambridge protests began shortly after 8am yesterday, when demonstrators carrying sleeping bags, tents, and supplies began setting up camps.\n\nIn Oxford, activists targeted the Pitt Rivers Museum, declaring the grounds outside the building a \"Liberated Zone\".\n\nSimultaneously, in Cambridge, students carrying the same assortment of camping supplies and banners, occupied the lawn outside King's College.\n\nOn social media, the two groups proclaimed that they were carrying out a \"coordinated protest\" after being inspired by similar events in the US.\n\nIn Oxford, protesters named their makeshift camp after the now infamous set up at Columbia University in the US which was stormed by riot police.\n\nThousands of students across America's east and west coasts have brought their institutions to a standstill with the demonstrations, which at times have escalated into violent clashes with hundreds of arrests.\n\nIn a post explaining why they had targeted Oxbridge, the two groups claimed that \"they lend financial and moral support to Israel's genocide, occupation and ethnic cleansing of Palestine\".\n\nThe camp protest in Oxford was supported by more than 100 academics who wrote an open letter stating they \"stood firmly in support of the members of the university community who have begun an encampment outside the Pitt Rivers Museum\".\n\nThe lecturers demanded that Oxford's vice-chancellor \"unequivocally condemn\" the killing of university professors in Gaza and Israel's bombardment of its education system.\n\nMany of the protesters were masked and refused to reveal their identities, however among them was Rosy Wilson, an activist who previously heckled Nancy Pelosi, the former US Speaker, and confronted Anneliese Dodds, the Labour MP for Oxford East, over her stance on oil and gas licences.\n\nIn Cambridge, Harvey Brown, a student welfare officer who previously \"liked\" a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, that supported the Oct 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, was spotted at the camp.\n\nChants of \"From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free\" were heard at both events with activists leading the calls through a megaphone.\n\nThe police presence at both events was minimal and both universities issued statements saying they respected the right to free speech and to protest but would not tolerate anti-Semitism.\n\nWhile the events were mostly peaceful, an American Jewish student who walked past the Cambridge camp said he was pushed by protesters before having an Israeli flag torn from his hand.\n\nJewish societies at both universities issued statements saying the creation of the camps left students feeling \"on edge\", adding that \"University inaction only serves to alienate Jewish students from campus\"\n\nMeanwhile in London, students set up a pro-Palestinian camp at SOAS University. SOAS is the second university in the capital to set up a camp behind University College London, where pro-Palestinian protesters allegedly spat at a group of counter-protesters on Sunday and told them to \"go back to Poland\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type":

REUTERS/Hollie Adams\n\nBy Hollie Adams\n\nOXFORD (Reuters) - British students set up pro-Palestinian protest encampments on Oxford and Cambridge universities' historic campuses on a cloudy spring Monday, in a show of solidarity with their American peers.\n\nBy early morning, students had erected dozens of brightly coloured tents on the lawns outside the relatively dull, yellow, 19th-century neo-Gothic Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nStanding in front of the camps, some of which bore the black, white and green Palestinian flag, the students said they were joining 100 universities across the world to protest Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,700 Palestinians so far.\n\nThe footage of protests in Britain was in stark contrast to the jarring scenes from the U.S. over the past couple of weeks, where riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades dispersed and arrested hundreds of protesters.\n\nThere was no visible police presence at the Oxford protest, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene.\n\nThe Columbia University protests in New York, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the U.S. and elsewhere, with students calling for a ceasefire and demanding their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\n\"In terms of why we're doing this style of protest now is that solidarity is so important in every movement,\" 19-year old Rosy Wilson, a student at the University of Oxford, said in an interview.\n\nBy replicating the student protests in America, \"we are showing a united force where we are united with them, we are united with Gaza and we are united with this movement all over the world,\" she added.\n\nAn Oxford University spokesperson said the university, whose many alumni include the likes of Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson and authors Oscar Wilde and J.R.R Tolkien, was aware of the demonstration.\n\n\"We respect our students' and staff members' right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests,\" the spokesperson said. \"We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy... There is no place for intolerance at the University of Oxford.\"\n\n(Reporting by Hollie Adams; writing by Muvija M; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Just as we are focused on making our graduation experience truly special, we continue to solicit student feedback and are looking at the possibility of a festive event on May 15 to take the place of the large, formal ceremony,\" the university said in a statement. \"We are eager to all come together for our graduates and celebrate our fellow Columbians as they, and we, look ahead to the future. We will share more in the coming days.\"\n\nColumbia, the epicenter of pro-Palestinian campus protests, is at least the second school to cancel its main graduation ceremony. The University of Southern California canceled its main commencement on April 25th after police broke up an encampment and caused campus shutdown.\n\nAs the demonstrations continue, so does the war in Gaza. On Monday, the Israeli military began warning Palestinians to leave Rafah, a densely crowded city in southern Gaza where Israel has long said it will launch an offensive, even as the Biden administration and the international community has urged against it.\n\nMore: A Columbia professor wanted to document history. NYPD arrested him outside his home\n\nOverseas, pro-Palestinian encampments were erected on the campuses of Oxford and Cambridge on Monday as students and organizers call on the universities to sever financial ties to Israel.\n\nOxford Action For Palestine, the organizing group leading the demonstration at Oxford, said in a statement that an encampment was established at 4 a.m. on the lawn outside of Pitts River Museum on the university's campus. The group's demands include that Oxford disclose its investments, land holdings and grants; divest from all \"arms companies\"; divest from all companies involved in the war in Gaza; and end its relationships with universities in Israel.\n\nAt Cambridge, students set up tents and banners outside King's College on Monday. Cambridge for Palestine, the organizers leading the protest, called on the university to divest from Israel and demanded a meeting with the school's leadership.\n\nStudents at Princeton University began a hunger strike in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, calling for the Ivy League school to divest from Israel.\n\n\"Participants will abstain from all food and drink (except water) until our demands are met,\" said a statement from organizers. \"We commit our bodies to [the] liberation of Palestine. PRINCETON, hear us now! We will not be moved!\"\n\nThe university told CNN that university physicians were monitoring the group and were offering the students health information and medical support.

They were joined by numerous members of staff at the university's colleges.\n\nIn coordination with the organisers at Cambridge, students from Oxford University pitched up tents outside the Pitt Rivers Museum, which they claimed holds a disturbing hoard of artefacts stolen from colonised peoples across the world.\n\nCambridge for Palestine posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, of dozens of pro-Palestine protesters marching onto the famous lawn with tents, supplies and sleeping bags, saying they refuse to sit idly by while the university \"supports Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza\".\n\nEarlier this year, MEE reported that Trinity, Cambridge's wealthiest college, had \u00a361,735 ($78,089) invested in Israel's largest arms company, Elbit Systems, which produces 85 percent of the drones and land-based equipment used by the Israeli army.\n\nJapanese trading giant Itochu cut ties with Elbit in February in response to an ICJ ruling that Israel may be committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nAccording to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the college also has investments worth approximately $3.2m (\u00a32.5m) in Caterpillar, a US-based heavy equipment company that has long been the target of boycott campaigns for its sale of bulldozers to the Israeli army, and multiple other companies involved in Israel's war - including General Electric, Toyota Corporation, Rolls-Royce, Barclays Bank, and L3Harris Industries.\n\nAt Cambridge, the protest's organisers told MEE they are demanding that Cambridge University discloses all its relationships with companies and institutions \"complicit in the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestine\".\n\nThey said they want the university to end all such relationships, support Palestinian students and academics - and commit to protecting academic freedom.\n\nMEE spoke to a masked staff member at Trinity College who was attending the protest and asked to remain anonymous. \"Most staff members here are trying to be fully covered,\" she said, referencing other protestors. \"There's a fear of action against staff members.\n\n'Our attention should be on Gaza, where thousands have been brutally murdered... it's frankly disgusting that the university is complicit'\n\n- student protester, Cambridge\n\n\"I don't know if I'd say there's censorship or fear but you want to protect your income.\"\n\nMEE saw Kamal Munir and Bhaskar Vira, two of Cambridge's pro-vice-chancellors, senior administrators, walking around the encampment and talking to protestors. They told MEE they did not yet have a comment for the press.\n\nMost protestors were masked and asked to remain anonymous.\n\nOne student told MEE that he was prepared to remain in the encampment until the movement's demands were met, adding that \"our attention should be on Gaza, where thousands have been brutally murdered... it's frankly disgusting that the university is complicit.\"\n\nHe rejected the idea that the protest was divisive or extremist: \"We're just camping. What's extreme is bombing kids and occupying land for decades on end.\"\n\nAnother student said he believed there is widespread public support for such protests, noting that according to opinion polls the British public overwhelmingly back a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"Every once in a while someone from the public comes and chants with us,\" he said.\n\nA group called Cambridge Jews for Palestine formed a prominent part of the encampment. \"There are many of us Jews who believe it is our duty to speak out,\" one of its members told MEE.\n\nIn an official statement to the press, the group said: \"We refuse to sit by while our university is complicit in, and profits from, the genocide of Palestinians.\"\n\nAt Oxford, the student protesters erected a board with a list of six demands to university administrators, including a pledge to \"boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation,\" to \"disclose all finances,\" \"stop banking with Barclays\", help rebuild Gaza's education system and \"divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\"\n\n\"There is no university in the history of human civilisation that is more complicit in violence, dispossession, and the building of destructive colonial empires than the University of Oxford,\" they added in a statement.\n\nIn a video published on X, a grouop of protesters at Oxford could be heard chanting: \"We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now now now.\"\n\nSince the start of the war on Gaza, Cambridge has been griupped by protests over its potential complicity in possible Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nIn March, an activist from Palestine Action spray-painted then slashed a 1914 painting of Lord Arthur Balfour at Trinity.\n\nBalfour was Britain's foreign secretary in 1917 when he issued the Balfour Declaration - a statement of intent by the British government to support the establishment \"in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".\n\nAnd in February, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians issued a legal notice to Trinity warning that its investments could make it potentially complicit in Israeli war crimes.\n\nIn recent weeks, students at several UK universities, including UCL, the University of Manchester and the University of Warwick, have launched tent encampments to demand divestment from Israel.\n\nThe encampments come after violent crackdowns on pro-Palestine solidarity at campuses across the US.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds of riot police descended on a pro-Palestine encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, and arrested hundreds of protestors, days after the protest site was attacked by Israel supporters.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, New York City police arrested dozens of students holed up in an academic building at Columbia University and removed a protest encampment the Ivy League school had sought to dismantle for nearly two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle

They were joined by numerous members of staff at the university's colleges.\n\nIn coordination with the organisers at Cambridge, students from Oxford University pitched up tents outside the Pitt Rivers Museum, which they claimed holds a disturbing hoard of artefacts stolen from colonised peoples across the world.\n\nCambridge for Palestine posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, of dozens of pro-Palestine protesters marching onto the famous lawn with tents, supplies and sleeping bags, saying they refuse to sit idly by while the university \"supports Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza\".\n\nEarlier this year, MEE reported that Trinity, Cambridge's wealthiest college, had \u00a361,735 ($78,089) invested in Israel's largest arms company, Elbit Systems, which produces 85 percent of the drones and land-based equipment used by the Israeli army.\n\nJapanese trading giant Itochu cut ties with Elbit in February in response to an ICJ ruling that Israel may be committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nAccording to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the college also has investments worth approximately $3.2m (\u00a32.5m) in Caterpillar, a US-based heavy equipment company that has long been the target of boycott campaigns for its sale of bulldozers to the Israeli army, and multiple other companies involved in Israel's war - including General Electric, Toyota Corporation, Rolls-Royce, Barclays Bank, and L3Harris Industries.\n\nAt Cambridge, the protest's organisers told MEE they are demanding that Cambridge University discloses all its relationships with companies and institutions \"complicit in the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestine\".\n\nThey said they want the university to end all such relationships, support Palestinian students and academics - and commit to protecting academic freedom.\n\nMEE spoke to a masked staff member at Trinity College who was attending the protest and asked to remain anonymous. \"Most staff members here are trying to be fully covered,\" she said, referencing other protestors. \"There's a fear of action against staff members.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd say there's censorship or fear but you want to protect your income.\"\n\nMEE saw Kamal Munir and Bhaskar Vira, two of Cambridge's pro-vice-chancellors, senior administrators, walking around the encampment and talking to protestors. They told MEE they did not yet have a comment for the press.\n\nMost protestors were masked and asked to remain anonymous.\n\nOne student told MEE that he was prepared to remain in the encampment until the movement's demands were met, adding that \"our attention should be on Gaza, where thousands have been brutally murdered... it's frankly disgusting that the university is complicit.\"\n\nHe rejected the idea that the protest was divisive or extremist: \"We're just camping. What's extreme is bombing kids and occupying land for decades on end.\"\n\nAnother student said he believed there is widespread public support for such protests, noting that according to opinion polls the British public overwhelmingly back a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\n\"Every once in a while someone from the public comes and chants with us,\" he said.\n\nNot all passersbys were supportive. \"They need to be locked up,\" one man said, as protestors chanted \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\" Another passerby agreed with him: \"They're ruining this country.\"\n\nA group called Cambridge Jews for Palestine formed a prominent part of the encampment. \"There are many of us Jews who believe it is our duty to speak out,\" one of its members told MEE.\n\nIn an official statement to the press, the group said: \"We refuse to sit by while our university is complicit in, and profits from, the genocide of Palestinians.\"\n\nAt Oxford, the student protesters erected a board with a list of six demands to university administrators, including a pledge to \"boycott Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation,\" to \"disclose all finances,\" \"stop banking with Barclays\", help rebuild Gaza's education system and \"divest from Israeli genocide, apartheid and occupation.\"\n\n\"There is no university in the history of human civilisation that is more complicit in violence, dispossession, and the building of destructive colonial empires than the University of Oxford,\" they added in a statement.\n\nIn a video published on X, a grouop of protesters at Oxford could be heard chanting: \"We are the people. We will not be silenced. Stop the bombing now now now.\"\n\nSince the start of the war on Gaza, Cambridge has been griupped by protests over its potential complicity in possible Israeli war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nIn March, an activist from Palestine Action spray-painted then slashed a 1914 painting of Lord Arthur Balfour at Trinity.\n\nBalfour was Britain's foreign secretary in 1917 when he issued the Balfour Declaration - a statement of intent by the British government to support the establishment \"in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".\n\nAnd in February, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians issued a legal notice to Trinity warning that its investments could make it potentially complicit in Israeli war crimes.\n\nIn recent weeks, students at several UK universities, including UCL, the University of Manchester and the University of Warwick, have launched tent encampments to demand divestment from Israel.\n\nThe encampments come after violent crackdowns on pro-Palestine solidarity at campuses across the US.\n\nOn Thursday, hundreds of riot police descended on a pro-Palestine encampment at the University of California, Los Angeles, and arrested hundreds of protestors, days after the protest site was attacked by Israel supporters.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, New York City police arrested dozens of students holed up in an academic building at Columbia University and removed a protest encampment the Ivy League school had sought to dismantle for nearly two weeks.", "source": {"uri": "defenddemocracy.press", "dataType": "news", "title":

An Oxford University spokesperson said the university, whose many alumni include the likes of Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson and authors Oscar Wilde and J.R.R Tolkien, was aware of the demonstration.\n\nBritish students set up pro-Palestinian protest encampments on Oxford and Cambridge universities' historic campuses on a cloudy spring Monday, in a show of solidarity with their American peers. By early morning, students had erected dozens of brightly coloured tents on the lawns outside the relatively dull, yellow, 19th-century neo-Gothic Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\nStanding in front of the camps, some of which bore the black, white and green Palestinian flag, the students said they were joining 100 universities across the world to protest Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,700 Palestinians so far. The footage of protests in Britain was in stark contrast to the jarring scenes from the U.S. over the past couple of weeks, where riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades dispersed and arrested hundreds of protesters.\n\nThere was no visible police presence at the Oxford protest, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene. The Columbia University protests in New York, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the U.S. and elsewhere, with students calling for a ceasefire and demanding their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\n\"In terms of why we're doing this style of protest now is that solidarity is so important in every movement,\" 19-year old Rosy Wilson, a student at the University of Oxford, said in an interview. By replicating the student protests in America, \"we are showing a united force where we are united with them, we are united with Gaza and we are united with this movement all over the world,\" she added.\n\nAn Oxford University spokesperson said the university, whose many alumni include the likes of Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson and authors Oscar Wilde and J.R.R Tolkien, was aware of the demonstration. \"We respect our students' and staff members' right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests,\" the spokesperson said. \"We ask everyone who is taking part to do so with respect, courtesy and empathy...

Just Stop Oil, she is seen holding a Palestinian flag, and shouting: \"Labour is supposed to be the party of the people and yet it refuses to stand up for human lives.\n\n\"We know that all genocide is interlinked, we know that all human suffering is interlinked and we have to stand up against it.\"\n\nMs Wilson, who is studying philosophy, politics and economics, was pictured at the camp protest on Monday, despite her fellow activists denying she was in attendance.\n\nFace masks\n\nAt the encampment in Cambridge, Harvey Brown, Cambridge Students' Union's welfare officer, was spotted wearing a floral top and a face mask.\n\nMr Brown was seen coming and going throughout the afternoon and, on Monday evening, The Telegraph saw him climb into a tent with a large bag, which appeared to suggest he may stay overnight.\n\nHe came under fire in October when The Telegraph revealed that he had liked a series of posts on X, formerly Twitter, that supported the Oct 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nOne such post heralded \"a day of celebration\" as \"Hamas fighters cross into their colonisers' territory\".\n\nAfter an outcry from Jewish students, Mr Brown apologised for his \"rash\" actions.\n\nWhile he is not thought to be among the lead organisers of the Cambridge camp, he answered \"no comment\" when The Telegraph approached him on Monday afternoon to ask about his involvement.\n\nRingleaders remain anonymous\n\nNone of the ringleaders of the protests, either in Oxford or in Cambridge, wanted to be named and the majority were wearing masks, or keffiyehs, a scarf symbolic of Palestinian nationalism.\n\nOne woman, who led chants with a microphone in Oxford, was approached by the Telegraph but she refused to give her name or explain why she had decided to protest.\n\nAnother Oxford protester, who was willing to talk, albeit anonymously, said they had been inspired to set up camp at the university after seeing similar protests in the US.\n\nThe woman, a PhD student, said: \"We're here with these demands, and we're not planning to leave until the demands are met.\n\n\"We're taking a lot of inspiration from the international movement in the US.\"\n\nCampus demonstrations across America descended into violence last last month as riot police forcibly shut down encampments at several universities.\n\nThe demonstrations began in the US earlier this year to protest against Israel's offensive in Gaza, which followed Hamas launching its deadly attack on Israel.\n\n'Global chain reaction'\n\nKendall Gardner, a Jewish-American PhD politics student, was one of a small number of protesters in Oxford willing to be named.\n\n\"The one aim of the protest that comes to mind first, is following this global chain of reaction that Columbia started and showing solidarity with them,\" Ms Gardner said.\n\nAsked why they had targeted the Pitt Rivers museum, she said: \"This museum has not returned the artefacts that were taken and pillaged during extraordinarily violent times of the British Empire.\n\n\"We are trying to call attention to the role that this university has played in the ongoing colonisation of many places around the world, including Palestine.\"\n\nShe added: \"As a Jewish person, it means a lot to me to be able to stand in solidarity with the Palestinian people and carry on these legacies of resistance that honestly connect us more than divide us.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_bolton@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Will

Standing in front of the camps, some of which bore the black, white and green Palestinian flag, the students said they were joining 100 universities across the world to protest Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 34,700 Palestinians so far.\n\nThe footage of protests in Britain was in stark contrast to the jarring scenes from the U.S. over the past couple of weeks, where riot police wielding batons and flash-bang grenades dispersed and arrested hundreds of protesters. There was no visible police presence at the Oxford protest, according to a Reuters photographer at the scene.\n\nThe Columbia University protests in New York, which drew national attention, have inspired similar demonstrations at dozens of universities around the U.S. and elsewhere, with students calling for a ceasefire and demanding their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel. \"In terms of why we're doing this style of protest now is that solidarity is so important in every movement,\" 19-year old Rosy Wilson, a student at the University of Oxford, said in an interview.\n\nBy replicating the student protests in America, \"we are showing a united force where we are united with them, we are united with Gaza and we are united with this movement all over the world,\" she added.

Students began setting up shanty camps on the lawns of their colleges yesterday, emulating the widespread protests taking place at American universities. There, the police were called in to end an occupation at Columbia in New York. Here, academic authorities will face a headache if the action expands at a time when many students are about to sit their final exams.\n\nAn encampment outside Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum was partly organised because the building displays \"a disturbing hoard of artefacts stolen from colonised peoples across the world\". The demonstrators said in a statement: \"There is no university in the history of human civilisation that is more complicit in violence, dispossession, and the building of destructive colonial empires than the University of Oxford.\" If they think that, why did they go there?\n\nOn the lawn of King's College, Cambridge, students said their protest was because the university \"supports Israel's genocide of Palestinians in Gaza\". Many sported the keffiyeh headdress worn by Palestinians in a show of solidarity, thereby engaging in the \"cultural appropriation\" they normally oppose.\n\nThere is a long tradition of student agitation down the years for a variety of causes. In 1968, the London School of Economics was occupied in a demonstration against the Vietnam War and the following decade saw a rash of occupations and rent strikes. But the latest wave sweeping the US, and possibly now Britain, owes more to the culture wars inspired by hatred of the West being waged by the very people who have benefited most from its freedoms and prosperity. Today's protesters are allied to illiberal, authoritarian and repressive regimes against the one democracy in the region. They wave banners in support of a terror group that murdered more than 1,000 Israelis last October and took hundreds of hostages, many of whom are now dead.\n\nThey are not alone in fearing the worst for civilians in Gaza if the Israeli Defence Force attacks Rafah. Benjamin Netanyahu is facing opposition both at home and internationally to another assault. But the students' one-sided approach and failure to condemn Hamas and its refusal to release the hostages, places them in a compromised position.

\"terrifying to me\".\n\nFirst-year Land Economy student Raphael, 25, said the slogan \"means death to me and all my family\".\n\nThe 40-tent encampment pitched outside elite King's College, Cambridge -- which has nurtured eight Nobel prize winners -- is part of a wave of campus protests across Britain.\n\nStarted in the US, the pro-Palestine demos have spread to Cambridge's gilded twin Oxford, as well as Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Newcastle and Edinburgh.\n\nThe move has led to Jewish students saying they face a \"hostile and toxic atmosphere\" on campuses.\n\nThis week I witnessed a Jewish student wearing a kippah, or skull cap, being turned away from a protest camp pitched outside Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum.\n\nTheir faces obscured by medical masks and Middle Eastern keffiyeh scarves -- a symbol of Palestinian nationalism -- protestors insist those entering the camp sign up to their radical manifesto.\n\nIt includes a demand that millions of Palestinians be allowed to take back what they claim is their ancestral land in Israel, effectively meaning the country's collapse.\n\nAnd the manifesto talks of the \"right of colonised people to resist against occupation\".\n\nGolden tickets\n\nThe Jewish student, who declined to give his name \"for my own safety\", said: \"I wanted to wear my kippah to show there is another viewpoint.\n\n\"I wanted to wear an Israeli flag armband but changed my mind.\n\n\"I don't want to end up in the hospital.\"\n\nIn his 30s and studying for a PhD in Computer Science, he said of the protest: \"I hope it stops in this beautiful city.\n\n\"I hope they don't use it to \u00adintimidate Jewish students\".\n\nYesterday in Downing Street, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held a meeting with 17 university vice chancellors, urging them to take a \"zero-tolerance\" approach to anti-Semitism.\n\nLast year there were 182 university-related anti-Semitic incidents recorded by the Community Security Trust -- a rise of 203 per cent on 2022.\n\nSunak said that \"universities have a profound duty to remain bastions of tolerance\".\n\nTwo of the most prominent campus protests are in Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nPlaces at these universities are golden tickets in the lottery of life.\n\nMany graduates will secure lucrative roles in the City, civil service, the arts and top \"magic circle\" law firms.\n\nWhat happens at these elite crucibles of learning matters to the rest of us.\n\nOf Britain's 57 Prime Ministers, 44 attended Oxford or Cambridge.\n\nIn Oxford -- the oldest university in the English-speaking world, dating from 1096 -- students have pitched 30-odd tents on a patch of lawn.\n\nThey chose the site outside the Pitt Rivers Museum, claiming items in its collection were acquired \"through imperial expansionism\" and that \"cultural pillaging\" defines \"Oxford's legacy\".\n\nVisitors to the encampment are greeted with \"Welcome to the People's University for Palestine\" daubed on a white bedsheet.\n\nOther banners accuse Israel of \"genocide\", \"apartheid\" with another stating \"Divest from death\".\n\nStudents draped in their black and white keffiyehs sat in a circle intently listening to a speaker.\n\nSessions this week have included a \"liberation fellowship teach-in\" and \"physical wellness\".\n\nOne of the leading protesters is 26-year-old Kendall Gardner, who made headlines this week when \u00adfootage emerged of her peeling off a black university gown to reveal a bikini underneath.\n\nThe American, who is a politics student, said the video she posted on Twitter/X last year was an audition for Love Island.\n\nPosing in college grounds, she said on the social media post that it was \"time to put down the books and pick up the boys\".\n\nMy efforts to speak to Kendall and other Palestine campaigners here were rebuffed this week.\n\nEntering the encampment, I was directed to a media tent where a \u00adrepresentative for Oxford Action for Palestine politely said no one at the camp would talk to me.\n\nOther protestors at the site weren't so courteous.\n\nA man saying he was a \"trade unionist\" raised his middle \u00adfinger at me while a woman with dyed-red hair screamed \"scum\".\n\nIt was nothing personal.\n\nOther \u00adnational newspaper reporters were \u00adfollowed around the site before being pressured to leave.\n\nA journalist from the Daily Telegraph, who initially refused, was surrounded by an \"intimidating mob\" who \"shouted in his face\" before he exited.\n\nHowever, Iranian State-owned Press TV -- banned from broadcasting in the UK by watchdog Ofcom -- were granted an interview.\n\nThe station -- which can still broadcast online -- once carried a piece on its website from holocaust denier Nicolas Kollerstrom arguing that \"the alleged massacre of Jewish people by gassing during World War Two was scientifically impossible\".\n\nYet, a number of protesters at the Oxford site are Jewish, including Kendall Gardener.\n\nThe PhD student reportedly labelled Sunak's comments on student anti-Semitism as political point-scoring, adding: \"I feel safer on this university campus than I would in other \u00adcontexts.\"\n\nOutside the camp, ex-British soldier John Wells, 65, looked on at the \u00adprotesters with a Star of David dangling from his neck.\n\nThe Jewish caretaker -- passing by on his bike -- told me: \"You only need a minority to turn up and start going on about Hamas.\n\n\"It will just set stuff off and give the police even more work to do.\"\n\nSome 40 tents also form a protest camp outside King's College in \u00adCambridge.\n\nFounded by Henry VI in 1441, former graduates include Britain's first Prime Minister Robert Walpole. \u00adcomputer pioneer Alan Turing and novelist Salman Rushdie\n\nOpposite the camp is The Eagle pub, where scientist Francis Crick told lunchtime drinkers that he and colleague James Watson had \"discovered the secret of life\" -- the structure of DNA -- on February 28. 1953.\n\nAgain, students at the camp declined to talk to me.\n\nThis week chants of \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" have rung out through \u00adCambridge's ancient streets.\n\nWhile a Jewish student who turned up at a rally at encampment this week has his Israeli flag snatched.\n\nAri Vladimir, 19, said: \"I came into the protest and unfurled my flag and almost immediately I was pushed, my flag was grabbed and thrown to the ground.\"\n\n'Waiting to kick off'\n\nHe said he was then ushered away by stewards \"for my own safety\".\n\nJewish students at Cambridge have called for the university to take urgent action after they say that the camp \"leaves many of us on edge\".\n\nLocals in Cambridge also called for the camp to be broken up.\n\nPasserby Mike McCall, 55, a former soldier, told me: \"That chant means wiping out Israel.\n\n\"Just because it's Cambridge and they are the students, they're given free rein and they shouldn't be.\"\n\nWhile data engineer Simon Brown, 53, from Harlow, Essex, glanced at the camp and called it \"pathetic\"\n\nHe was angry when pro-Palestinian protesters last month daubed red paint -- and the slogan \"divest from genocide\" -- on the walls of Trinity College's historic chapel.\n\n\"If half of them see a bandwagon, they jump on the back of it\n\n\"I watched the pro-Palestine marches in London and saw people creating a problem and being a \u00adnuisance.\n\n\"They were just waiting for something to kick off.\"\n\nProtest camp organisers say they hold Britain and Cambridge University \"complicit\" and \"partners\" in \"genocide\" of Palestinians.\n\nStudents say they won't move until the \u00aduniversity has disclosed \"financial and professional ties with complicit organisations\".\n\nStrolling past the camp, a company director in his 70s told me: \"If they're so upset with the university, which is one of the best in the world, then why come here?\n\n\"If the October 7 massacre of \u00adIsraelis had happened in Britain, what do you think we would be doing?\n\n\"We'd be fighting the terrorists so they wouldn't do it again.\"\n\nPassing the protest tents, local woman Mary Mortlock -- in her 40s -- said: \"This is not who we are.\n\n\"Here in Cambridge we try to look after people so they can study and feel comfortable and this is the way they repay us.\"\n\nPolice in both Oxford and \u00adCambridge have made no arrests as the stand-off -- which currently remains peaceful -- continues.\n\nA Cambridge University spokesman said they were committed to \"freedom of speech within the law\" and \"acknowledge the right to protest\".\n\nThey added: \"We ask everyone in our community to treat each other with understanding and empathy.\"\n\nOxford expressed similar sentiments adding that \"there is no place for intolerance\" at the university.\n\nThey say the Pitt Rivers Museum remains open.\n\nAs exam season approaches, many students will have to decide to return to their studies -- and secure their stellar careers.\n\nIt may leave another blow-hard American-inspired political firecracker slowly fizzling out.", "source": {"uri":

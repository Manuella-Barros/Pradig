With a lifetime record of 23-19 and ERA of 5.01, Bettis will give the Rockies dependency from the get-go, and almost acts as a trade deadline acquisition given that he hasn't stepped foot on the mound yet this season.\n\nPerformace aside, Bettis will give the Rockies an immediate spark within the clubhouse. All season long, Rockies players have sported shirts with themes about defeating cancer in support of Bettis.\n\nSince his diagnosis in November, Bettis has been a source of inspiration for the Rockies. When he returns, that inspiration could help elevate Colorado's play with the season dwindling down and pressure ramping up.\n\nThe Rockies will begin a four-game series with the Atlanta Braves Monday.

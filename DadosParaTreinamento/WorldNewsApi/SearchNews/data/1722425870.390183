{"id": 243228736, "title": "Lakers' Top Trade, NBA Free Agency Targets After Dejounte Murray Traded to Pelicans", "text": "With his uncertain future in Golden State, could the five-time All-Star shooting guard take a salary cut in order to play for his hometown team? Anthony Slater of The Athletic reported on June 22 that talks between Thompson and the Warriors were \"frozen\" and there was \"no productive discussion\" on a new contract. In fact, no deal was on the table at the time. The 34-year-old's connections to the purple and gold are clear. His father, Mychal Thompson, appeared in 335 games for the Lakers from 1986 through 1991. Also, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith said that the younger Thompson \"would love to be in Los Angeles\" on June 17. During an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show shortly after the trade deadline, Charania also mentioned the Lakers as a team that would be expected to express interest in Thompson. His fit with Los Angeles is clear, as his ability to keep opposing defenses scrambling without the ball in his hands has been well-documented throughout his career. Despite averaging a relatively disappointing 17.9 points per game last season, Thompson still hit the second-most catch-and-shoot threes in the association (via NBA.com). The Lakers may have some trouble beating out other teams, though. Matt Moore of Action Network reported on Thursday that the Orlando Magic would be willing to offer Thompson a two-year deal worth $50 million, which Los Angeles would not be able to match. However, there is an outside chance that he could accept a smaller deal and help the Lakers pursue a championship next to James and Davis.", "summary": "A potential Los Angeles Lakers offseason target went elsewhere on Friday, as the Atlanta Hawks traded guard Dejounte Murray to the New Orleans Pelicans.\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10126536-lakers-top-trade-nba-free-agency-targets-after-dejounte-murray-traded-to-pelicans", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_0,y_43,w_1800,h_1199,c_crop/v1719616392/tfve53cmz4jdffvoufyt.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:54:24", "author": "Zach Bachar", "authors": ["Zach Bachar"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.043}

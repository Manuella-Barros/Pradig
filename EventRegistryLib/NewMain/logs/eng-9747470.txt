Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin -- issued a joint statement Friday calling on Mr. Biden to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\" Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico soon became the third Senate Democrat to urge Mr. Biden withdraw from the campaign.\n\nTwo of the representatives, Veasey and Garcia, are part of key caucuses on Capitol Hill whose support Mr. Biden has courted and held onto as he tries to quell concerns about his fitness for a second term. Veasey is a member of Congressional Black Caucus and Garcia is in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nMr. Biden met with both groups earlier this month and participated in an economic summit co-hosted by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman, Rep. Steven Horsford, in Nevada on Tuesday. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus' political arm, BOLD PAC, endorsed the president Friday morning.\n\nBut Veasey, Garcia, Huffman and Pocan warned in their message, which was directed to the president, that public concerns about his age and fitness are putting at risk what they said should be a winning campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change,\" the lawmakers said. \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nThe four House Democrats said the party has a deep bench of young leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who are prepared to succeed Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month,\" they said. \"Mr. President, you have always put our country and our values first. We call on you to do it once again, so that we can come together and save the country we love.\"\n\nThe new insistence from the four House Democrats brings the total number of lawmakers publicly calling for Mr. Biden to step aside from the 2024 race to more than two dozen.\n\nIn his statement, Heinrich said Democrats need a candidate who can defeat Trump in November. While the New Mexico Democrat acknowledged it is solely up to Mr. Biden ato decide whether to end his campaign, he believes it's in the country's best interest for him to do so.\n\n\"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" Heinrich said.\n\nHe joins Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and Jon Tester of Montana, who is in a tough campaign to hold onto his Senate seat, in encouraging Mr. Biden to exit the presidential race.\n\nMr. Biden has so far bucked the pressure to call off his campaign, maintaining that voters selected him as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. While he has spent the weeks since the June 27 debate campaigning and participating in media interviews, the president was sidelined from the trail Wednesday when he tested positive for COVID-19 and returned to his home in Delaware to quarantine.\n\nMelissa Quinn\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

Martin Heinrich, who is running for re-election this fall, became the third Senate Democrat to call on Biden to leave the race, joining Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont and Sen. Jon Tester, who is facing a tough re-election bid in Montana.\n\nThe latest Biden defections in the House hail from some of the president's core constituencies of support. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus -- whose leaders campaigned with Biden this week in Nevada -- to call on Biden to bow out.\n\nVeasey and three other House Democrats -- Rep. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, issued a joint statement Friday praising Biden's decades of public service but saying it is now time for the 81-year-old president to \"pass the torch\" to give Democrats the best chance of beating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\nGarcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose chairwoman, Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n of California, also campaigned with Biden in Nevada this week and whose affiliated super PAC endorsed Biden on Friday. Other Hispanic Caucus members who earlier called for Biden to step aside are Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Mike Levin of California.\n\nMeanwhile, Pocan is chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus, formerly the LGBTQ+ Caucus, and the former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose most high-profile members -- including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- have been urging Democrats not to dump Biden.\n\nHuffman is also a progressive who is a close ally of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and represents a San Francisco Bay Area district next to hers.\n\nAnother close Bay Area ally of Pelosi's, longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also joined the group of detractors Friday, releasing a letter that she sent to Biden Thursday night. In it, Lofgren mentioned her work on the House Jan. 6 Committee, warning that Trump \"remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection.\"\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" Veasey, Garcia, Pocan and Huffman wrote in their joint statement. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\n\"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House. Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment,\" the quartet continued. \"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.\"\n\nSeparately, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois called on Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune published Friday. \"As long as this election is ... litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and 'senior moments,' I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat who is one of Republicans' top targets in 2024, said in a lengthy thread on X that \"there's too much on the line\" in 2024 for Biden to continue as the Democratic nominee.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, veteran Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., urged Biden to withdraw. She quickly endorsed Harris to replace him on the ballot and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former House member, to be her vice presidential running mate.\n\nMcCollum was soon followed by Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., the former chair of the House select committee on the climate crisis.\n\nThe new batch of defections means that more than 10% of House and Senate Democrats -- 30 out of 264 -- are calling for Biden to exit the race.\n\nBiden, however, has repeatedly said he's not going anywhere, and that he has earned the nomination, backed by 14 million Democratic primary voters.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon conceded that it's been a \"tough several weeks\" for Biden since his disastrous debate performance and that there has been \"some slippage in support.\" But she argued that Biden still has a path to defeating Trump and that he will be out on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid.\n\n\"You have heard from the president directly time and again.

Martin Heinrich, who is running for re-election this fall, became the third Senate Democrat to call on Biden to leave the race, joining Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont and Sen. Jon Tester, who is facing a tough re-election bid in Montana.\n\nThe latest Biden defections in the House hail from some of the president's core constituencies of support. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus -- whose leaders campaigned with Biden this week in Nevada -- to call on Biden to bow out.\n\nVeasey and three other House Democrats -- Rep. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, issued a joint statement Friday praising Biden's decades of public service but saying it is now time for the 82-year-old president to \"pass the torch\" to give Democrats the best chance of beating Republican nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\nGarcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose chairwoman, Rep. Nanette Barrag\u00e1n of California, also campaigned with Biden in Nevada this week and whose affiliated super PAC endorsed Biden on Friday. Other Hispanic Caucus members who earlier called for Biden to step aside are Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Mike Levin of California.\n\nMeanwhile, Pocan is chairman of the Congressional Equality Caucus, formerly the LGBTQ+ Caucus, and the former co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, whose most high-profile members -- including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. -- have been urging Democrats not to dump Biden.\n\nHuffman is also a progressive who is a close ally of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and represents a San Francisco Bay Area district next to hers.\n\nAnother close Bay Area ally of Pelosi's, longtime Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., also joined the group of detractors Friday, releasing a letter that she sent to Biden Thursday night. In it, Lofgren mentioned her work on the House Jan. 6 Committee, warning that Trump \"remains as grave a threat to the Constitutional order and rule of law that he was on January 6, 2021 when he incited insurrection.\"\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" Veasey, Garcia, Pocan and Huffman wrote in their joint statement. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\n\"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House. Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment,\" the quartet continued. \"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.\"\n\nSeparately, Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois called on Biden to drop out in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune published Friday. \"As long as this election is ... litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and 'senior moments,' I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd Rep. Greg Landsman, an Ohio Democrat who is one of Republicans' top targets in 2024, said in a lengthy thread on X that \"there's too much on the line\" in 2024 for Biden to continue as the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe new batch of defections means that more than 10% of House and Senate Democrats -- 30 out of 264 -- are calling for Biden to exit the race.\n\nBiden, however, has repeatedly said he's not going anywhere, and that he has earned the nomination, backed by 14 million Democratic primary voters.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Friday, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon conceded that it's been a \"tough several weeks\" for Biden since his disastrous debate performance and that there has been \"some slippage in support.\" But she argued that Biden still has a path to defeating Trump and that he will be out on the campaign trail next week once he recovers from Covid.\n\n\"You have heard from the president directly time and again. He is in this race to win and he is our nominee and he's going to be our president for a second term,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"},

Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin -- issued a joint statement Friday calling on Mr. Biden to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\" Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico soon became the third Senate Democrat to urge Mr. Biden withdraw from the campaign.\n\nTwo of the representatives, Veasey and Garcia, are part of key caucuses on Capitol Hill whose support Mr. Biden has courted and held onto as he tries to quell concerns about his fitness for a second term. Veasey is a member of Congressional Black Caucus and Garcia is in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nMr. Biden met with both groups earlier this month and participated in an economic summit co-hosted by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman, Rep. Steven Horsford, in Nevada on Tuesday. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus' political arm, BOLD PAC, endorsed the president Friday morning.\n\nBut Veasey, Garcia, Huffman and Pocan warned in their message, which was directed to the president, that public concerns about his age and fitness are putting at risk what they said should be a winning campaign against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change,\" the lawmakers said. \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nThe four House Democrats said the party has a deep bench of young leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who are prepared to succeed Mr. Biden.\n\n\"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month,\" they said. \"Mr. President, you have always put our country and our values first. We call on you to do it once again, so that we can come together and save the country we love.\"\n\nThe new insistence from the four House Democrats brings the total number of lawmakers publicly calling for Mr. Biden to step aside from the 2024 race to more than two dozen.\n\nIn his statement, Heinrich said Democrats need a candidate who can defeat Trump in November. While the New Mexico Democrat acknowledged it is solely up to Mr. Biden ato decide whether to end his campaign, he believes it's in the country's best interest for him to do so.\n\n\"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy,\" Heinrich said.\n\nHe joins Sens. Peter Welch of Vermont and Jon Tester of Montana, who is in a tough campaign to hold onto his Senate seat, in encouraging Mr. Biden to exit the presidential race.\n\nMr. Biden has so far bucked the pressure to call off his campaign, maintaining that voters selected him as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. While he has spent the weeks since the June 27 debate campaigning and participating in media interviews, the president was sidelined from the trail Wednesday when he tested positive for COVID-19 and returned to his home in Delaware to quarantine.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There has been speculation that Biden might leave the race on his own, but many lawmakers who have expressed private doubt about his prospects are expected to go public if he does not.\n\nThe group of lawmakers who went public is significant because they come from factions of the party that have largely stuck with Biden: Huffman is a leading progressive; Veasey is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to urge Biden out of the race; Garcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which has also sided with keeping Biden in the race.\n\nThe statement does not specify a replacement or a process for finding one but gives a nod to Biden's running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris. Democrats have been divided over whether to hold an open process or anoint Harris in the event Biden drops out.\n\n\"Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered and prepared for this moment,\" the statement continues. \"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign.\"\n\nBiden and his team remain steadfast publicly that he will stay in the race, arguing he has the best chance of winning.\n\n\"We're looking at polling. We're seeing ... what a lot of people are seeing, of course,\" said Biden's campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, on \"Morning Joe.\" \"But we're also looking at a lot of numbers that matter, which is what is happening on the ground.\"\n\nDillon said the campaign is built for a close race and that opinions of the Republican nominee, former President Trump, are \"hardened.\" She argued that Trump would not gain voters concerned about Biden; Democrats simply need to win them back by knocking on doors and other organizing efforts.\n\nShe said Biden, who has had no events since a COVID-19 diagnosis late Wednesday, would return to the campaign trail next week.\n\n\"We know that we've slipped a bit from the debate,\" she said, referring to Biden's dismal performance last month that set off Democratic concerns. \"And we know that the president has to prove to the American people exactly what he believes, that he's in this to win, that he can do this.\"\n\nBiden has been under extreme pressure to leave the race, intensifying this week as party leaders see national and swing state polling that make his path to victory look dire. Multiple reports have suggested he could leave the race this weekend. Polls show large majorities of voters, including Democrats, would also like him to withdraw from the campaign.\n\nSen. Jon Tester of Montana, considered the most politically vulnerable Democrat in the Senate, called for a change at the top of the ticket Thursday night, just as Trump was accepting his party's nomination.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "m.arcamax.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arcamax_publishing@m.arcamax.com", "name": "ArcaMax Publishing", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuy_Garc\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuy Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jen_O'Malley_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jen O'Malley Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/298/29856/2985600.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747470", "eventUri": "eng-9747470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

People wonder whether our nation -- and indeed, our world -- can survive another Trump administration.\"\n\n\"If the upcoming election is a referendum on past performance, future promises, and character, I have every confidence Biden would win,\" Casten continued. \"But politics, like life, isn't fair. And as long as this election is instead litigated over which candidate is more likely to be held accountable for public gaffes and 'senior moments,' I believe that Biden is not only going to lose but is also uniquely incapable of shifting that conversation.\"\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he added. \"To manage an exit with all the dignity and decency that has guided his half-century of public service. To cement his legacy as the president who saved our democracy in 2020 and handed it off to trusted hands in 2024 who could carry his legacy forward.\"\n\nRep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) on Friday explained his new call for Biden to step aside in a series of posts on X, while Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) released a lengthy statement, which was dated for Thursday.\n\nFour other House Democrats -- Reps. Jes\u00fas G. \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda (Ill.), Jared Huffman (Calif.), Mark Pocan (Wis.), and Marc Veasey (Texas) -- issued a joint statement urging 81-year-old Biden to withdraw from the presidential contest.\n\n\"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" they said. \"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past few years.\"\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign. These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change,\" they warned. \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nSince the debate, Biden has faced public and reported private pressure to \"pass the torch\" from a growing number of Democratic lawmakers, public figures, and organizers. Many of the members of Congress have been white \"moderates,\" while leading progressives including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have stuck with the president.\n\n\"Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment.\"\n\nNotably, Garc\u00eda, Huffman, and Pocan are members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Garc\u00eda is also part of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus -- whose political arm formally endorsed Biden on Friday morning. Veasey is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to openly urge the president to step aside.\n\n\"Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, who you have lifted up, empowered, and prepared for this moment,\" the four congressmen said. Polling released Friday by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 6 in 10 Democrats believe Harris would do a good job as president.\n\n\"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month,\" they concluded. \"Mr. President, you have always been our country and our values first. We call on you to do it once again, so that we can come together and save the country we love.\"\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) similarly argued in a Friday statement urging Biden to exit the race that \"by passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy.\"\n\nAfter surviving an assassination attempt last weekend, Trump this week announced Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate and formally accepted the GOP nomination in a long, rambly speech at the Republican National Conventional in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is planned for August 19-22 in Chicago, Illinois, but the party is planning a \"virtual roll call\" among delegates to nominate Biden -- who is currently isolating in Delaware due to a Covid-19 infection -- before the event. Biden said Friday that he plans to be back on the campaign trail next week.\n\nHeinrich is the third Senate Democrat to push Biden to withdraw, following Sen. John Tester (D-Mont.) on Thursday and Sen. Peter Welch (Vt.) last week. They are joined by over 20 other House members and various other current and former officials.\n\nThere is also the newly launched Pass the Torch campaign and fresh calls from the Step Aside Joe campaign sponsored by RootsAction.org, which started urging Biden to not seek reelection long before last month's disastrous debate.\n\n\"Twenty months ago, just after the 2022 midterm elections, we launched a campaign for Joe Biden to voluntarily be a one-term president, and the Step Aside Joe campaign has continued to urge that realism prevail over wishful thinking,\" the initiative said in a statement Friday. \"As our country has faced the extremist Republican threat, we have persisted in pointing out that the Democratic Party needs a much stronger standard-bearer than Biden, someone capable of articulating a popular vision that could galvanize a solid electoral majority.\"\n\n\"It's sad, in fact tragic, that the party leadership has waited until just the last few days to publicly acknowledge what has long been apparent: Biden is unable to speak effectively or act decisively to counter the MAGA movement,\" the campaign added. \"It shouldn't have taken a thoroughly disastrous debate performance to set off alarm bells. Long overdue, Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race can open up vital possibilities that his candidacy has foreclosed.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common

Garcia, Huffman and Pocan are considered progressives, with the latter having previously served as co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nU.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., also issued a statement Friday urging Biden not to run for reelection, KOB News reported. The senator praised Biden for being \"one of the most accomplished presidents in modern history,\" and complimented him for his years of public service and leadership, but said it was time to go for the good of the country.\n\n\"The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy.

Marc Veasey of Fort Worth on Friday became the second House Democrat from Texas and the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, putting another dent in Biden's armor as he clings to his candidacy.\n\n\"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" Veasey and Reps. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin wrote in a joint letter sent to Biden and published in a news release Friday.\n\nThe announcement comes more than two weeks after U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, became the first Congress member to urge Biden to stand down. Veasey had previously expressed concern about the effect Biden's continued candidacy would have on down-ballot races in comments July 9 to CNN.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the letter said. \"Passing the torch would fundamentally change the trajectory of the campaign. It would reinvigorate the race and infuse Democrats with enthusiasm and momentum heading into our convention next month.\"\n\nWhile the officials do not explicitly endorse a replacement for Biden at the top of the ticket, the representatives wrote that \"Democrats have a deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nThe lawmakers' note urging Biden to withdraw adds to similar calls from more than a dozen other Congress members. However, it puts Veasey at odds with other Texas members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Democratic Reps. Jasmine Crockett of Dallas and Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston have been among Biden's most vocal advocates after support for him plummeted due to his lackluster debate performance in June against former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that Biden might call off his campaign as early as this weekend, but some Congress members have highlighted continued concerns about what a post-primary switch-up could mean.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the most progressive members of Congress, on Thursday night told her Instagram followers that pundits, donors and strategists might be underestimating legal challenges to a convention-day nomination and that the short timeline any new candidate would have to campaign could imperil Democratic chances to keep the White House in November.", "source":

The move makes Pocan the first Wisconsin Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nOther Wisconsin Democrats have refrained from calling on Biden to step aside but have acknowledged concerns from voters in a battleground state that will critical on the to the White House. U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, for example, said she conveyed constituent concerns to the White House but has declined to say whether Biden should remain on the ticket as she has avoided talk of the president.\n\nBaldwin is in a tight reelection race against Republican businessman Eric Hovde.\n\nPocan's announcement comes just one day after Republican concluded their presidential nominating convention in Milwaukee on Thursday. Republicans sought to present a unified front of support for Trump throughout the last week following the failed assassination attempt against the former president.\n\nIn their message Friday, Pocan and his fellow Democrats said they admire Biden and have \"sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership.\" They noted they wanted Biden to finish his current term.\n\nBut they said Democrats \"must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years.\"\n\nPocan this week had hinted he might join the growing number of Democrats in calling on Biden to step aside.\n\nHe told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Thursday that he had heard concerns from constituents over Biden's viability, saying: \"If I told you there was a two-hour period of any day this week that someone didn't reach out to me personally, much less reach out to my office, I would be lying.\"\n\nAnd Thursday night he tweeted his own survey on X.\n\n\"What do you think President Joe Biden (should) do?,\" he asked, listing the options: \"Pass the torch, Stick in there and don't know.\"", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Wisconsin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

They argue that, fairly or not, Biden will not be able to assuage concerns.\n\n\"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House,\" the letter states.\n\nThe union of these lawmakers is notable. Veasey, a moderate, is the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to ask Biden to drop out of the race. Garcia, Huffman and Pocan are considered progressives, with the latter having previously served as co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nU.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., also issued a statement Friday urging Biden not to run for reelection, KOB News reported. The senator praised Biden for being \"one of the most accomplished presidents in modern history,\" and complimented him for his years of public service and leadership, but said it was time to go for the good of the country.\n\n\"The return of Donald Trump to the White House poses an existential danger to our democracy. We must defeat him in November, and we need a candidate who can do that,\" Heinrich wrote.\n\nAlso Friday, Rep. Zoe Lofrgren, D-Calif., an ally of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., added her name to the list of 20-plus Democrats publicly calling on Biden to drop out.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Biden, she asked Biden to \"allow another Democratic candidate to compete.\" If he decides not to, Lofgren said she would still support his candidacy.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" she added, \"I greatly doubt the outcome will be positive and our country will pay a dreadful price for that.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heinrich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Heinrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Progressive_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Progressive Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/https://media2.salon.com/2024/07/marc_veasey_2160895331.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747470", "eventUri": "eng-9747470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois made his case in an opinion piece in the Chicago Tribune, Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico issued a statement, and four other representatives penned a joint letter.\n\nAs the president isolates at his beach house with COVID-19, his team is under mounting pressure, with top Democrats reportedly pushing for him to drop out. This morning's defectors join 20 other House Democrats and two senators who have called on the president to step aside.\n\nIn his opinion piece entitled, \"It's time for Joe Biden to pass the torch,\" Casten said that he believes Biden will lose the general election. Though he began the piece by praising Biden's record and character, Casten argued that the president is no longer fit for the job.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote. Doing so, he argued, would save Biden's legacy.\n\nRepresentatives Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin wrote a joint letter to Biden that also called on him to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\"\n\nThey, too, expressed admiration for Biden's personal and political record, before commenting on the importance of beating Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" they wrote. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\nIn their letter, the four representatives mention Vice President Kamala Harris as a leader of the next generation of Democrats. Many believe that Harris is best-positioned to become the Democratic nominee should Biden step aside. Illustrating the persistent divides within the Democratic party, Garcia is a part of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising apparatus endorsed Biden this morning.\n\nHeinrich followed a similar format, starting his statement by celebrating Biden's accomplishments before moving on to discussing the importance of keeping Trump out of the White House.\n\n\"While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,\" Heinrich said. \"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden insists that he plans to stay in the race for now, but some top Democrats believe that his determination may be starting to let up in the face of waning support and dire poll numbers.\n\nThe continued fallout for Biden wasn't limited to just Friday morning, however: Shortly after this story was published early Friday afternoon, two other elected Democrats called on Biden to resign: Rep Greg Landsman of Ohio and Rep.

Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, a national co-chair of the Biden campaign, said Friday on CNN she is \"100 percent\" sure Biden is staying in the race, contrary to news reports suggesting he's more receptive to calls to step aside.\n\nShe said those news accounts are not coming from inside the Biden campaign and noted Biden has repeatedly said he is not dropping out.\n\nAsked if she was hearing from colleagues who want Biden to quit, Escobar said she is hearing more from colleagues who are working to support the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe noted the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus just announced its endorsement of Biden and cited a letter from prominent Black women leaders in support of the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\n\"There is a strong coalition of support that exists throughout this country,\" Escobar said.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuy_Garc\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuy Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_Crockett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasmine Crockett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Escobar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veronica Escobar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Allred", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Allred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

They join 20 other congressional Democrats who have publicly asked the president to step aside. Biden insists he's still running, but top Dems reportedly think his determination is thawing.\n\nSix more Democratic lawmakers on Friday added themselves to the list of elected officials calling on Biden to end his reelection bid -- and all this by 11 am ET. Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois made his case in an opinion piece in the Chicago Tribune, Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico issued a statement, and four other representatives penned a joint letter.\n\nAs the president isolates at his beach house with COVID-19, his team is under mounting pressure, with top Democrats reportedly pushing for him to drop out. This morning's defectors join 20 other House Democrats and two senators who have called on the president to step aside.\n\nIn his opinion piece entitled, \"It's time for Joe Biden to pass the torch,\" Casten said that he believes Biden will lose the general election. Though he began the piece by praising Biden's record and character, Casten argued that the president is no longer fit for the job.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote. Doing so, he argued, would save Biden's legacy.\n\nRepresentatives Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin wrote a joint letter to Biden that also called on him to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\"\n\nThey, too, expressed admiration for Biden's personal and political record, before commenting on the importance of beating Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" they wrote. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\nIn their letter, the four representatives mention Vice President Kamala Harris as a leader of the next generation of Democrats. Many believe that Harris is best-positioned to become the Democratic nominee should Biden step aside. Illustrating the persistent divides within the Democratic party, Garcia is a part of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising apparatus endorsed Biden this morning.\n\nHeinrich followed a similar format, starting his statement by celebrating Biden's accomplishments before moving on to discussing the importance of keeping Trump out of the White House.\n\n\"While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,\" Heinrich said. \"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden insists that he plans to stay in the race for now, but some top Democrats believe that his determination may be starting to let up in the face of waning support and dire poll numbers.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl",

This morning's defectors join 20 other House Democrats and two senators who have called on the president to step aside.\n\nIn his opinion piece entitled, \"It's time for Joe Biden to pass the torch,\" Casten said that he believes Biden will lose the general election. Though he began the piece by praising Biden's record and character, Casten argued that the president is no longer fit for the job.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote. Doing so, he argued, would save Biden's legacy.\n\nRepresentatives Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin wrote a joint letter to Biden that also called on him to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\"\n\nThey, too, expressed admiration for Biden's personal and political record, before commenting on the importance of beating Donald Trump in November.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" they wrote. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\nIn their letter, the four representatives mention Vice President Kamala Harris as a leader of the next generation of Democrats. Many believe that Harris is best-positioned to become the Democratic nominee should Biden step aside. Illustrating the persistent divides within the Democratic party, Garcia is a part of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, whose fundraising apparatus endorsed Biden this morning.\n\nHeinrich followed a similar format, starting his statement by celebrating Biden's accomplishments before moving on to discussing the importance of keeping Trump out of the White House.\n\n\"While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,\" Heinrich said. \"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nBiden insists that he plans to stay in the race for now, but some top Democrats believe that his determination may be starting to let up in the face of waning support and dire poll numbers.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alice_tecotzky@businessinsider.com", "name": "Alice Tecotzky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Hispanic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Hispanic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/669a8e11fb2b6bedb058bc27?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747470", "eventUri": "eng-9747470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

We call on you to do it once again so that we can come together and save the country we love.\"\n\nAlternative candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris, are all polling stronger than the incumbent against Trump.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly all polled roughly five points above Biden across all battleground states, according to the poll.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,\" the letter reads.\n\nBiden has repeatedly affirmed that he intends to stay in the race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He abruptly cut his trip short and flew to his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\nBoarding Air Force One Wednesday, Biden struggled to walk up the shorter stairs that pull out from under the plane. And after arriving in Dover, he again struggled deplaning, and Secret Service appeared to physically help him into the waiting SUV.\n\nBut Biden's determination to return to the campaign trail appears to be because his team is reenergized by Trump's speech.\n\n\"He's playing the greatest hits from 2016 - Trump has not changed, he has not moderated, he has gotten worse,\" a Biden adviser said Thursday night. \"And he is making no appeal to moderates.\"\n\nThe president said Trump laid out a \"dark vision\" for America's future and that \"Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.\"\n\nBut his party is not together. Democrats remain split on whether Biden can beat Trump in November and on Friday at least 10 Democrats joined the chorus calling on Biden to resign, including Texas Rep. Marc Veasey, the first member from the influential Congressional Black Caucus to do so.\n\n\"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" Veasey co-wrote in a letter with Reps. Jared Huffman, Chuy Garcia, and Mark Pocan.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy... At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the four congressmen added.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, who represents a battleground Ohio district, both also pointed to Trump and the risk to \"democracy\" for reasons Biden should exit.\n\nThere is too much on the line, and we have to be able to make that case to the American people about the change we need and the country we all deserve,\" Landsman wrote in his statement. \"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case.\"\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a close ally of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a letter addressed to the president on Thursday, but was first reported on Friday, made a similar argument doubting Biden can effectively run a winning campaign.\n\n\"I want to be clear that should you formally become the Democratic nominee for President I will do everything I can to promote your candidacy and to work for your success,\" Lofgren wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News. \"Unfortunately, I greatly doubt that the outcome will be positive, and our country will pay a dreadful price for that.\"\n\nBiden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon admitted on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday that they have seen Biden's support slip.\n\n\"I'm not here to say that this hasn't been a tough several weeks for the campaign,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"There's no doubt that it has been, and we've definitely seen some slippage in support, but it has been a small movement, and you know this, the reason is because so much of this race is hardened already.\"\n\nIn what was a bruising day for the president, with the calls from congressional Democrats urging him to drop out swelling to 34 by ABC News's count, Biden did get critical support from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe group's political arm, BOLD PAC, on Friday endorsed the president, a week after his call with the group, saying he and Vice President Kamala Harris \"have delivered for the Latino community.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Adam Schiff, who was the lead impeachment manager in Trump's first impeachment trial, called on Biden to drop out, saying in a statement that he had \"serious concerns\" about the president's ability to win a second term.\n\nAnd Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, who was a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol, stopped short of explicitly calling on Biden to step down, but urged the president to reconsider whether he should remain in the presidential race.\n\nBiden remained at home in Delaware with no public events scheduled after testing positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" early Friday, Biden campaign co-chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said the president remained \"absolutely\" in the race, even as a growing number of Democrats voiced unease about his ability to defeat Trump.\n\n\"Absolutely the president is in this race, you've heard him say that time and time again,\" she said. \"He is the best person to take on Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut reports also surfaced Friday that Vice President Kamala Harris, a potential replacement for Biden if he takes the unprecedented step of withdrawing from a race less than four months from Election Day, was scheduled to speak by phone with top Democratic donors in the afternoon.\n\nHarris did not respond to reporters' questions at an appearance at a Washington ice cream shop Friday, according to a pool report.\n\nAnd 10 more congressional Democrats, including more senior members than had previously broken ranks with the president, said Friday that Biden should step aside.\n\nU.S. Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune.\n\nReps. Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas, Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin wrote a joint open letter to Biden that they posted on social media.\n\nThe quartet represents important constituencies in the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nVeasey is the first member of the influential Congressional Black Caucus, which has been among Biden's staunchest Democratic backers, to join the call for him to step down. He is also a member of the moderate New Democrat Coalition.\n\nPocan is the co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\nGarcia is a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nU.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Reps. Greg Landsman of Ohio, Zoe Lofgren of California also released their own statements. Betty McCollum of Minnesota told the Star Tribune newspaper she wanted Biden step aside and allow Harris to lead the ticket with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nRep. Morgan McGarvey, of Kentucky, posted a statement on X.\n\nThe calls came a day after Sen. Jon Tester, in a difficult reelection race in Montana, said in a statement to the Daily Montanan that Biden should withdraw.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who was one of few Democrats who called on Biden to step down two weeks ago, expanded on his view in an op-ed Friday.\n\nMoulton wrote in the Boston Globe that when he went on a June trip to Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the president didn't recognize him, despite their decade-long relationship.\n\n\"Of course, that can happen as anyone ages, but as I watched the disastrous debate a few weeks ago, I have to admit that what I saw in Normandy was part of a deeper problem,\" Moulton wrote. \"It was a crushing realization, and not because a person I care about had a rough night but because everything is riding on Biden's ability to beat Donald Trump in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news",

He abruptly cut his trip short and flew to his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\nBoarding Air Force One Wednesday, Biden struggled to walk up the shorter stairs that pull out from under the plane. And after arriving in Dover, he again struggled deplaning, and Secret Service appeared to physically help him into the waiting SUV.\n\nBut Biden's determination to return to the campaign trail appears to be because his team is reenergized by Trump's speech.\n\n\"He's playing the greatest hits from 2016 - Trump has not changed, he has not moderated, he has gotten worse,\" a Biden adviser said Thursday night. \"And he is making no appeal to moderates.\"\n\nThe president said Trump laid out a \"dark vision\" for America's future and that \"Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.\"\n\nBut his party is not together. Democrats remain split on whether Biden can beat Trump in November and on Friday at least 10 Democrats joined the chorus calling on Biden to resign, including Texas Rep. Marc Veasey, the first member from the influential Congressional Black Caucus to do so.\n\nMORE: 2024 election live updates: 'I look forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week': Biden\n\n\"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" Veasey co-wrote in a letter with Reps. Jared Huffman, Chuy Garcia, and Mark Pocan.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy... At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the four congressmen added.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, who represents a battleground Ohio district, both also pointed to Trump and the risk to \"democracy\" for reasons Biden should exit.\n\nThere is too much on the line, and we have to be able to make that case to the American people about the change we need and the country we all deserve,\" Landsman wrote in his statement. \"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case.\"\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a close ally of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a letter addressed to the president on Thursday, but was first reported on Friday, made a similar argument doubting Biden can effectively run a winning campaign.\n\n\"I want to be clear that should you formally become the Democratic nominee for President I will do everything I can to promote your candidacy and to work for your success,\" Lofgren wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News. \"Unfortunately, I greatly doubt that the outcome will be positive, and our country will pay a dreadful price for that.\"\n\nBiden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon admitted on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday that they have seen Biden's support slip.\n\n\"I'm not here to say that this hasn't been a tough several weeks for the campaign,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"There's no doubt that it has been, and we've definitely seen some slippage in support, but it has been a small movement, and you know this, the reason is because so much of this race is hardened already.\"\n\nIn what was a bruising day for the president, with the calls from congressional Democrats urging him to drop out swelling to 34 by ABC News's count, Biden did get critical support from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe group's political arm, BOLD PAC, on Friday endorsed the president, a week after his call with the group, saying he and Vice President Kamala Harris \"have delivered for the Latino community.\"\n\nABC News' Lauren Peller contributed to this report.\n\nBiden says he's returning to campaign trail next week as calls grow for

Marc Veasey Is First Congressional Black Caucus Member To Call Fo", "body": "Black America Web Featured Video CLOSE\n\nRep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, arrives at the Rayburn Building on May 24, 2023. | Source: Tom Williams / Getty\n\nTexas Rep. Marc Veasey on Friday became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to call for President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 election to allow another Democrat to run against Donald Trump.\n\nPolitico reported that Veasey, who represents Texas' 33rd Congressional District, was among four more Democrats formally making those calls in a letter sent to Biden addressing concerns about the president's \"fitness\" to be the party's nominee at its convention next month.\n\nThe CBC remains among those Democrats staunchly defending Biden's candidacy amid weeks of scrutiny following the president's unfortunate performance debating Trump last month. But Veasey's inclusion in a growing group of Democrats calling for Biden to step aside could mean others in the influential and powerful group of Black Congressmen and women are soon to follow.\n\nThe other three Democrats with Veasey include Illinois Rep. Chuy Garcia, who similarly broke from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to become the first member of that group to publicly call for Biden to drop out.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign. These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change,\" the letter, also signed by California Rep. Jared Huffman and Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, said in part before adding later: \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nThe letter called for Vice President Harris to be considered as Biden's replacement among a \"bench of young leaders.\"\n\nThe letter comes days after Biden was in Las Vegas this week specifically courting Black and Latino voters at the NAACP Convention and the UnidosUS, the latter for which he was forced to cancel a speech after being diagnosed with Covid.\n\nJust last week, the CBC held a call with Biden to express their confidence with him being the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"None of the members who attended the virtual meeting expressed any doubts to the president about his electability or said he should step aside,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nAlso on Monday, CBC Chair and Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford said in a statement that \"Biden is the nominee.\"\n\nThat came one day after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted a similar call with fellow House Democrats to help convince them to keep supporting Biden's candidacy. Jeffries said at the time that he \"has not changed\" his opinion about Biden's candidacy.\n\nHowever, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Jeffries has privately warned Biden that his candidacy could doom Democrats.\n\nThe whirlwind of developments took another turn Friday after NBC News reported that Biden's family has begun discussing a strategy for him to exit the race, suggesting it's just a matter of time before he drops out.\n\nIf and when that happens, it could risk alienating and undermining the Black voters who are credited with securing Biden's election in 2020 and voting for him to be the Democratic nominee in primary elections this year.\n\n\"To the majority of Black Voters, the Biden-Harris ticket has delivered on enough of those promises to stand with this ticket today,\" Cliff Albright and LaTosha Brown, co-founders of Black Voters Matter, and April England-Albright, National Legal Director of Black Voters Matter, said in a statement this week. \"In spite of this, the recent nervous cry for Biden to step aside -- led largely by white congresspeople, pundits, and donors -- threatens to mute and overlook the voices of Black Voters. Such a step by the Democratic Party would not only impact the enthusiasm of Black Voters in this year's general election, but it would impact Black turnout for decades to come while deepening the widespread belief that the Democratic Party takes our voters for granted.\"\n\nA new poll of voters in seven swing states found that a \"qualified Democratic candidate younger than Biden\" leads Trump by more than even percentage points.\n\nBroken down along racial lines, the poll also found that a \"majority of white (54%) and Hispanic (55%) voters think Biden should withdraw, while a majority of Black voters (65%) think he should not.\"\n\nThis is America.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nRNC Racism: Recapping All The Anti-Blackness At Republicans' Convention In Milwaukee\n\n'If You Don't Vote Donald Trump, You Ain't Black,' Michigan Rep.

Betty McCollum (D-MN) and Kathy Castor (D-FL)\n\nMcCollum and Castor, called on President Joe Biden to step aside and pass the torch -- to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMcCollum endorsed Harris as Biden's successor and encouraged Democrats to select Gov. Tim Waltz (D-MN) as her running mate.\n\n\"Winning in November and defeating [former President Donald] Trump's dangerous, hate-filled agenda must be Democrats' sole focus,\" McCollum said in a statement via the Star Tribune. \"To give Democrats a strong, viable path to winning the White House, I am calling upon President Biden to release his delegates and empower Vice President Harris to step forward to become the Democratic nominee for president.\"\n\nCastor said it is an \"exciting time to possibly pass the torch,\" and also noted that Harris would be a good pick for the party as the new nominee.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA)\n\nThe close ally to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the former speaker, became the 30th sitting Democrat on July 19.\n\n\"Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,\" Lofgren wrote in a letter to Biden. \"It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our party's nomination to allow another Democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.\"\n\nRep. Greg Landsman (D-OH)\n\nLandsman became the 29th Democrat on July 19.\n\n\"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM)\n\nHeinrich, up for reelection but in a safe seat, on July 19 became the latest Democrat to urge Biden to \"pass the torch\" to another candidate. He marked the third Senate Democrat and the 28th sitting Democrat overall to take such a stance.\n\n\"While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,\" Heinrich said in a statement. \"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy.\"\n\nReps. Jared Huffman (D-CA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), Chuy Garcia (D-IL), and Mark Pocan (D-WI)\n\nIn a joint statement on July 19, the quartet said \"widespread public concerns\" about Biden's ability to beat Trump \"may not be fair\" but have nonetheless \"hardened\" in the past weeks of fallout. Veasey is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, where Biden has retained broad support -- until now. Pocan is chair emeritus of the Progressive Caucus.\n\nThe four members became the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th current Congress members to call for Biden's withdrawal.\n\n\"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House,\" the lawmakers said.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-IL)\n\nCasten was the 23rd sitting Democrat to say Biden should leave the race.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Joe Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote in a Chicago Tribune op-ed. \"To manage an exit with all the dignity and decency that has guided his half-century of public service. To cement his legacy as the president who saved our democracy in 2020 and handed it off to trusted hands in 2024 who could carry his legacy forward.\"\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT)\n\nTester, up for reelection, is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this election cycle and represents a state Trump carried by double digits. He became the second Democrat in the Senate and the 22nd Democrat in Congress to do so.\n\n\"I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I've never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,\" Tester said in a statement July 18. \"And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA)\n\nA Senate candidate for the seat held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Schiff on July 17 said that \"while the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch.\"\n\nA high-profile Democrat who was an impeachment manager against Trump, Schiff is a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nRep. Mike Levin (D-CA)\n\nLevin said in a July 12 statement: \"The time has come for President Biden to pass the torch.\"\n\n\"Making this statement is not easy,\" he continued. \"I have deep respect for President Biden's five plus decades of public service and incredible appreciation for the work we've done together these last three and a half years.\"\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen (D-CO)\n\nPettersen urged Biden to \"pass the torch\" in a statement issued July 12, the day after Biden's NATO press conference.\n\n\"Joe Biden saved our country once, and I'm joining the growing number of people in my district and across the country to ask him to do it again,\" Pettersen wrote. \"Please pass the torch to one of our many capable Democratic leaders, so we have the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, who is the greatest threat to the foundation of this country that we have ever faced.\"\n\nRep. Eric Sorensen (D-IL)\n\nSorenson, a front-line Democrat, said July 11 he is \"hopeful\" that Biden will step aside and put county over party \"again.\"\n\n\"It is more important than ever that our neighbors have a candidate for president who will communicate a positive vision for every person in this country. Someone who can demonstrate the strength and wisdom needed to lead us through the worst storms,\" Sorenson said in a statement on X after Biden's press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nSorenson was the 17th Democratic lawmaker to ask Biden to suspend his bid for the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nRep. Scott Peters (D-CA)\n\nPeters called on Biden to withdraw July 11 shortly after the president wrapped up an almost hourlong Q&A session with reporters.\n\n\"Today I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign,\" Peters wrote in a statement obtained by Politico. \"The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course.\"\n\nPeters is the 16th Democratic lawmaker to call on Biden to suspend his reelection campaign.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-CT)\n\nHimes called on Biden to exit the race just minutes after the president concluded his press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., on July 11.\n\nHimes became the 15th sitting Democratic lawmaker to call on Biden to withdraw ahead of the convention in August.\n\n\"Joe Biden's record of public service is unrivaled. His accomplishments are immense. His legacy as a great president is secure,\" Himes wrote on X. \"He must not risk that legacy, those accomplishments, and American democracy to soldier on in the face of the horrors promised by Donald Trump.\"\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA)\n\nPerez is a co-chair of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and one of few Democrats representing a district Trump won in 2020.\n\nOn July 11, she said in a statement: \"I doubt the president's judgment about his health, his fitness to do the job, and whether he is the one making important decisions about our country.\"\n\nShe added: \"Americans deserve to feel their president is fit enough to do the job ... The president should do what he knows is right for the country.\"\n\nRep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ)\n\nAhead of a press conference from Biden on July 11, Stanton issued a statement calling on Biden to step aside because the \"Democratic Party must have a nominee who can effectively make the case against Trump, and have the confidence of the American people to handle the rigors of the hardest job on the planet for the next four years.\"\n\nStanton continued, \"For the sake of American democracy, and to continue to make progress on our shared priorities, I believe it is time for the President to step aside as our nominee.\"\n\nRep. Ed Case (D-HI)\n\nCase joined the chorus of Democrats calling on Biden to step aside July 11, telling Punchbowl News his \"guidepost is what is the best way forward for our country\" and that he does not \"believe President Biden should continue his candidacy for re-election as President.\"\n\nRep. Brad Schneider (D-IL)\n\nSchneider, vice chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, called on Biden to suspend his reelection campaign and allow the party to select a new nominee.\n\n\"I love President Biden. I am forever grateful for his leadership and service to our nation,\" Schneider said in a statement July 11. \"The time has come, however, for President Biden to heroically pass the torch to a new generation of leadership to guide us to the future he has enabled and empowered us to pursue.\"\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition, the largest Democratic caucus in the House, is made up of 100 House Democrats, and Schneider speaks frequently with the most vulnerable members of the party.\n\nRep. Hillary Scholten (D-MI)\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nScholten, a vulnerable Democrat, joined nine of her colleagues to call on Biden to withdraw from the race as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"For the good of our Democracy, I believe it is time for him to step aside from the presidential race and allow a new leader to step up,\" Scholten said in a statement posted July 11 on X.\n\nScholten is a part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's 2024 Frontline Program, which seeks to help vulnerable Democrats keep their seats.\n\nSen. Peter Welch (D-VT)\n\nWelch was the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee on July 10.\n\nThe Vermont senator, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, asked Biden to step aside after \"the national conversation is focused on Biden's age and capacity.\"\n\n\"I, like folks across the country, am worried about November's election,\" Welch writes. \"The stakes could not be higher. We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night.\"\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR)\n\nBlumenauer was the ninth House Democrat as of July 10 to say Biden should exit the race.\n\n\"While this is a decision for the president and the first lady, I hope they will come to the conclusion that I and others have: President Biden should not be the Democratic presidential nominee,\" he said in a statement. \"It is a painful and difficult conclusion, but there is no question in my mind that we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\nRep.\n\nPat Ryan\n\n(D-NY)\n\nRyan, the only vulnerable Democrat in New York, was the eighth House Democrat to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race on July 10.\n\nRyan posted on X that Biden is \"no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump.\"\n\nRyan asserted that for the good of the country, Biden should step aside and \"deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ)\n\nOn July 9, Sherrill called on Biden to drop his 2024 reelection campaign and was the first to do so after a closed-door caucus meeting aimed at discussing concerns about Biden's place on top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nSherrill argued Biden needs to step aside because the stakes to defeat Trump are \"too high.\"\n\n\"I know that President Biden and his team have been true public servants and have put the country and the best interests of democracy first and foremost in their considerations,\" Sherrill said in a statement. \"And because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\"\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-WA)\n\nSmith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, on July 8 said Biden should go and that his debate performance was \"alarming to watch.\"\n\n\"The American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as president,\" Smith said on Monday.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley (D-IL)\n\nQuigley called on Biden to exit the race on July 5.\n\n\"Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude,\" Quigley told MSNBC. \"The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.\"\n\nRep. Angie Craig (D-MN)\n\nCraig on July 6 called for Biden's withdrawal and was the first to do so from a battleground district.\n\n\"Given what I saw and heard from the president during last week's debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the president himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,\" Craig said in a statement. \"That's why I respectfully call on President Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee for a second term as president and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.\"\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-MA)\n\nMoulton became the third sitting House Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw July 4, arguing the president should step aside to allow someone else to run against Trump.\n\n\"President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our Founding Father George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Trump,\" Moulton told Boston-area radio station WBUR on Thursday.\n\nJust the day before, Moulton said his party should consider \"all viable options\" to replace Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ)\n\nThe ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, Grijalva on July 3 became the second sitting member of Congress to call for Biden to drop out.\n\n\"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,\" he told The New York Times. \"What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat -- and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\"\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX)\n\nOn July 2, Doggett became the first sitting member of Congress to say Biden should withdraw from the race. The longtime House Democrat praised the president but said he \"failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies.\"\n\n\"Recognizing that unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\" Doggett said in a statement. \"I respectfully call on him to do so.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nRyan, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, wrote in a July 2 op-ed that Harris should replace Biden as the party's nominee after a \"deeply troubling\" debate performance.\n\n\"It isn't just about a 90-minute debate and a terrible performance,\" Ryan wrote. \"This election needs to be about generational change -- something about which I have been shouting for more than a year now.\"\n\nNew York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado\n\nDelgado, who is also a former House Democrat, called for Biden to suspend his candidacy as the Democratic nominee on July 10.\n\nDelgado praised Biden's record in a post to X but said he joins \"millions of Americans\" who are expressing concerns about Biden's ability to run a successful campaign against Trump.\n\n\"He can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign and making room for a new leader,\" Delgado said.\n\n\"I believe we should move forward with a nominee capable of re-invigorating and re-energizing Americans who are determined to protect our democracy, and who want to do so with a candidate they believe can win,\" Delgado continued.\n\nObama HUD Secretary Julian Castro\n\nCastro, who was also a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and has been critical of Biden in the past, said it was time for someone else to take the reins.\n\n\"I believe that there are stronger options out there for Democrats,\" Castro said July 2 on MSNBC. \"We have a stable of folks who could do a better job, including Vice President [Kamala] Harris. It's too risky to let Donald Trump walk into this in November.\"\n\nColorado congressional candidate Adam Frisch\n\nFrisch, who nearly unseated Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) in 2022 and is running for the open seat in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, on July 2 called on Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\n\"It has been clear to me for some time, and the debate only reinforced it -- neither candidate should be running for president,\" Frisch said in a video statement. \"We deserve better. President Biden should do what's best for the country and withdraw from the race. I thank President Biden for his years of service, but the path ahead requires a new generation of leadership to take our country forward.\"\n\nPresidential candidate Marianne Williamson\n\nWilliamson said July 2 that Biden should be replaced.\n\n\"President Biden deserves our respect, our compassion, and our gratitude,\" Williamson said in a video statement. \"The debate last week, however, made clear that the time is now for another Democratic candidate to take his place on the November ballot.\n\n\"Today, I throw my hat in the ring,\" she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFormer 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang\n\nYang, who left the Democratic Party in 2021 to become an independent, endorsed Biden's Democratic primary challenger this cycle, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN). Yang was among the first prominent voices after Biden's debate to say he should drop out on June 27.\n\n\"Guys, the Dems should nominate someone else - before it's too late,\" Yang posted on X.

Jared Huffman, D-Calif., Marc Veasey, D-Texas, Chuy Garcia, D-Illinois and Marc Pocan, D-Wisc., urged Biden to \"pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders.\"\n\n\"Mr. President, with great admiration for you personally, sincere respect for your decades of public service and patriotic leadership, and deep appreciation for everything we have accomplished together during your presidency, it is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" the lawmakers wrote.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy, protect our alliances and the rules-based international order, and continue building on the strong foundation you have established over the past four years,\" they said.\n\n\"At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign. These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change. We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nIn separate statements, Reps. Greg Landsman of Ohio and Zoe Lofgren of California also called on Biden to withdraw.\n\n\"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case. It is time for President Biden to step aside and allow us to nominate a new leader who can reliably and consistently make the case against Donald Trump and make the case for the future of America,\" Landsman said in a statement.\n\nLofgren, in a letter sent to Biden Thursday night, said: \"As I am aware that you have been provided data indicating that you in all likelihood will lose the race for President, I will not go through it again. Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot. It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our Party's nomination to allow another Democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.\"\n\nSolange Reyner \u2709 Solange Reyner is a writer and editor for Newsmax.

Marc Veasey on Friday became the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) to call for President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 election to allow another Democrat to run against Donald Trump.\n\nPolitico reported that Veasey, who represents Texas' 33rd Congressional District, was among four more Democrats formally making those calls in a letter sent to Biden addressing concerns about the president's \"fitness\" to be the party's nominee at its convention next month.\n\nThe CBC remains among those Democrats staunchly defending Biden's candidacy amid weeks of scrutiny following the president's unfortunate performance debating Trump last month. But Veasey's inclusion in a growing group of Democrats calling for Biden to step aside could mean others in the influential and powerful group of Black Congressmen and women are soon to follow.\n\nThe other three Democrats with Veasey include Illinois Rep. Chuy Garcia, who similarly broke from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to become the first member of that group to publicly call for Biden to drop out.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign. These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change,\" the letter, also signed by California Rep. Jared Huffman and Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan, said in part before adding later: \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nThe letter called for Vice President Harris to be considered as Biden's replacement among a \"bench of young leaders.\"\n\nThe letter comes days after Biden was in Las Vegas this week specifically courting Black and Latino voters at the NAACP Convention and the UnidosUS, the latter for which he was forced to cancel a speech after being diagnosed with Covid.\n\nJust last week, the CBC held a call with Biden to express their confidence with him being the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"None of the members who attended the virtual meeting expressed any doubts to the president about his electability or said he should step aside,\" the New York Times reported.\n\nAlso on Monday, CBC Chair and Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford said in a statement that \"Biden is the nominee.\"\n\nThat came one day after House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hosted a similar call with fellow House Democrats to help convince them to keep supporting Biden's candidacy. Jeffries said at the time that he \"has not changed\" his opinion about Biden's candidacy.\n\nHowever, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Jeffries has privately warned Biden that his candidacy could doom Democrats.\n\nThe whirlwind of developments took another turn Friday after NBC News reported that Biden's family has begun discussing a strategy for him to exit the race, suggesting it's just a matter of time before he drops out.\n\nIf and when that happens, it could risk alienating and undermining the Black voters who are credited with securing Biden's election in 2020 and voting for him to be the Democratic nominee in primary elections this year.\n\n\"To the majority of Black Voters, the Biden-Harris ticket has delivered on enough of those promises to stand with this ticket today,\" Cliff Albright and LaTosha Brown, co-founders of Black Voters Matter, and April England-Albright, National Legal Director of Black Voters Matter, said in a statement this week. \"In spite of this, the recent nervous cry for Biden to step aside -- led largely by white congresspeople, pundits, and donors -- threatens to mute and overlook the voices of Black Voters. Such a step by the Democratic Party would not only impact the enthusiasm of Black Voters in this year's general election, but it would impact Black turnout for decades to come while deepening the widespread belief that the Democratic Party takes our voters for granted.\"\n\nA new poll of voters in seven swing states found that a \"qualified Democratic candidate younger than Biden\" leads Trump by more than even percentage points.\n\nBroken down along racial lines, the poll also found that a \"majority of white (54%) and Hispanic (55%) voters think Biden should withdraw, while a majority of Black voters (65%) think he should not.\"\n\nThis is America.\n\nRNC Racism: Recapping All The Anti-Blackness At Republicans' Convention In Milwaukee\n\n'If You Don't Vote Donald Trump, You Ain't Black,' Michigan Rep.

The Democratic Party establishment wants Joe Biden to drop out and they're not pulling any punches to make it happen.\n\nLate on Thursday afternoon, before Donald Trump took the stage in Milwaukee, a rumor started floating around set off by Mark Halperin of Newsmax:\n\nAs it turns out, this story was pure fiction made up by some Democratic insider trying to write a narrative pushing Joe Biden out of the race. The detail seemed almost obviously false at face value, it's stunning that Halperin took the bait.\n\nThe resulting firestorm of \"Joe's dropping out by the weekend\" was a cascade of messages and articles that seemed to run rampant for several hours and even into Friday morning. That is until the Biden campaign started responding on multiple fronts, according to CNBC:\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign insisted Friday that he will remain at the top of the Democratic ticket, stressing in a new memo that Biden still has the support of voters, even as a growing number of Democratic lawmakers call on him to drop out.\n\n\"While voters consistently mention President Biden's age when contacted, our target voters -- both reengagement and true swing voters -- are still planning to vote for him, making it clear the debate has not hurt support among the voters who will decide this election,\" says the memo, first reported by NBC News.\n\n\"Joe Biden has made it more than clear: he's in this race and he's in it to win it. Moreover, he's the presumptive nominee, there is no plan for an alternative nominee,\" the memo said.\n\nDespite all the rumors that Obama has turned and the Clintons are sharpening their knives, Biden says it's all nonsense and he's not leaving.\n\nNonsense it may be, but the only thing unifying the Democratic Party right now is a loud public disdain for its presumptive nominee. Gone are the days when Republicans looked like a bunch of fighting elephants over the candidacy of Donald Trump.\n\nBiden still appears unmoved by the onslaught to push him out of the race. If he holds on a few more weeks, it's a done deal. At this point, Democrats would have to employ the 25th Amendment or try a coup at the convention by having Super Delegates pick someone else. Would they dare launch into such a public and vile civil war on the national stage?\n\nSo far, the full-court press is still happening, according to Politico, and likely not slowing down:\n\nA new wave of Democrats has renewed the calls for President Joe Biden to drop out of the race on Friday.\n\nFour House Democrats, including two who hail from the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus -- groups that have strongly backed Biden -- released a joint statement calling on Biden to step aside Friday morning.\n\nShortly after, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) also called on Biden to pass the torch, becoming the third senator to do so. He had previously expressed concerns over Biden but had not explicitly called on him to drop out.\n\nReps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Marc Veasey (D-Texas), Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) said in their statement that the party has a \"bench of young leaders,\" naming Vice President Kamala Harris specifically. Veasey is a member of the Biden-loyal Black Caucus and Garcia is part of the Hispanic Caucus, whose political PAC endorsed Biden Friday.\n\nAccording to famed election observer and predictor, Allan Lichtman, Democrats are committing political suicide regardless of how this shakes out:\n\nIf they keep Biden, they're likely to lose. If they replace Biden, they're still likely to lose. The environment today is a testament to Trump's strength but also to how badly the Biden administration has managed the country and how badly the Democratic Party has managed its own 2024 primary campaign. The time to force Joe Biden out was in January, not weeks before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nHeading into the weekend, it's anyone's guess as to what happens.\n\nGiven Biden's entrenched nature, I'd put a wager that 90% chance he stays in and maybe 10% that by Monday, he's out. Anyone who says they truly know what's going on inside the White House probably doesn't.", "source": {"uri": "uspresidentialelectionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Election Central"},

Rep. Chuy Garcia (D-IL) belongs to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) serves as a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA), who also joined the letter, is a progressive leader in the lower chamber.\n\n\"It is now time for you to pass the torch to a new generation of Democratic leaders,\" the Democrats wrote. Veasey's words come after a fellow Texas colleague, Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX), became the first House Democrat to ask Biden to step down on July 2.\n\nThe lawmakers urged Biden to relinquish his grasp on a second term. \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House,\" they wrote in a statement.\n\nComing from the mouths of black, Hispanic, and progressive leaders, all essential to pulling off a Democratic victory this November, the lawmakers' words sound a chilling warning for the Biden campaign.\n\nTheir decision to go public with their call marks a shift in the Democratic Party's strategy to replace the top of their ticket. One week ago, the Congressional Black Caucus held a private call with the president as Biden attempted to assuage concerns that he will lose the election this November.\n\n\"I need you,\" Biden told the minority group. Veasey's open action to pave his path apart from the Biden camp indicates a widening gap between the White House and minority groups. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC), an influential African American leader in the lower chamber who has maintained his staunch support for the Biden candidacy, also said he would \"absolutely\" support Vice President Kamala Harris as the nominee if the president stepped aside.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nWhile Veasey has become the first African American to break from his caucus, Garcia is the second member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who has asked Biden to step down. After the president held a virtual call with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus last week, Rep.

Marc Veasey calls for Biden to step aside", "body": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, and three other congressional Democrats called on President Joe Biden to \"pass the torch\" and step aside as his party's nominee.\n\nFellow Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman of California, Chuy Garcia of Illinois and Mark Pocan joined Veasey in a joint statement Friday morning. Veasey is now the second Democrat from Texas to call on Biden to withdraw, after Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the statement reads. \"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do at this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House.\"\n\nIn their statement, the members mention a \"deep and talented bench of younger leaders, led by Vice President Kamala Harris,\" but stop short of explicitly endorsing Harris as Biden's replacement.\n\nVeasey is notably the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to make this call publicly. Other members of the caucus, including Reps. Jasmine Crockett of Dallas and Al Green of Houston, have been among Biden's most steadfast supporters.\n\nDoggett was the first member of Congress to come out publicly against Biden. Roughly two dozen other House Democrats and three U.S. Senators have issued similar public statements in the two weeks since the president's disastrous debate in June.\n\nVeasey's statement came amid a particularly turbulent period of the race, just a day after the Republican National Convention adjourned and a week out from an attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, who accepted the nomination on Friday. Democrats have grown increasingly worried as Biden continues to slip in polls, while the attempt on Trump's life has locked in further support for the Republican this November.\n\nVeasey, a moderate who has served more than a decade in Congress, had previously been one of the few Texas Democrats to not take an open position on Biden's candidacy, instead warning other members to \"chill a little bit\" immediately after the debate. He later told reporters that representatives from battleground districts should feel free to come out against Biden if it would help them get reelected.\n\n\"What I said this morning and expressed to my colleagues, particularly from members on the front line, is that I think they need to do whatever it is they need to do in order to come back and be reelected and so if they need to, you know, distance themselves, then that's what they need to do,\" Veasey said a week after the debate.\n\nAll four Democrats in Friday's statement, however, come from safe Democratic seats. Veasey won reelection in 2022 with 72% of the vote.\n\nVeasey's comments mean just three Democrats from Texas have yet to take a public position: Reps. Henry Cuellar of Laredo, Joaquin Castro of San Antonio and Colin Allredof Dallas punted on the question as he focuses on a tough race against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Eight other Democrats from Texas have made public comments supportive of Biden.\n\nThe Texas Tribune answering reader questions about 2024 elections.

Gwen Moore's office has said the Milwaukee Democrat supports Biden's reelection bid but did not respond to questions about whether she has concerns about his viability.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin said she conveyed constituent concerns to the White House but has declined to say whether Biden should remain on the ticket as she has avoided talk of the president.\n\nBut Rep. Mark Pocan on Friday said he's seen enough. The Madison Democrat joined three other members Friday in calling for Biden to drop out, saying concerns about his ability to lead the ticket \"are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign.\" He became the first Wisconsin Democrat to publicly say Biden should step aside.\n\nFellow Democratic U.S. Reps. Jared Huffman of California, Marc Veasey of Texas and Chuy Garcia of Illinois joined Pocan in the public message to the president.\n\n\"We must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the Democrats wrote. \"These perceptions may not be fair, but they have hardened in the aftermath of last month's debate and are now unlikely to change.\"\n\nThe Democratic anxiety is hitting a high note just as Republicans concluded their presidential nominating convention in Milwaukee on Thursday. Republicans sought to present a unified front of support for Trump throughout the last week following the failed assassination attempt against the former president and as their counterparts battle internally over the future of their own presumptive nominee.\n\nBiden, who announced Wednesday he tested positive for COVID, has seen a growing number of Democrats call on him to withdraw in recent days, despite Biden's public defiance. Top party leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi have privately suggested Biden drop out, according to media reports. The party's convention is scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Chicago.\n\nAnd recent polling shows Biden losing more ground to Trump in key battleground states.\n\nIn Wisconsin, top Democratic officials have refrained from publicly calling on Biden to drop out. But they haven't hidden voters' uneasiness following Biden's disastrous debate performance last month.\n\nDemocratic Party of Wisconsin Chairman Ben Wikler has heard the concerns. The current debate around Biden's age and viability, he suggested, has made it more difficult to refocus the race on a debate over policy differences.\n\n\"There's been a kind of boiling conversation since the debate,\" Wikler said of party concerns. \"And, at the same time, there's total clarity on how much better Biden is than Trump and on the effectiveness of Biden's message.\"\n\nWikler declined to say whether he thinks Biden should or would remain the nominee but said he would \"fight for the Biden-Harris ticket all the way though.\" And he brushed aside questions about whether Biden stepping aside would allow for more policy debate.\n\n\"I have a deep level of certainty that in September and October, we're going to be talking about the stakes in the election,\" Wikler said.\n\nPocan, the congressman from Madison, has shown signs of worry about Biden's abilities in recent days.\n\nHe told the Journal Sentinel that Democrats in his district are concerned about what a \"Trump presidency with an agenda like Project 2025 would mean for real people,\" referring to a conservative think tank's controversial blueprint for a future Republican administration. But he also acknowledged Democratic worries over Biden.\n\n\"I'm hearing from people,\" Pocan said on Thursday. \"If I told you there was a two-hour period of any day this week that someone didn't reach out to me personally, much less reach out to my office, I would be lying.\"\n\n\"Mainly it's just an overall nervousness,\" he said. \"I think they're just concerned that we can beat Donald Trump, and they're concerned right now whether Joe Biden can or not.\"\n\n\"It's everything from what they saw in the debate to looking at some polls,\" he added. \"I absolutely understand that concern.\"\n\nOne Wisconsin Democratic strategist, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak freely, put it more bluntly:\n\n\"It is very hard to see any path for Joe Biden to win the state of Wisconsin today,\" the strategist said. \"And it's becoming such that the weakness of his candidacy is undermining other Democrats on the ballot.\"\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have frequently repeated one word at the Republican National Convention since Trump was grazed by a bullet during a failed assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last Saturday: unity.\n\nFormer South Carolina Nikki Haley, once among Trump's top primary opponents and a top critic, endorsed him on stage in Milwaukee this week.\n\nAnd, more locally, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos arrived in Milwaukee and told CBS58 that Trump is \"the best man for the job\" this November despite once calling Trump's candidacy a \"suicide mission.\"\n\nMore: At the RNC, convention-goers see the hand of God in Trump's survival\n\nWisconsin Republicans throughout the past week echoed the new united tone Trump sought to cast over the convention.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson suggested the Trump rally shooting \"unified us,\" though he forgot to mention that in his convention speech earlier in the week.\n\nAnd Republican Party of Wisconsin Chairman Brian Schimming at breakfasts each morning with Wisconsin Republicans painted Democrats as a party in chaos.\n\n\"The plain truth of the matter here is that Democrats are a party in disarray,\" he said at the start of the convention. \"They're a party in panic right now.\"\n\n\"By contrast,\" Schimming said, \"the Republicans are in Milwaukee today unified behind Donald Trump.\"\n\nIt's a tone Democrats have sensed, too.\n\n\"I think if you can't have a unified convention after we had this assassination attempt, you'd really have a bunch more serious problems,\" Pocan said. \"I'm not surprised at all they're in the place they're currently in.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he added, \"in two weeks, we'll see -- three weeks -- whether or not they're still in that position.\"", "source": {"uri": "greenbaypressgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Green Bay Press-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "green_bay_press_gazette@greenbaypressgazette.com", "name": "Green Bay Press-Gazette", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Wisconsin", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Zoe Lofgren (D-CA)\n\nThe close ally to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), the former speaker, became the 30th sitting Democrat on July 19.\n\n\"Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot,\" Lofgren wrote in a letter to Biden. \"It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our party's nomination to allow another Democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.\"\n\nRep. Greg Landsman (D-OH)\n\nLandsman became the 29th Democrat on July 19.\n\n\"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM)\n\nHeinrich, up for reelection but in a safe seat, on July 19 became the latest Democrat to urge Biden to \"pass the torch\" to another candidate. He marked the third Senate Democrat and the 28th sitting Democrat overall to take such a stance.\n\n\"While the decision to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is in the best interests of our country for him to step aside,\" Heinrich said in a statement. \"By passing the torch, he would secure his legacy as one of our nation's greatest leaders and allow us to unite behind a candidate who can best defeat Donald Trump and safeguard the future of our democracy.\"\n\nReps. Jared Huffman (D-CA), Marc Veasey (D-TX), Chuy Garcia (D-IL), and Mark Pocan (D-WI)\n\nIn a joint statement on July 19, the quartet said \"widespread public concerns\" about Biden's ability to beat Trump \"may not be fair\" but have nonetheless \"hardened\" in the past weeks of fallout. Veasey is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, where Biden has retained broad support -- until now. Pocan is chair emeritus of the Progressive Caucus.\n\nThe four members became the 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th current Congress members to call for Biden's withdrawal.\n\n\"We believe the most responsible and patriotic thing you can do in this moment is to step aside as our nominee while continuing to lead our party from the White House,\" the lawmakers said.\n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-IL)\n\nCasten was the 23rd sitting Democrat to say Biden should leave the race.\n\n\"It is with a heavy heart and much personal reflection that I am therefore calling on Joe Biden to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he wrote in a Chicago Tribune op-ed. \"To manage an exit with all the dignity and decency that has guided his half-century of public service. To cement his legacy as the president who saved our democracy in 2020 and handed it off to trusted hands in 2024 who could carry his legacy forward.\"\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-MT)\n\nTester, up for reelection, is one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats this election cycle and represents a state Trump carried by double digits. He became the second Democrat in the Senate and the 22nd Democrat in Congress to do so.\n\n\"I have worked with President Biden when it has made Montana stronger, and I've never been afraid to stand up to him when he is wrong,\" Tester said in a statement July 18. \"And while I appreciate his commitment to public service and our country, I believe President Biden should not seek re-election to another term.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA)\n\nA Senate candidate for the seat held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Schiff on July 17 said that \"while the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden's alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch.\"\n\nA high-profile Democrat who was an impeachment manager against Trump, Schiff is a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nRep. Mike Levin (D-CA)\n\nLevin said in a July 12 statement: \"The time has come for President Biden to pass the torch.\"\n\n\"Making this statement is not easy,\" he continued. \"I have deep respect for President Biden's five plus decades of public service and incredible appreciation for the work we've done together these last three and a half years.\"\n\nRep. Brittany Pettersen (D-CO)\n\nPettersen urged Biden to \"pass the torch\" in a statement issued July 12, the day after Biden's NATO press conference.\n\n\"Joe Biden saved our country once, and I'm joining the growing number of people in my district and across the country to ask him to do it again,\" Pettersen wrote. \"Please pass the torch to one of our many capable Democratic leaders, so we have the best chance to defeat Donald Trump, who is the greatest threat to the foundation of this country that we have ever faced.\"\n\nRep. Eric Sorensen (D-IL)\n\nSorenson, a front-line Democrat, said July 11 he is \"hopeful\" that Biden will step aside and put county over party \"again.\"\n\n\"It is more important than ever that our neighbors have a candidate for president who will communicate a positive vision for every person in this country. Someone who can demonstrate the strength and wisdom needed to lead us through the worst storms,\" Sorenson said in a statement on X after Biden's press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C.\n\nSorenson was the 17th Democratic lawmaker to ask Biden to suspend his bid for the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nRep. Scott Peters (D-CA)\n\nPeters called on Biden to withdraw July 11 shortly after the president wrapped up an almost hourlong Q&A session with reporters.\n\n\"Today I ask President Biden to withdraw from the presidential campaign,\" Peters wrote in a statement obtained by Politico. \"The stakes are high, and we are on a losing course.\"\n\nPeters is the 16th Democratic lawmaker to call on Biden to suspend his reelection campaign.\n\nRep. Jim Himes (D-CT)\n\nHimes called on Biden to exit the race just minutes after the president concluded his press conference at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C., on July 11.\n\nHimes became the 15th sitting Democratic lawmaker to call on Biden to withdraw ahead of the convention in August.\n\n\"Joe Biden's record of public service is unrivaled. His accomplishments are immense. His legacy as a great president is secure,\" Himes wrote on X. \"He must not risk that legacy, those accomplishments, and American democracy to soldier on in the face of the horrors promised by Donald Trump.\"\n\nRep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA)\n\nPerez is a co-chair of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and one of few Democrats representing a district Trump won in 2020.\n\nOn July 11, she said in a statement: \"I doubt the president's judgment about his health, his fitness to do the job, and whether he is the one making important decisions about our country.\"\n\nShe added: \"Americans deserve to feel their president is fit enough to do the job ... The president should do what he knows is right for the country.\"\n\nRep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ)\n\nAhead of a press conference from Biden on July 11, Stanton issued a statement calling on Biden to step aside because the \"Democratic Party must have a nominee who can effectively make the case against Trump, and have the confidence of the American people to handle the rigors of the hardest job on the planet for the next four years.\"\n\nStanton continued, \"For the sake of American democracy, and to continue to make progress on our shared priorities, I believe it is time for the President to step aside as our nominee.\"\n\nRep. Ed Case (D-HI)\n\nCase joined the chorus of Democrats calling on Biden to step aside July 11, telling Punchbowl News his \"guidepost is what is the best way forward for our country\" and that he does not \"believe President Biden should continue his candidacy for re-election as President.\"\n\nRep. Brad Schneider (D-IL)\n\nSchneider, vice chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, called on Biden to suspend his reelection campaign and allow the party to select a new nominee.\n\n\"I love President Biden. I am forever grateful for his leadership and service to our nation,\" Schneider said in a statement July 11. \"The time has come, however, for President Biden to heroically pass the torch to a new generation of leadership to guide us to the future he has enabled and empowered us to pursue.\"\n\nThe New Democrat Coalition, the largest Democratic caucus in the House, is made up of 100 House Democrats, and Schneider speaks frequently with the most vulnerable members of the party.\n\nRep. Hillary Scholten (D-MI)\n\nScholten, a vulnerable Democrat, joined nine of her colleagues to call on Biden to withdraw from the race as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"For the good of our Democracy, I believe it is time for him to step aside from the presidential race and allow a new leader to step up,\" Scholten said in a statement posted July 11 on X.\n\nScholten is a part of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's 2024 Frontline Program, which seeks to help vulnerable Democrats keep their seats.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSen. Peter Welch (D-VT)\n\nWelch was the first Democratic senator to call on Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee on July 10.\n\nThe Vermont senator, in an op-ed in the Washington Post, asked Biden to step aside after \"the national conversation is focused on Biden's age and capacity.\"\n\n\"I, like folks across the country, am worried about November's election,\" Welch writes. \"The stakes could not be higher. We cannot unsee President Biden's disastrous debate performance. We cannot ignore or dismiss the valid questions raised since that night.\"\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR)\n\nBlumenauer was the ninth House Democrat as of July 10 to say Biden should exit the race.\n\n\"While this is a decision for the president and the first lady, I hope they will come to the conclusion that I and others have: President Biden should not be the Democratic presidential nominee,\" he said in a statement. \"It is a painful and difficult conclusion, but there is no question in my mind that we will all be better served if the president steps aside as the Democratic nominee and manages a transition under his terms.\"\n\nRep.\n\nPat Ryan\n\n(D-NY)\n\nRyan, the only vulnerable Democrat in New York, was the eighth House Democrat to call on President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race on July 10.\n\nRyan posted on X that Biden is \"no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump.\"\n\nRyan asserted that for the good of the country, Biden should step aside and \"deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.\"\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ)\n\nOn July 9, Sherrill called on Biden to drop his 2024 reelection campaign and was the first to do so after a closed-door caucus meeting aimed at discussing concerns about Biden's place on top of the Democratic ticket.\n\nSherrill argued Biden needs to step aside because the stakes to defeat Trump are \"too high.\"\n\n\"I know that President Biden and his team have been true public servants and have put the country and the best interests of democracy first and foremost in their considerations,\" Sherrill said in a statement. \"And because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\"\n\nRep. Adam Smith (D-WA)\n\nSmith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, on July 8 said Biden should go and that his debate performance was \"alarming to watch.\"\n\n\"The American people have made it clear they no longer see him as a credible candidate to serve four more years as president,\" Smith said on Monday.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley (D-IL)\n\nQuigley called on Biden to exit the race on July 5.\n\n\"Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude,\" Quigley told MSNBC. \"The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.\"\n\nRep. Angie Craig (D-MN)\n\nCraig on July 6 called for Biden's withdrawal and was the first to do so from a battleground district.\n\n\"Given what I saw and heard from the president during last week's debate in Atlanta, coupled with the lack of a forceful response from the president himself following that debate, I do not believe that the President can effectively campaign and win against Donald Trump,\" Craig said in a statement. \"That's why I respectfully call on President Biden to step aside as the Democratic nominee for a second term as president and allow for a new generation of leaders to step forward.\"\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-MA)\n\nMoulton became the third sitting House Democrat to call on Biden to withdraw July 4, arguing the president should step aside to allow someone else to run against Trump.\n\n\"President Biden has done enormous service to our country, but now is the time for him to follow in one of our Founding Father George Washington's footsteps and step aside to let new leaders rise up and run against Trump,\" Moulton told Boston-area radio station WBUR on Thursday.\n\nJust the day before, Moulton said his party should consider \"all viable options\" to replace Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nRep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-AZ)\n\nThe ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, Grijalva on July 3 became the second sitting member of Congress to call for Biden to drop out.\n\n\"If he's the candidate, I'm going to support him, but I think that this is an opportunity to look elsewhere,\" he told The New York Times. \"What he needs to do is shoulder the responsibility for keeping that seat -- and part of that responsibility is to get out of this race.\"\n\nRep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX)\n\nOn July 2, Doggett became the first sitting member of Congress to say Biden should withdraw from the race. The longtime House Democrat praised the president but said he \"failed to effectively defend his many accomplishments and expose Trump's many lies.\"\n\n\"Recognizing that unlike Trump, President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself, I am hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw,\" Doggett said in a statement. \"I respectfully call on him to do so.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nRyan, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, wrote in a July 2 op-ed that Harris should replace Biden as the party's nominee after a \"deeply troubling\" debate performance.\n\n\"It isn't just about a 90-minute debate and a terrible performance,\" Ryan wrote. \"This election needs to be about generational change -- something about which I have been shouting for more than a year now.\"\n\nNew York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado\n\nDelgado, who is also a former House Democrat, called for Biden to suspend his candidacy as the Democratic nominee on July 10.\n\nDelgado praised Biden's record in a post to X but said he joins \"millions of Americans\" who are expressing concerns about Biden's ability to run a successful campaign against Trump.\n\n\"He can add to his legacy, showing his strength and grace, by ending his campaign and making room for a new leader,\" Delgado said.\n\n\"I believe we should move forward with a nominee capable of re-invigorating and re-energizing Americans who are determined to protect our democracy, and who want to do so with a candidate they believe can win,\" Delgado continued.\n\nObama HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nCastro, who was also a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and has been critical of Biden in the past, said it was time for someone else to take the reins.\n\n\"I believe that there are stronger options out there for Democrats,\" Castro said July 2 on MSNBC. \"We have a stable of folks who could do a better job, including Vice President [Kamala] Harris. It's too risky to let Donald Trump walk into this in November.\"\n\nColorado congressional candidate Adam Frisch\n\nFrisch, who nearly unseated Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) in 2022 and is running for the open seat in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, on July 2 called on Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\n\"It has been clear to me for some time, and the debate only reinforced it -- neither candidate should be running for president,\" Frisch said in a video statement. \"We deserve better. President Biden should do what's best for the country and withdraw from the race. I thank President Biden for his years of service, but the path ahead requires a new generation of leadership to take our country forward.\"\n\nPresidential candidate Marianne Williamson\n\nWilliamson said July 2 that Biden should be replaced.\n\n\"President Biden deserves our respect, our compassion, and our gratitude,\" Williamson said in a video statement. \"The debate last week, however, made clear that the time is now for another Democratic candidate to take his place on the November ballot.\n\n\"Today, I throw my hat in the ring,\" she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nFormer 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang\n\nYang, who left the Democratic Party in 2021 to become an independent, endorsed Biden's Democratic primary challenger this cycle, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN). Yang was among the first prominent voices after Biden's debate to say he should drop out on June 27.\n\n\"Guys, the Dems should nominate someone else - before it's too late,\" Yang posted on X.

House Democrat Sean Casten also called on Biden to drop out on Friday morning.\n\nNew Mexico senator Martin Heinrich on Friday became the third Democratic member of the chamber to urge Biden to drop out, joining Jon Tester of Montana and Vermont's Peter Welch.\n\n\"This moment in our nation's history calls for a focus that is bigger than any one person,\" Henrich said, adding it was \"in the best interests of our country\" for Biden to end his campaign.\n\nBiden insisted on Friday he would remain in the race, saying in a statement he \"look[ed] forward to getting back on the campaign trail next week to continue exposing the threat of Donald Trump's Project 2025 agenda\".\n\nThe president has been isolating at his holiday home in Delaware since testing positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday.\n\nThe new wave of lawmakers calling for Biden to quit comes as Democratic party grandees such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as the megadonors crucial to funding his campaign, heap pressure on the president behind the scenes.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Thursday that donors and other senior party operatives believe Biden is very close to a decision to exit.\n\nThe latest interventions came a day after Trump formally accepted the Republican party's nomination for president, less than a week after he narrowly escaped assassination in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president has surged ahead of Biden in the polls despite his recent criminal convictions, building a lead across the crucial swing states that will decide November's vote.\n\nNearly 30 members of Congress have now said Biden needs to drop his re-election bid, a view shared privately by many more who have not yet gone public.\n\nHowever, some Democrats, including many progressives, have defended the president. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez used an Instagram livestream in the early hours of Friday to fiercely defend the president and accuse \"donors\" and \"elites\" of trying to cast aside the president and his vice-president, Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden's disastrous debate performance against Trump last month sparked panic in the Democratic party over his age and fitness for office.

Together, we will win.\"\n\nThe message appeared to be a rebuke to a growing number of rank-and-file Democrats who have said publicly they would like to see him step aside in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris or another Democrat at the top of the party's presidential ticket.\n\nSpeculation had risen ahead of the weekend that Biden may be reconsidering his decision to stay in the race. Axios reported several unspecified \"top Democrats\" believed the pressure from within the party to step aside would keep rising and persuade Biden \"as soon as this weekend\" to quit.\n\nThat idea was quickly and publicly rejected by the White House.\n\n\"Wrong. Keep the faith,\" posted White House spokesperson Andrew Bates on social media early Friday in response to a story that Biden's family had discussed an exit strategy for him. Bates had similarly described another account of exit preparations as \"fan fiction.\"\n\nStill, despite the Biden camp's public steadfastness, defections continued to grow to around 30 Democrats on Capitol Hill. Friday morning saw one of the most significant yet in Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), a 15-term congresswoman who was one of Trump's impeachment trial managers and the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Space, Science and Technology Committee.\n\n\"As I am aware that you have been provided data indicating that you in all likelihood will lose the race for President, I will not go through it again,\" Lofgren said in a public letter to Biden.\n\n\"Simply put, your candidacy is on a trajectory to lose the White House and potentially impact crucial House and Senate races down ballot. It is for these reasons that I urge you to step aside from our Party's nomination to allow another Democratic candidate to compete against and beat Donald Trump in the November election.\"\n\nAs one of the longest-serving Democrats in the House and an ally of former speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Lofgren has the respect of many members of the House Democratic caucus and could be influential in convincing others to publicly join her call.\n\nThere was already a small cavalcade of public defections from Biden on Friday morning. Reps. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), Chuy Garc\u00eda (D-Ill.), Marc Veasey (D-Texas) and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) issued a joint statement for Biden to step aside that said he had \"lifted up, empowered, and prepared\" younger Democratic leaders like Harris for this moment.\n\nReps. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) and Sean Casten (D-Ill.) each issued their own statements Friday calling for Biden to abandon his reelection bid. \"There is too much on the line, and we have to be able to make that case to the American people about the change we need and the country we all deserve,\" Landsman wrote.\n\nAnd on Thursday, The New York Times reported that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), another impeachment manager and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, had written a letter to Biden earlier in the month to try to persuade him to drop out, comparing him to an effective but tired pitcher late in a tight baseball game.\n\n\"There is no shame in taking a well-deserved bow to the overflowing appreciation of the crowd when your arm is tired out, and there is real danger for the team in ignoring the statistics,\" he wrote.\n\nBiden also received more bad news in the form of an estimate from noted polling expert Nate Silver. In his newsletter, Silver said Biden was now polling 4 points behind Trump and had hit a new low in Silver's election forecast model, with only a 26% chance of winning the Electoral College vote.\n\nBut even that estimate may be slightly optimistic, according to Silver.\n\n\"However, the model is designed to be cautious around party conventions: it's shaving a little bit off Trump's numbers and also hedging toward its pre-convention forecast. If Trump sustains these numbers, the forecast will continue to get worse for Biden,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_nicholson@yahoo.com", "name": "Jonathan Nicholson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Lofgren", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoe Lofgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bates_College", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bates College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_trial_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First impeachment trial of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuy_Garc\u00eda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuy Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Landsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Landsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Casten", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Casten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Huffman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Huffman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pocan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Pocan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Raskin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Raskin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nate Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_huffington_post_584/4ce3de000b057433791c67b4b2d46540", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747470", "eventUri": "eng-9747470", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Tom Brenner/Reuters\n\nMORE: Fact-checking Donald Trump's RNC speech on immigration, the economy, world affairs and more\n\nBiden has been sidelined since Wednesday when he was diagnosed with COVID-19 moments before delivering remarks in Las Vegas at the UnidosUS conference, the largest Latino civil rights group in the country. He abruptly cut his trip short and flew to his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\nBoarding Air Force One Wednesday, Biden struggled to walk up the shorter stairs that pull out from under the plane. And after arriving in Dover, he again struggled deplaning, and Secret Service appeared to physically help him into the waiting SUV.\n\nBut Biden's determination to return to the campaign trail appears to be because his team is reenergized by Trump's speech.\n\n\"He's playing the greatest hits from 2016 - Trump has not changed, he has not moderated, he has gotten worse,\" a Biden adviser said Thursday night. \"And he is making no appeal to moderates.\"\n\nThe president said Trump laid out a \"dark vision\" for America's future and that \"Together, as a party and as a country, we can and will defeat him at the ballot box.\"\n\nBut his party is not together. Democrats remain split on whether Biden can beat Trump in November and on Friday at least 10 Democrats joined the chorus calling on Biden to resign, including Texas Rep. Marc Veasey, the first member from the influential Congressional Black Caucus to do so.\n\nUS former President and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raises a fist as he arrives for the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wis., on July 17, 2024.

Jared Huffman, Chuy Garcia, and Mark Pocan.\n\n\"We must defeat Donald Trump to save our democracy... At this point, however, we must face the reality that widespread public concerns about your age and fitness are jeopardizing what should be a winning campaign,\" the four congressmen added.\n\nBrown, in a close reelection fight, said in a statement that many Ohioans had contacted him.\n\n\"Over the last few weeks, I've heard from Ohioans on important issues, such as how to continue to grow jobs in our state, give law enforcement the resources to crack down on fentanyl, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, and prevent the ongoing efforts to impose a national abortion ban. These are the issues Ohioans care about and it is my job to keep fighting for them,\" he said.\n\n\"I agree with the many Ohioans who have reached out to me. At this critical time, our full attention must return to these important issues. I think the President should end his campaign,\" he said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman, who represents a battleground Ohio district, both also pointed to Trump and the risk to \"democracy\" for reasons Biden should exit.\n\n\"There is too much on the line, and we have to be able to make that case to the American people about the change we need and the country we all deserve,\" Landsman wrote in his statement. \"After weeks of consideration and hundreds of conversations with constituents, I have come to the conclusion that Joe Biden is no longer the best person to make that case.\"\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren of California, a close ally of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a letter addressed to the president on Thursday, but was first reported on Friday, made a similar argument doubting Biden can effectively run a winning campaign.\n\n\"I want to be clear that should you formally become the Democratic nominee for President I will do everything I can to promote your candidacy and to work for your success,\" Lofgren wrote in the letter obtained by ABC News. \"Unfortunately, I greatly doubt that the outcome will be positive, and our country will pay a dreadful price for that.\"\n\nBiden campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon admitted on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday that they have seen Biden's support slip.\n\n\"I'm not here to say that this hasn't been a tough several weeks for the campaign,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"There's no doubt that it has been, and we've definitely seen some slippage in support, but it has been a small movement, and you know this, the reason is because so much of this race is hardened already.\"\n\nIn what was a bruising day for the president, with the calls from congressional Democrats urging him to drop out swelling to 34 by ABC News's count, Biden did get critical support from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nThe group's political arm, BOLD PAC, on Friday endorsed the president, a week after his call with the group, saying he and Vice President Kamala Harris \"have delivered for the Latino community.\"\n\nAmid news of more congressional Democrats on Friday joining calls for Biden to step aside, his campaign said it recognizes that the \"urgency\" of beating Donald Trump has led some Democrats to publicly abandon their support of the president leading the ticket -- though they remain confident the party will unite by November.\n\n\"While the majority of the caucus and the diverse base of the party continues to stand with the President and his historic record of delivering for their communities, we're clear-eyed that the urgency and stakes of beating Donald Trump means others feel differently,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg said in a statement to ABC News.\n\n\"We all share the same goal: an America where everyone gets a fair shot and freedom and democracy are protected,\" Ehrenberg added. \"Unlike Republicans, we're a party that accepts - and even celebrates - differing opinions, but in the end, we will absolutely come together to beat Donald Trump this November.\"", "source": {"uri": "queondamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u00a1Que Onda Magazine!"}, "authors": [{"uri":

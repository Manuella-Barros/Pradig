The Braves haven't been 2.5 games back in the divisional standings since September 23rd, 2022, although they came back to win the NL East on the season's final day.\n\nThe recent struggles by Atlanta, who are only 4-6 in their last ten games, have resulted in some movements in the most recent MLB Power Rankings.\n\nMLB.com, putting out their update this morning, dropped Atlanta from 1st place down to 4th. Here's what writer Will Leitch said about Atlanta's movement:\n\nMax Fried, a SoCal native famous for doing well against the Dodgers, came into Sunday not having given up a run in his previous two starts. Unfortunately for him, the Dodgers are smoking right now. Fried wasn't a disaster against them -- he gave up four runs in seven innings -- but it wasn't enough. The Braves have been one of the best teams in baseball for several years now. But when you put them up against the Dodgers this weekend, Atlanta looked like the lesser team by a considerable amount.\n\nOn the six-game road trip to Seattle and Los Angeles, Atlanta batted .168/.218/.244 with 58 strikeouts and only eight extra-base hits. They stranded thirty-one runners on base and scored a total of fourteen runs, just barely over two runs a game.\n\nThat offensive futility was cited by Bleacher Report in their movement of Atlanta from #1 all the way down to #6 in their power rankings update on Monday morning.\n\nThe Braves had lost just one series all season heading into last week, but after getting swept by Shohei Ohtani and the Dodgers on Sunday they are now smack dab in the middle of their first real bad stretch of the year. The high-powered Atlanta offense managed just 14 runs over six games against the Mariners and Dodgers, so getting back on track at the plate will be the key to a quick turnaround.\n\n(Quick correction for BR's Joel Reuter: Atlanta hadn't lost a series entering last week. They're technically down 2-1 to New York in the early April series, but the April 10th rainout from that series is being made up on September 26th, so that series isn't officially decided yet and the Braves could still split.)\n\nHe's not wrong that the offense needs to figure some things out, though. Austin Riley and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr both hit homers over the weekend against LA, but they're still not producing where they need to be. Matt Olson, however, continues his struggles, with his batting average now down to .197. The trio all have more strikeouts than games played (32), with Olson at 35, Riley at 36, and Acu\u00f1a almost halfway (40) to last season's total of 84.\n\nAfter a day off on Monday, the Braves are back in action against the Boston Red Sox.

With a loaded roster that boasts a lineup featuring Ronald Acuna Jr., Austin Riley, and Matt Olson, among a rotation with Chris Sale, Max Fried, and Charlie Morton, how could they not be favorites for the Fall Classic? The Braves have hit a bit of a skid as of late, however.\n\nThe Braves began the season at an impressive 17-6. But once the calendar started creeping up on the month of May, the team has sputtered. The competition has gotten a lot better against Atlanta, where they faced division leaders that started with the Cleveland Guardians back on April 26, followed by a six-game west coast road trip to face the Los Angeles Dodgers and Seattle Mariners. In those three series, the Braves went 3-6. Before that, they had won 10 out of their last 11 games.\n\nNo longer are the Braves the leaders of the National League East, with that honor being bestowed on the Philadelphia Phillies now, who have a 2.5-game lead over their rivals. Even after a sweep by the Dodgers, who outscored the Braves 20-6 in their series, it's way too early to panic one week into the second month of the season. However, it's not too early for the Braves to be considering trades to help bolster their team.\n\nLet's now look at one early-season trade the Braves should consider.\n\nBraves need a left-handed reliever\n\nThe Braves haven't exactly liked what they've seen from a returning Tyler Matzek. The lefty reliever is coming off Tommy John surgery from 2022 but has yet to find his magical 2021 form that helped the Braves win the World Series that season. In 11 appearances this season for Atlanta, Matzek has ballooned his ERA up to 9.90, which is second-to-worst in all of MLB for lefty relievers. He's given up 11 runs, all earned, three home runs, three walks, striking out 10. Hitters facing Matzek have a .356 batting average, which is third worst for lefties in relief.\n\nOutside of Matzek, the Braves throw out there on a nightly basis AJ Minter, Dylan Lee, and Aaron Bummer to combat a majority of right-handers. Minter is obviously the stalwart of the group -- minus that bomb to Shohei Ohtani on Sunday -- and has been for a number of seasons for Atlanta as far as middle relief goes. But Bummer is still proving himself after 12 games and a 4.79 ERA. Meanwhile, Lee, who is coming off shoulder surgery last season, is just getting started for the Braves this season. However, in nine appearances thus far, he looks pretty much back to form.\n\nWhile the Braves may look for some short-term answers with some of their minor league arms to alleviate their bullpen problems, Alex Anthopoulos likely has his eyes on the potential reliever market, as he's already acquired one arm in the Los Angeles Angels right-hander Jimmy Herget. But it could be wise for Anthopoulos to look eastward at lefty Tim Hill.\n\nBraves need to make a trade for White Sox reliever Tim Hill\n\nIn case you don't know, the Chicago White Sox are one of the worst teams in all of baseball. If not for the Colorado Rockies, who tie them with an 8-26 record, they would be the worst. So, it's highly unlikely this team goes on a massive win streak and recovers. That puts them as automatic sellers at any time this season.\n\nThe Miami Marlins, the Braves' division rival, have already started off-loading their talent, and they are currently two games better than the White Sox. If Chicago wants to do the same, the Braves should at least inquire about lefty reliever Tim Hill, one of their better pieces in the bullpen.\n\nHill, who was released by the San Diego Padres over the winter, ending his four-year run there, has seven years of service in the majors, dating back to 2018. In 13 appearances this season, Hill is currently sporting a 3.38 ERA in 10.2 innings pitched. He's given up 14 hits, just four earned runs, no homers, and four walks.\n\nThe question, though, is what do you give up for Hill? The White Sox are in a massive rebuild it seems and will be looking for some players who will likely be able to contribute in the near future. Seeing as how the White Sox signed Hill to just a one-year deal for $1.8 million this offseason (per ESPN's Jeff Passan), that wouldn't give Chicago a ton of leverage.\n\nWould RHP Darius Vines, the club's 14th-ranked prospect, along with maybe anoter lesser arm or position player, be an option for Anthopoulos to consider trading to the Windy City? Vines has already been called up to the Braves' rotation this season to help out with Strider's absence. Don't expect guys like AJ Smith-Shawver or rookie Hurston Waldrep to be considered, at least not in this type of deal. Seeing as how seven out of the Braves' top 10 prospects are all pitchers, one of those arms is likely going to be asked about from Chicago.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news",

That was an outlier: Since 2013, that was the only series the Braves have won at Chavez Ravine. Their latest bout of misery in Southern California came this weekend, when their recent issues were exacerbated over a three-game sweep.\n\nIn the past decade, the Braves are 9-28 in Los Angeles, including the postseason. Much is made of the Braves' typical struggles out West, but that isn't really the case anymore. They've won four of the last five series in Arizona. They've won three of five series in San Francisco. They're 10-3 in San Diego since 2019.\n\nYes, they lost a series in Oakland last year. They lost a series in Seattle last week. But what happened this past weekend wasn't about cross-country travel. This team averaged 6.44 runs over the first 18 games of the season; it scored six total during the sweep, a perfect example of the team's recent frustrations.\n\nThe Braves haven't played to their lofty standard, scraping by with an underperforming offense because their pitching had excelled. The Dodgers' lineup, though, was a different animal compared to what Cleveland and Miami had during the Braves' past homestand.\n\n\"It's a really good, complete lineup,\" starter Max Fried said of the Dodgers. \"One through nine, they have people who can beat you. It's a really good one. You know you have to be on top of your game. I learned real quick that a couple pitches can hurt you.\"\n\nDodgers newcomer Shohei Ohtani, the biggest free-agent signing in baseball history (at least by financial and interest standards), tormented the Braves. He had the game-tying hit late in Friday's game. He homered Saturday. He homered twice in Sunday.\n\nOhtani went 8-for-12 with three homers, six RBIs and five runs scored in the series. The Braves will see the Dodgers again in September. They'll see the Dodgers again in some October, be it this one or sometime in the future. Ohtani is perhaps the world's best player, but they'll need to do something differently moving forward.\n\nThe Dodgers' other MVPs were mostly contained. Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman combined to go 5-for-25 with three RBIs and three runs scored. Ohtani might not go Superman every series, but the other two, especially Betts given he produced only one hit, could be more impactful.\n\n\"That top three is as good as it gets in baseball, three MVP candidates every year that you have to face 12 times over the course of a game,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"That's rough. It's a good club. It's deep, it's strong. It's a typical Dodger club.\"\n\nOn paper, the Braves have a lengthier lineup than the Dodgers. The team just isn't performing to its expectations. That starts with first baseman Matt Olson, who's hitting .197 with three homers.\n\nSnitker noted that Olson didn't start the 2023 season on fire, either, before hitting a franchise record 54 homers. But Olson was still hitting .244 with an .884 OPS at this point a year ago (he has a .676 OPS now). He reached three homers on April 5 last season, while he has that total on May 5 this year.\n\nBut Olson has one of the best hard-hit rates in MLB. He slammed a couple balls that just drifted foul or fell shy of the wall in Los Angeles. There are 130 games remaining, and the underlying numbers suggest Olson will be fine.\n\n\"He's just a click away,\" Snitker said.\n\nMaybe Olson and the offense find their form this week. Context: The Braves are still 20-12. The Phillies have been phenomenal - they lead the National League East by 2-1/2 games - but there's a lot of season remaining and the Braves are still arguably the most talented team in MLB.\n\nThis two-week stretch is agitating because expectations are so high. Everyone knows the team is capable of record-setting offense. But last year spoiled fans, in a way. The team never had an extended run of offensive woes.\n\n\"If you're lucky, it'll only happen once,\" Snitker said. \"But most of the time it'll happen more than that. That's why we play for six months.\"\n\nThe Braves host the Red Sox for two games this week before traveling to New York to face the Mets. The team will return home again May 13 for a six-game homestand against the Cubs and Padres.\n\nBoston and Chicago have winning records while the Mets and Padres are talented middling teams. These won't be easy opponents, but especially with eight of the next 11 at Truist Park, the Braves will have the chance to get back on track.\n\n\"I trust and have a lot of faith in this group that we'll right the ship,\" Fried said.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Boston's lineup combined for eight hits, six walks and got runners into scoring position in six out of nine innings.\n\nYet when it came time to get the big hit, the Red Sox collectively couldn't come through.\n\nBoston went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 13 men on base in Tuesday's 4-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves, a frustrating performance against one of the best teams in Major League Baseball. The Red Sox also wasted a solid start by starting pitcher Kutter Crawford, who held his own against one of the deepest and most relentless lineups in baseball.\n\n\"We had traffic all over the place and we didn't cash in,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said afterwards. \"In certain situations we have to be humble and take what they give us, advance the runner, put the ball in play, and we didn't do that.\"\n\nCrawford allowed just two runs over six innings, striking out six while walking two and allowing five hits. The right-hander's ERA for the season is now 1.75, and Crawford has posted a quality start in five of his eight outings, including each of the last four.\n\nThe one blemish on Crawford's line was a two-run home run by Jarred Kelenic, which was his first of the season and put the Braves up 2-0 in the third. The Red Sox had no shortage of baserunners, but the offense wasn't able to answer until the bottom of the sixth, when Braves starter Reynaldo Lopez abruptly lost his command.\n\nBoston drew three walks in the inning, including one with the bases loaded by Reese McGuire to cut the deficit to one. That marked the end of Lopez's night, and Ceddanne Rafaela welcomed reliever Aaron Bummer by bouncing a soft chopper right off the back of his left. Had the ball been fielded cleanly it could have been an inning-ending double play, but instead it wound up in no-man's land and Vaughn Grissom came in to tie the game.\n\nThat was the only hit the Red Sox could muster with men in scoring position all game, and beyond that the team couldn't capitalize any further.\n\nJarren Duran and Rafael Devers struck out with the bases loaded to end the threat, and from there the lineup kept wasting opportunities. The Red Sox caught a particularly unlucky break in the eighth, when Tyler O'Neill laced what looked like a go-ahead two-run double into left field, only for former Red Sox outfielder Adam Duvall to race in and make an incredible sliding catch to end the inning.\n\nThe Braves, meanwhile, didn't get nearly as much traffic but capitalized on their big opportunity in the bottom of the eighth. After Justin Slaten allowed a leadoff walk to Ozzie Albies, the Braves retook the lead on a Marcell Ozuna RBI single and added another run-scoring fielder's choice by Orlando Arcia, which could have been an inning-ending double play but instead made it 4-2 Atlanta.\n\nThat wound up being all the offense the Braves needed.\n\nJarren Duran continued his historic start in the loss, going 2 for 5 with a double and a triple. He now has six triples, eight doubles and nine stolen bases on the season, and the only other player in franchise history with six-plus triples and nine-plus stolen bases through 36 games is Hall of Famer Tris Speaker all the way back in 1913.\n\nGrissom went 1 for 4 with a run scored in his return to Atlanta, and Wilyer Abreu drew two walks and scored a run.\n\nWith the loss the Red Sox fall to 19-17 on the season. They'll look to salvage a two-game split Wednesday, with first pitch scheduled for 7:20 p.m.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors":

It's led to a lot of hand-wringing from within the fanbase and misguided \"the Braves are in trouble\" comments from national media.\n\nAnd let's call a spade a spade: Things aren't great for the Braves at the moment. Across that six-game road trip, Atlanta hitters batted .168/.218/.244 with 58 strikeouts and only eight extra-base hits. They stranded thirty-one runners on base and scored a total of fourteen runs, just barely over two runs a game.\n\nRonald Acu\u00f1a Jr. has forty strikeouts in just thirty-two games played this season. He's already surpassed last season's number of multi-strikeout games and his forty punchouts are almost half of last season's total of eighty-four. Matt Olson's batting just .197 and Austin Riley's hitting at a .237 clip.\n\nDespite all of these struggles, Atlanta's still the third-highest scoring team in runs per game, at 5.09. They're 20-12, the last team to hit double-digit losses on the season.\n\nThey're going to be fine.\n\nBecause every team struggles, and Atlanta is no exception to that.\n\nWe can all agree that the 2023 Atlanta Braves were one of the best offensive teams we've ever seen, right? They tied the all-time single-season homer record, launching 307 homers. They led baseball in almost every single offensive category, scoring an absurd 947 runs.\n\nBut they struggled for stretches, too. Speaking of bad road trips, remember that Toronto Blue Jays sweep in mid-May? The Braves got doubled up on runs, 14-7, and lost all three games. Remember heading out to Oakland Athletics and barely squeaking out one win in three tries?\n\nWhat about the six-game homestand in mid July against the Chicago White Sox and Arizona Diamondbacks, where you won the first game and the last game while getting outscored by seventeen runs in the middle three losses?\n\nThese things happen when you play 162 games. You're going to have those situations where you get the combo of facing a good opponent, having a rough few days, and having some bad luck.\n\nAnd I don't mean \"bad luck\" as in \"the ball took some weird bounces\". I mean those fluky things that happen in baseball - the things that even out over the course of 162 games but not over a three-game series or a six-game road trip. Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr getting picked off of second base right before Austin Riley hits his first home run in three weeks. Matt Olson getting thrown out trying to stretch a single into a double right before Marcell Ozuna homers.\n\nAre there things to figure out for this Braves team? There absolutely is...but these players are too good to not figure it out. This isn't going to continue for the entire season, no matter how likely it feels in the moment, right now, while you're living it.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsay_crosby@si.com", "name": "Lindsay Crosby", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Acu\u00f1a_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Olson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Olson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Ozuna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3186,h_1792,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx76k0ys08h51g54r0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He drove one to the warning track in his final at-bat and heard chants of \"MVP! MVP!\" from the crowd at Truist Park.\n\nOzuna shrugged off the adulation, which is a far cry from a year ago when he was struggling badly and his time in Atlanta appeared to be winding down.\n\n\"Even if you do great, you have to be on the same level,\" he said. \"Don't get comfortable.\"\n\nSale (5-1) pitched for the Red Sox from 2018-23 -- a tenure that began with a World Series championship but was largely marred by injuries before he was traded to Atlanta this past winter.\n\nIt was strange facing his former team, but he quickly settled in.\n\n\"I respect those guys. I love those guys,\" Sale said. \"But we're here to win.\"\n\nThe left-hander sure seems to have regained the form that made him one of baseball's most dominant starters. He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\n\"I went into the offseason on a mission,\" Sale said, \"I got after it. I knew I had to do it this year.\"\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come. On this date a year ago, he was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this year.\n\nMore from this section Seton Hall transfer Kadary Richmond commits to St. John's Former ballyhooed recruit Sam Huard transfers to Utah Report: Rams releasing veteran WR Ben Skowronek\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\n\"Austin beating that ball out is a huge play,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"That gives us four runs, which is pretty much the difference in the game.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home to open a three-game series Friday against Washington, with RHP Tanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) set to face Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (0-3, 6.45 ERA). RHP Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) takes the mound for the Braves on Friday to begin a weekend set at New York. The Mets will go with LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA).", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@reformer.com",

Rafaela's homer was 105.2 mph off the bat and was projected at 398 feet. The 23-year-old clearly possesses sufficient pop, but the approach needs work; he's swinging at everything and just not making hard contact consistently.

Ozuna's home run was a 373-foot shot at 104.3 mph off the bat. It was the Braves' only extra-base hit of the night.

The Braves have the second-best World Series odds but they enter on a three-game losing streak and the Red Sox haven't been pushovers -- especially with Kutter Crawford on the mound.\n\nSee why I like both Crawford and Atlanta pitcher Reynaldo Lopez with my Red Sox vs. Braves predictions and MLB picks for Tuesday, May 7.\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the Boston Red Sox have the best rotation in the majors. Today they're giving the ball to Kutter Crawford, who has pitched to a 1.56 ERA through seven starts while ranking in the Top 5th percentile in hard-hit rate.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves also have a red-hot pitcher on the hill in Reynaldo Lopez, who has a 1.50 ERA in five starts. Lopez struggled early in his career but after a couple of productive years as a reliever, he has earned another shot at being a starter and is making it count.\n\nWhile regression seems inevitable for both hurlers, their impressive expected ERA numbers (3.23 for Lopez and 2.93 for Crawford) indicate that any drop-off shouldn't be steep.\n\nThe Red Sox have been inconsistent at the dish and rank just 28th in expected batting average (.231) and 17th in expected slugging percentage (.392). Although the Braves have a scarier lineup, they're in the middle of a slump and have plated just 2.5 runs per game over their last eight contests. I'm backing the sizzling starters in this matchup and taking the Under 9.\n\nCrawford has fanned at least five batters in 11 of his last 12 starts going back to last season. The Braves are 18th in the majors in strikeout rate and are just 26th in that category over the last two weeks.\n\nVaughn Grissom made his Red Sox debut last Friday and he has gone 1-for-8 at the plate in two games. He actually played last season in Atlanta but was unable to a regular spot in the lineup and finished with a .347 slugging percentage in 23 games. Grissom is a bright prospect but hasn't shown enough in the majors for the Over 1.5 on his total bases to be priced at -165, especially with a red-hot starter like Lopez toeing the rubber.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Under is 14-4 in Boston's last 18 games while going 10-1-1 in Atlanta's previous 12 contests.

It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Red Sox-Braves prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nThe Red Sox look to continue their momentum on the road Wednesday night as they face the Braves again at Truist Park. Boston will need another strong pitching performance, to counter Atlanta's explosive offense. The Braves, with Chris Sale on the mound, look to continue their dominance at home. The Red Sox hope they can gain some ground in the AL East standings when Nick Pivetta and the Red Sox take on the Braves on Wednesday night.\n\nBraves fans, because Truist Park sizzles again Wednesday night as Atlanta faces the pesky Red Sox for game two! The Braves, boasting a dominant Chris Sale on the mound, aim to maintain their home-field advantage and continue their dominance at home. The Red Sox, however, are playing with surprising grit on the road. The Braves will look to take this series at home when they host the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox continue their road trip at Truist Park on Wednesday for a matchup against the Atlanta Braves. While the Braves boast the recently re-activated Chris Sale on the mound, the Red Sox could pull off the upset with Nick Pivetta on the hill and their bats continuing to sizzle.\n\nPivetta, a resurgent righty, has been a revelation for Boston this season. He throws a deceptive array of pitches, including a sinking fastball that induces ground balls and a sharp curveball that keeps hitters off balance. His recent performances showcase his ability to navigate lineups effectively, sporting a remarkable 1-1 record and a 0.82 ERA in two starts this season as he comes off the 15-Day IL.\n\nChris Sale, the former ace who returned from injury this season, remains a question mark for Atlanta. While his talent is undeniable, his command and stamina has been erratic at times for the Braves. The Red Sox, who faced Sale multiple times during his tenure with the team, could capitalize on any early rust.\n\nFurthermore, the Red Sox' offense seems to be finding its groove. Rob Refsnyder and Rafael Devers are leading the charge, and veterans like Tyler O'Neill and Garrett Cooper are showing signs of life. This offensive surge, coupled with Atlanta's potential vulnerability against Pivetta's pitching style, could create an opportunity for Boston to steal another win on the road.\n\nThe key for the Red Sox lies in capitalizing early against Sale and providing ample run support for Pivetta. They need to be aggressive at the plate and force the Braves to make moves out of their bullpen early.\n\nThis matchup presents a fascinating contrast: a resurgent Pivetta facing a returning Sale. While the storyline surrounding Sale's return is enticing, the Red Sox' current momentum and Pivetta's recent consistency give them a slight edge. If they can jump on Sale early and keep their bats hot, Boston can secure a surprising victory in Atlanta.\n\nWhy The Braves Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nTruist Park crackles with anticipation on Wednesday night as the Atlanta Braves continue their home stand against the Red Sox with Chris Sale on the mound against the pesky Boston Red Sox. While Nick Pivetta has been a pleasant surprise for Boston, Sale's call to the mound could be the key ingredient for an Atlanta victory.\n\nSale, a former Cy Young winner, brings a wealth of experience and an intimidating presence to the mound. His repertoire features a devastating fastball that can overpower hitters and a sharp slider that keeps them off balance. Although he has been inconsistent at times thus far this season, Sale's competitive drive and veteran leadership will undoubtedly energize the Braves' defense.\n\nOn the other side, Nick Pivetta, despite his recent success, is coming back from injury for this matchup. His 1-1 record and 0.82 ERA look great on paper, but he hasn't faced a lineup quite as potent as Atlanta's. The Braves hitters, led by Marcel Ozuna and Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., can exploit any mistakes Pivetta makes, especially early in the game.\n\nFurthermore, the Braves are a completely different team at home. The electric atmosphere at Truist Park can work wonders for a pitcher like Sale, feeding off his competitive spirit and potentially propelling him toward a dominant performance.\n\nWhile Pivetta has been a bright spot for the Red Sox, facing a motivated Chris Sale in his return and a hungry Braves lineup at home is a daunting task. The combination of Sale's experience, the Braves' offensive firepower, and the home-field advantage positions Atlanta for a convincing victory on Wednesday night. Look for the Braves to capitalize on Sale's dominance on the mound and their home-field energy to secure a win and extend their winning ways.\n\nFinal Red Sox-Braves Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be an exciting matchup between two teams full of young talent. The Atlanta Braves boast one of the more potent lineups in the majors and are going to Nick Pivetta a ton of problems, especially being his first start back after being on the 15-Day IL. It's up to Chris Sale to limit the damage on his side and if he can do so expect the Braves to pounce on Pivetta and get a much-needed home victory to cut into the Phillies lead atop of the NL East.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Acu\u00f1a_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Real Estate", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business_to_Business", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Business to Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Red-Sox-vs-Braves-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

It is time to continue our MLB odds series with a Red Sox-Braves prediction, pick, and how-to-watch.\n\nBoston (19-16) travels to Truist Park to face the red-hot Atlanta Braves. The Braves boast a potent offense and a lockdown bullpen, while the Red Sox look to bounce back after a recent slump. Pitching will be key in this matchup. This promises to be a battle as the first pitch flies Tuesday night!\n\nBraves (20-12) fans, Truist Park gets electric on Tuesday night as Atlanta welcomes the Boston Red Sox! The Braves, riding high on a winning streak, look to extend their dominance with their explosive offense and lights-out bullpen. The Red Sox, hungry to turn things around, counter with a dangerous lineup but face a tough pitching matchup. This clash promises fireworks, pitching versus power. Buckle up for a battle under the Atlanta lights!\n\nTuesday night's interleague matchup between the Boston Red Sox and Atlanta Braves at Truist Park is an intriguing battle. While the Braves boast a potent offense and a strong home record, the Red Sox have a secret weapon on the mound in Kutter Crawford, and that could be the difference.\n\nCrawford has been a revelation for Boston this season. The 28-year-right-hander boasts a deceiving delivery and pinpoint control that's left opposing hitters frustrated. His arsenal features a lively fastball that cuts into righties and a devastating curveball that keeps lefties off balance. He's currently sporting a 2-1 record with a stellar 1.56 ERA, showcasing his ability to consistently eat innings.\n\nOn the other side, Reynaldo Lopez, the Braves' starter, has been effective this season but lacks the same level of dominance. While he's got a record of 2-1, it suggests that he doesn't get a ton of run support in his five games of the season. The Red Sox' lineup, while inconsistent at times, has shown the ability to capitalize on mistakes from opposing pitchers. Look for veterans like Rafael Devers and Rob Refsnyder to put pressure on Lopez early.\n\nThe Red Sox shouldn't be fazed by the Braves' home-field advantage. They've shown a scrappiness on the road this season, and their pitching staff has been surprisingly reliable. If their bats can come alive early against Lopez and Crawford can continue his impressive stretch, then an upset victory could be brewing in Atlanta.\n\nThis matchup hinges on pitching, and with Crawford's recent dominance, the Red Sox hold a slight edge. If they can weather the early storm from the Braves' crowd and provide Crawford with some run support, then Boston has a real shot at stealing a win on Tuesday night.\n\nWhy The Braves Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Atlanta Braves return home on Tuesday night, riding a hot streak, to take on the Boston Red Sox in a battle between interleague foes. While the Red Sox boast a solid starter in Kutter Crawford, the Braves have the home-field advantage and a pitcher in Reynaldo Lopez who could exploit some weaknesses in the Boston lineup.\n\nTruist Park has been a fortress for Atlanta this season, and the Braves faithful will be electric against a visiting team. This energy boost can be a significant factor, especially for a pitcher like Lopez. He thrives off a lively crowd and has shown flashes of brilliance this season, sporting a 2-1 record with a remarkable 1.50 ERA. His repertoire features a hard-sinking fastball that can overpower lefties and a deceptive changeup that keeps righties guessing.\n\nOn the other hand, Crawford, despite his impressive 2-1 record and a stingy 1.56 ERA, remains somewhat unproven. The Red Sox offense, though streaky, possesses veterans who can punish mistakes from young pitchers. If Crawford struggles with his command early, the Braves' potent lineup, featuring Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. and Marcel Ozuna, could erupt.\n\nThe Braves' bullpen, boasting a lockdown closer in Raisel Iglesias, will be well-rested and ready to shut the door late in the game. This experience edge could prove crucial against a Boston team that sometimes struggles to manufacture runs late in contests.\n\nWhile Crawford has been impressive, the combination of a hungry Braves lineup, a raucous home crowd, and a crafty veteran pitcher in Lopez positions Atlanta for victory on Tuesday night. Look for the Braves to extend their winning streak and maintain their dominance at Truist Park.\n\nFinal Red Sox-Braves Prediction & Pick\n\nThis should be an exciting matchup between two teams full of young talent. The Atlanta Braves boast one of the more potent lineups in the majors and is going to give up-and-coming hurler Ketter Crawford a ton of problems, especially in hitter-friendly Truist Park. It's up to Reynaldo Lopez to limit the damage on his side and if he can do so expect the Braves to pounce on Crawford and get a much-needed home victory to cut into the Phillies lead atop of the NL East.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_L\u00f3pez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reynaldo L\u00f3pez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Acu\u00f1a_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisel_Iglesias", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raisel Iglesias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Red-Sox-vs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Boston's lineup combined for eight hits, six walks and got runners into scoring position in six out of nine innings.\n\nYet when it came time to get the big hit, the Red Sox collectively couldn't come through.\n\nBoston went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 13 men on base in Tuesday's 4-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves, a frustrating performance against one of the best teams in Major League Baseball. The Red Sox also wasted a gem by starting pitcher Kutter Crawford, who held his own against one of the deepest and most relentless lineups in baseball.\n\nCrawford allowed just two runs over six innings, striking out six while walking two and allowing five hits. The right-hander's ERA for the season is now 1.75, and Crawford has posted a quality start in five of his eight outings, including each of the last four.\n\nThe one blemish on Crawford's line was a two-run home run by Jarred Kelenic, which was his first of the season and put the Braves up 2-0 in the third. The Red Sox had no shortage of baserunners, but the offense wasn't able to answer until the bottom of the sixth, when Braves starter Reynaldo Lopez abruptly lost his command.\n\nBoston drew three walks in the inning, including one with the bases loaded by Reese McGuire to cut the deficit to one. That marked the end of Lopez's night, and Ceddanne Rafaela welcomed reliever Aaron Bummer by bouncing a soft chopper right off the back of his left. Had the ball been fielded cleanly it could have been an inning-ending double play, but instead it wound up in no-man's land and Vaughn Grissom came in to tie the game.\n\nThat was the only hit the Red Sox could muster with men in scoring position all game, and beyond that the team couldn't capitalize any further.\n\nJarren Duran and Rafael Devers struck out with the bases loaded to end the threat, and from there the lineup kept wasting opportunities. The Red Sox caught a particularly unlucky break in the eighth, when Tyler O'Neill laced what looked like a two-run double into left field, only for former Red Sox outfielder Adam Duvall to race in and make an incredible sliding catch to end the inning.\n\nThe Braves, meanwhile, didn't get nearly as much traffic but capitalized on their big opportunity in the bottom of the eighth. After Justin Slaten allowed a leadoff walk to Ozzie Albies, the Braves retook the lead on a Marcell Ozuna RBI single and added another run-scoring fielder's choice by Orlando Arcia, which could have been an inning-ending double play but instead made it 4-2 Atlanta.\n\nThat wound up being all the offense the Braves needed.\n\nJarren Duran continued his historic start in the loss, going 2 for 5 with a double and a triple. He now has six triples, eight doubles and nine stolen bases on the season, and the only other player in franchise history with six-plus triples and nine-plus stolen bases through 36 games is Hall of Famer Tris Speaker all the way back in 1913.\n\nGrissom went 1 for 4 with a run scored in his return to Atlanta, and Wilyer Abreu drew two walks and scored a run.\n\nWith the loss the Red Sox fall to 19-17 on the season. They'll look to salvage a two-game split Wednesday, with first pitch scheduled for 7:20 p.m.\n\nBrayan Bello's rehab start in Portland didn't go perfectly. He allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits with two walks and a home run, but he also struck out five and, more importantly, pitched pain-free in what was likely his last tune-up before returning to the big league rotation.\n\nFollowing the outing, Bello told reporters his next start will be Sunday at Fenway Park against the Nationals, according to Alex Speier of The Boston Globe.\n\nBello has been out since April 19 with right lat tightness, and with his return the Red Sox rotation appears to be rapidly returning to full strength. Nick Pivetta (right elbow flexor strain) is scheduled to be activated on Wednesday and will face off against former teammate Chris Sale in the series finale, and Alex Cora told reporters that Garrett Whitlock (left oblique strain) threw a two-inning bullpen session prior to Tuesday's game and will throw live batting practice on Friday at Fenway Park.\n\nBarring any setbacks Whitlock should make a rehab start next week, which would put him on schedule to return during the upcoming road series against the Tampa Bay Rays between May 20-22.\n\nAfter enjoying perhaps the best start of any Red Sox minor leaguer this season, Ryan Zeferjahn was called up to Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday, putting the hard throwing righty one step away from the majors.\n\nZeferjahn, a 26-year-old originally selected in the third round of the 2019 MLB Draft, had not yet allowed an earned run through his first seven appearances with the Portland Sea Dogs this season, posting a perfect 0.00 ERA over 13.2 innings while striking out 22 and walking only three. His fastball has gotten up to 101 mph this spring and Red Sox evaluators have said his command and consistency have taken huge strides.\n\nTo make room on the WooSox roster, left-hander Brendan Cellucci was sent down to Portland. In addition, infielder Pablo Reyes and right-hander Vladimir Gutierrez, both of whom were designated for assignment by the Red Sox in the past week, each cleared waivers and will remain with the organization after being outrighted to Worcester.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nAtlanta Braves designated hitter Marcell Ozuna (20) follows through on a home run in the third inning of a baseball game against the Boston Red Sox Wednesday, May 8, 2024, in Atlanta. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBIs - both tops in the big leagues - along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole - a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nBoth teams are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home to open a three-game series Friday against Washington, with RHP Tanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) set to face Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (0-3, 6.45 ERA). RHP Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) takes the mound for the Braves on Friday to begin a weekend set at New York. The Mets will go with LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA).\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nAtlanta Braves pitcher Chris Sale delivers to a against the Boston Red Sox batter in the first inning of a baseball game Wednesday, May 8, 2024, in Atlanta.

He drove one to the warning track in his final at-bat and heard chants of \"MVP! MVP!\" from the crowd at Truist Park.\n\nOzuna shrugged off the adulation, which is a far cry from a year ago when he was struggling badly and his time in Atlanta appeared to be winding down.\n\n\"Even if you do great, you have to be on the same level,\" he said. \"Don't get comfortable.\"\n\nSale (5-1) pitched for the Red Sox from 2018-23 -- a tenure that began with a World Series championship but was largely marred by injuries before he was traded to Atlanta this past winter.\n\nIt was strange facing his former team, but he quickly settled in.\n\n\"I respect those guys. I love those guys,\" Sale said. \"But we're here to win.\"\n\nThe left-hander sure seems to have regained the form that made him one of baseball's most dominant starters. He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\n\"I went into the offseason on a mission,\" Sale said, \"I got after it. I knew I had to do it this year.\"\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come. On this date a year ago, he was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this year.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\n\"Austin beating that ball out is a huge play,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"That gives us four runs, which is pretty much the difference in the game.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home to open a three-game series Friday against Washington, with RHP Tanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) set to face Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (0-3, 6.45 ERA). RHP Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) takes the mound for the Braves on Friday to begin a weekend set at New York.

Reliever Aaron Bummer's attempt at an inning-ending double play ball was hit off of his own shin, bringing in the second run of the inning, but he got two strikeouts of Jarren Duran and Rafael Devers to keep the game tied at two.\n\nL\u00f3pez varied his velocity a lot more than usual tonight, reaching back and getting his old reliever fastball of 98.0 for a strikeout of Tyler O'Neil in the 5th and dropping it down as low as 91.6 to get Vaughn Grissom out ahead in the 4th. His game average of 95.3 was within one-tenth of a mph of his season average, however, and this appeared to be just more of the evolution of L\u00f3pez as a starter. He finished the outing with only eight whiffs and a slightly below-average 29% CSW, although he also threw only five curveballs among his 91 pitches (54 strikes).\n\nThe Braves traded for outfielder Jarred Kelenic from the Seattle Mariners because they loved his defense and thought they could unlock more offensive consistency from the talented but streaky former top prospect.\n\nKelenic's power numbers to start the season have been down, though, with no homers through his first 26 regular season games in a Braves uniform.\n\nThat ended tonight.\n\nKelenic took Red Sox starter Kutter Crawford deep tonight, only Crawford's second homer allowed of the season, in the bottom of the 3rd inning to put Atlanta on the board.\n\nThe Big Bear is inevitable.\n\nWith a tied ballgame in the 8th inning and Braves on both first and second, designated hitter Marcell Ozuna extended his MLB-leading RBI total to 34 with a well-placed ground ball up the middle that evaded the Red Sox defenders for long enough to score Ozzie Albies from second.\n\nAtlanta followed that up with an RBI groundout that should have ended the inning - hitting it to first baseman Garrett Cooper, he threw to second base to start the double play but second baseman Vaughn Grissom and shortstop Ceddanne Rafaela - playing only their third game together after Grissom was activated off of the injured list last weekend - got crossed up and Rafaela couldn't even attempt the throw back to first.\n\nDefense matters, folks.\n\nAtlanta's closer settled some lingering nerves that Braves fans had with a clean inning tonight, sitting down the Red Sox in order for his 9th save of the season. It's the first time Iglesias has had a 1-2-3 inning since April 22nd and it's his 199th career save.\n\nAtlanta wraps up the short series with Boston tomorrow night; the Red Sox have yet to announce a starter but it's expected that Nick Pivetta will be activated off of the injured list (flexor strain) to make the start. Atlanta's countering with former Red Sox starter Chris Sale, facing his former team for the first time since an offseason trade brought him to Atlanta. First pitch from Truist Park is scheduled for 7:20 PM ET.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsay_crosby@si.com", "name":

He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBIs -- both tops in the big leagues -- along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nBoth teams are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home to open a three-game series Friday against Washington, with RHP Tanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) set to face Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (0-3, 6.45 ERA). RHP Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) takes the mound for the Braves on Friday to begin a weekend set at New York. The Mets will go with LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA).", "source": {"uri": "wdef.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 12 Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_nyman@wdef.com", "name": "Rick Nyman",

He's back in Atlanta after playing 64 games for the Braves over the last two years. He was drafted by Atlanta in the 11th round of the 2019 draft and was with the organization until the end of December, when the Braves sent him to Boston for lefty Chris Sale and cash.\n\n\"I used to turn left, now I turn right,\" Grissom said about his path to the visitor's clubhouse. \"I made sure to take a video of us entering as the first time going the other way. It's all love.\"\n\nRob Refsnyder, who left Sunday's win over the Twins with left hamstring tightness, isn't in the lineup but is expected to avoid the injured list. It'll be Tyler O'Neill, Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu in the lineup (in that formation) against right-hander Reynaldo Lopez. Garrett Cooper is the first baseman with Dominic Smith serving as the designated hitter.

The only current members of Boston's roster who have faced Sale are all imports from other teams - newly acquired first baseman Garrett Cooper (Chicago Cubs) is 0-3 and outfielder Rob Refsnyder is 2-8 (multiple teams).\n\nPivetta was masterful to start the season - 1-1 with a 0.82 ERA - before going on the injured list with a flexor strain that kept him out of action for just over a month. He's 2-3 with a 6.75 ERA in his last five starts against Atlanta, including giving up seven runs on eight hits in just four innings last season in Truist Park. Several Braves have hit him well, with Orlando Arcia being 4-5 with a homer, three RBIs, and a 2.233 OPS and catcher Travis d'Arnaud being 3-4 with a homer, three RBIs, and a 2.500 OPS.\n\nToday's series finale is slated for a 7:20 PM ET first pitch.

They were held to a combined six runs while being swept in three games by the Los Angeles Dodgers to end a 1-5 road trip.\n\n\"It's a rough thing to go through,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"We're not through it yet.\"\n\nThe Braves again relied on their pitching, including left-hander Aaron Bummer, who struck out Jaren Duran and Rafael Evers to end the sixth after the Red Sox scored two runs off L\u00f3pez.\n\n\"I got the top of the order out and limited the damage,\" Bummer said.\n\nAtlanta right-hander Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-0) stranded two runners in the eighth when Adam Duvall made a sliding catch of Tyler O'Neill's drive toward the left-center gap to end the inning.\n\nRaisel Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save.\n\nWith the game tied at 2, Boston right-hander Justin Slaten (2-1) walked Ozzie Albies and gave up a single to Austin Riley to open the eighth. Ozuna bounced a one-out grounder through the infield to drive in Albies. Riley advanced to third on the play and scored on Orlando Arcia's grounder to first, extending the lead to two runs.\n\nCrawford hit Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch in the third inning before Jarred Kelenic pulled a belt-high cutter 368 feet over the high right-field wall for a two-run homer, his first, giving Atlanta a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was only the second homer allowed in eight starts for Crawford, each coming in his last two starts.\n\nCrawford (1.56) and L\u00f3pez (1.50) began the night ranked among the ERA leaders in the majors for pitchers with at least five starts.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up at least one hit in each of his first five innings, but was effective in pitching out of trouble.\n\n\"I loved to see when he got in trouble he was reaching back for 98,\" Snitker said of L\u00f3pez's fastball.\n\nDuran was stranded after leading off the game with a double and hitting a one-out triple in the fifth. L\u00f3pez struck out Devers and Tyler O'Neill to end the fifth.\n\nL\u00f3pez couldn't overcome three sixth-inning walks, including a bases-loaded pass to Reese McGuire that forced in a run. Ceddanne Rafaela's infield single off the back of Bummer's right knee drove in Vaughn Grissom, who reached on shortstop Orlando Arcia's fielding error, for a 2-2 tie.", "source": {"uri":

After averaging 9.9 hits and 5.9 runs over the first 24 games, the Braves have averaged only 6.1 hits and 2.5 runs over the last eight games and fell out of first place in the National League East.\n\n\"We're struggling offensively. There's no doubt about that,\" Atlanta manager Brian Snitker told reporters. \"We're not hitting on all cylinders. It happens. Guys are working hard and it's just not translating on the field right now.\"\n\nMatt Olson (.197, three home runs), Austin Riley (.237, three homers) and reigning National League MVP Ronald Acuna Jr. (.268, two homers) have not produced to their standards. But Acuna did hit a home run Friday, with his first three-hit game of the season Saturday.\n\nOnly Marcell Ozuna (.306, 10 homers, 33 RBIs) and Ozzie Albies (.297) have provided offensive consistency.\n\nThe Braves are running into a hot pitcher, too.\n\nOver his last 11 starts, dating back to Aug. 12, Crawford has recorded a 1.88 ERA and a .186 opponent batting average. In his last start on Wednesday against San Francisco, he pitched a career-high seven innings and allowed two runs on four hits, two walks and six strikeouts.\n\nIn a slight setback, Crawford's homerless streak of 51 2/3 innings, the longest active streak in the major leagues, was snapped.\n\n\"That was good,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora told reporters. \"He worked hard in the offseason to get to this point. Very proud of him. He's been awesome, absolutely great. He got hit hard in the middle of the game, but that's part of it, right? He threw a lot of strikes with good stuff, and he maintained his stuff throughout the outing.\"\n\nCrawford will make his first career appearance against the Braves.\n\nLopez continues to provide consistent starts for Atlanta. In his most recent outing Tuesday at Seattle, he took a loss after giving up a season-high three runs on six hits, two walks and seven strikeouts in five innings.\n\nIn six career appearances (three starts) against Boston, Lopez is 2-1 with a 4.03 ERA. He pitched one inning of scoreless relief against the Red Sox last year.\n\nThe series will also mark the return of former Atlanta prospect Vaughn Grissom. He was the key part of the trade that brought pitcher Chris Sale from Boston to Atlanta. Sale will start Wednesday's game.\n\nGrissom, who had been out all season with a left hamstring strain, made his debut with the Red Sox on Friday against the Twins and went 1-for-5 with a two-run double on Sunday.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bnd.com", "name": "Field Level

With one out, Ozuna bounced a grounder through the infield to drive in Albies for a 3-2 lead. Riley advanced to third on the play and scored on Orlando Arcia's grounder to first, extending the lead to two runs.\n\nCrawford hit Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch in the third inning before Jarred Kelenic pulled a belt-high cutter 368 feet over the high right-field wall for a two-run homer, his first, giving Atlanta a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was only the second homer allowed in eight starts for Crawford, each coming in his last two starts.\n\nCrawford (1.56) and L\u00f3pez (1.50) began the night ranked among the ERA leaders in the majors for pitchers with at least five starts.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up at least one hit in each of his first five innings, but was effective in pitching out of trouble. Jaren Duran was stranded after leading off the game with a double and hitting a one-out triple in the fifth. L\u00f3pez struck out Rafael Devers and Tyler O'Neill to end the fifth.\n\nL\u00f3pez couldn't overcome three sixth-inning walks, including a bases-loaded pass to Reese McGuire that forced in a run. Ceddanne Rafaela's infield single off the back of left-hander Aaron Bummer's right knee, drove in Vaughn Grissom, who reached on shortstop Orlando Arcia's fielding error, for a 2-2 tie.\n\nAtlanta right-hander Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-0) stranded two runners in the eighth when Adam Duvall made a sliding catch of Tyler O'Neill's drive toward the left-center gap to end the inning.\n\nRaisel Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: OF/DH Masataka Yoshida (left thumb strain), who was placed on the injured list on May 1, will have a second opinion on Wednesday. ... RHP Garrett Whitlock (left oblique strain) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment next week.\n\nBraves: LHP Tyler Matzek, who missed the 2023 season following Tommy John surgery on his left elbow, was placed on the 15-day injured list with inflammation in the elbow. The move came after another reliever, RHP Pierce Johnson, landed on the 15-day IL on Sunday with right elbow inflammation. LHP Ray Kerr was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAtlanta LHP Chris Sale (4-1, 3.44 ERA), who pitched for Boston from 2017-23 before being traded to the Braves in a deal that sent infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Red Sox, will face his former teammates on Wednesday night. Boston RHP Nick Pivetta (right elbow flexor strain) is expected to come off the IL and be ready to pitch five innings.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBIs -- both tops in the big leagues -- along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBoth teams are off Thursday. The Red Sox return home to open a three-game series Friday against Washington, with RHP Tanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) set to face Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (0-3, 6.45 ERA). RHP Charlie Morton (2-0, 3.50 ERA) takes the mound for the Braves on Friday to begin a weekend set at New York. The Mets will go with LHP Jose Quintana (1-3, 5.20 ERA).\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Should be a good one tonight.\n\nL\u00f3pez's first season in Atlanta is going even better than anyone could have expected - transitioning from relief to a starting role, he has the lowest ERA on Atlanta's staff. There's not much of a sample size on Boston's position player group against L\u00f3pez, with one notable exception: Third baseman Rafael Devers is 5-11 with a homer, four RBIs, and a 1.318 OPS off of L\u00f3pez.\n\nKutter Crawford, similar to L\u00f3pez, is also leading his staff in ERA. He's coming off of a streak of three straight quality starts with a combined six runs and sixteen strikeouts, with Boston winning three of those matchups.

Boston's lineup combined for eight hits, six walks and got runners into scoring position in six out of nine innings.\n\nYet when it came time to get the big hit, the Red Sox collectively couldn't come through.\n\nBoston went 1 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 13 men on base in Tuesday's 4-2 loss to the Atlanta Braves, a frustrating performance against one of the best teams in Major League Baseball. The Red Sox also wasted a solid start by starting pitcher Kutter Crawford, who held his own against one of the deepest and most relentless lineups in baseball.\n\n\"We had traffic all over the place and we didn't cash in,\" Red Sox manager Alex Cora said afterwards. \"In certain situations we have to be humble and take what they give us, advance the runner, put the ball in play, and we didn't do that.\"\n\nCrawford allowed just two runs over six innings, striking out six while walking two and allowing five hits. The right-hander's ERA for the season is now 1.75, and Crawford has posted a quality start in five of his eight outings, including each of the last four.\n\nThe one blemish on Crawford's line was a two-run home run by Jarred Kelenic, which was his first of the season and put the Braves up 2-0 in the third. The Red Sox had no shortage of baserunners, but the offense wasn't able to answer until the bottom of the sixth, when Braves starter Reynaldo Lopez abruptly lost his command.\n\nBoston drew three walks in the inning, including one with the bases loaded by Reese McGuire to cut the deficit to one. That marked the end of Lopez's night, and Ceddanne Rafaela welcomed reliever Aaron Bummer by bouncing a soft chopper right off the back of his left. Had the ball been fielded cleanly it could have been an inning-ending double play, but instead it wound up in no-man's land and Vaughn Grissom came in to tie the game.\n\nThat was the only hit the Red Sox could muster with men in scoring position all game, and beyond that the team couldn't capitalize any further.\n\nJarren Duran and Rafael Devers struck out with the bases loaded to end the threat, and from there the lineup kept wasting opportunities. The Red Sox caught a particularly unlucky break in the eighth, when Tyler O'Neill laced what looked like a go-ahead two-run double into left field, only for former Red Sox outfielder Adam Duvall to race in and make an incredible sliding catch to end the inning.\n\nThe Braves, meanwhile, didn't get nearly as much traffic but capitalized on their big opportunity in the bottom of the eighth. After Justin Slaten allowed a leadoff walk to Ozzie Albies, the Braves retook the lead on a Marcell Ozuna RBI single and added another run-scoring fielder's choice by Orlando Arcia, which could have been an inning-ending double play but instead made it 4-2 Atlanta.\n\nThat wound up being all the offense the Braves needed.\n\nJarren Duran continued his historic start in the loss, going 2 for 5 with a double and a triple. He now has six triples, eight doubles and nine stolen bases on the season, and the only other player in franchise history with six-plus triples and nine-plus stolen bases through 36 games is Hall of Famer Tris Speaker all the way back in 1913.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nGrissom went 1 for 4 with a run scored in his return to Atlanta, and Wilyer Abreu drew two walks and scored a run.\n\nWith the loss the Red Sox fall to 19-17 on the season. They'll look to salvage a two-game split Wednesday, with first pitch scheduled for 7:20 p.m.\n\nBello nearing return\n\nBrayan Bello's rehab start in Portland didn't go perfectly. He allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits with two walks and a home run, but he also struck out five and, more importantly, pitched pain-free in what was likely his last tune-up before returning to the big league rotation.\n\nFollowing the outing, Bello told reporters his next start will be Sunday at Fenway Park against the Nationals, according to Alex Speier of The Boston Globe.\n\nBello has been out since April 19 with right lat tightness, and with his return the Red Sox rotation appears to be rapidly returning to full strength. Nick Pivetta (right elbow flexor strain) is scheduled to be activated on Wednesday and will face off against former teammate Chris Sale in the series finale, and Alex Cora told reporters that Garrett Whitlock (left oblique strain) threw a two-inning bullpen session prior to Tuesday's game and will throw live batting practice on Friday at Fenway Park.\n\nBarring any setbacks Whitlock should make a rehab start next week, which would put him on schedule to return during the upcoming road series against the Tampa Bay Rays between May 20-22.\n\nZeferjahn promoted to WooSox\n\nAfter enjoying perhaps the best start of any Red Sox minor leaguer this season, Ryan Zeferjahn was called up to Triple-A Worcester on Tuesday, putting the hard throwing righty one step away from the majors.\n\nZeferjahn, a 26-year-old originally selected in the third round of the 2019 MLB draft, had not yet allowed an earned run through his first seven appearances with the Portland Sea Dogs this season, posting a perfect 0.00 ERA over 13.2 innings while striking out 22 and walking only three. His fastball has gotten up to 101 mph this spring and Red Sox evaluators have said his command and consistency have taken huge strides.\n\nTo make room on the WooSox roster, left-hander Brendan Cellucci was sent down to Portland. In addition, infielder Pablo Reyes and right-hander Vladimir Gutierrez, both of whom were designated for assignment by the Red Sox in the past week, each cleared waivers and will remain with the organization after being outrighted to Worcester.\n\n\u00a92024 MediaNews Group, Inc.

With one out, Ozuna bounced a grounder through the infield to drive in Albies for a 3-2 lead. Riley advanced to third on the play and scored on Orlando Arcia's grounder to first, extending the lead to two runs.\n\nCrawford hit Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch in the third inning before Jarred Kelenic pulled a belt-high cutter 368 feet over the high right-field wall for a two-run homer, his first, giving Atlanta a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was only the second homer allowed in eight starts for Crawford, each coming in his last two starts.\n\nCrawford (1.56) and L\u00f3pez (1.50) began the night ranked among the ERA leaders in the majors for pitchers with at least five starts.\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up at least one hit in each of his first five innings, but was effective in pitching out of trouble. Jaren Duran was stranded after leading off the game with a double and hitting a one-out triple in the fifth. L\u00f3pez struck out Rafael Devers and Tyler O'Neill to end the fifth.\n\nL\u00f3pez couldn't overcome three sixth-inning walks, including a bases-loaded pass to Reese McGuire that forced in a run.

The move came after another reliever, RHP Pierce Johnson, landed on the 15-day IL on Sunday with right elbow inflammation. LHP Ray Kerr was recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAtlanta LHP Chris Sale (4-1, 3.44 ERA), who pitched for Boston from 2017-23 before being traded to the Braves in a deal that sent infielder Vaughn Grissom to the Red Sox, will face his former teammates on Wednesday night.

The victory ended the Braves' three-game losing streak and handed the Red Sox their fourth loss in five games.\n\nSale will be facing the Red Sox for the first time since being acquired by the Braves in an offseason trade that sent second baseman Vaughn Grissom to Boston. Sale played for the Red Sox from 2017-23, going 46-30 with a 3.27 ERA in 115 starts.\n\n\"I had great experiences with everyone there,\" Sale said. \"I have a lot of love and respect for everyone over there. They were in my corner when I needed them most. I'll always appreciate that and I'll never take it for granted.\"\n\nSale pitched five solid innings last Wednesday at Seattle, allowing one run on six hits while recording a season-high nine strikeouts. He earned Atlanta's only win on its six-game road trip.\n\nSale is 2-1 with a 2.29 ERA in 10 career games (five starts) against the Red Sox.\n\nPivetta will be activated from the injured list after being out with a right elbow flexor strain. He made a rehab start Triple-A Worcester on Thursday and allowed four runs on three hits and four walks, with five strikeouts in three innings.\n\n\"He's good, he threw the ball well,\" Boston manager Alex Cora said. \"Struggled early with command or the strike zone, whatever it was. Very happy with the way he competed. Velo was good and everything is trending in the right direction.\"\n\nPivetta was pitching well before the injury. He had 13 strikeouts and one walk over 11 innings.\n\nHe has 19 career appearances (15 starts) against Atlanta, going 7-4 with a 5.04 ERA. He was 1-1 with a 7.90 ERA against the Braves in 2023, making one start and entering the second game in the second inning after the Red Sox used John Schreiber as an opener.\n\nThe Atlanta bullpen took another hit on Tuesday when left-hander Tyler Matzek was placed on the injured list with left elbow inflammation. Last week the Braves placed right-handed setup man Pierce Johnson on the injured list with inflammation in his pitching elbow.\n\nMatzek is trying to return from Tommy John surgery in 2022 and has a 9.90 ERA, allowing 11 runs in 10 innings over 11 relief appearances. Matzek was replaced by left-hander Ray Kerr, who went 0-1 with a 4.50 ERA in nine appearances for Triple-A Gwinnett.\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing, just get (Matzek) calmed down and get him back right,\" Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.\n\nThe Braves will take Thursday off before going to New York for a three-game weekend series against the Mets. The Red Sox, 1-3 on their road trip, are off Thursday and return home for a three-game set versus the Washington Nationals.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType":

The Red Sox were 0-for-6 with runners on base and left seven runners on base against Sale, whose scoreless outing was saved in the sixth when left fielder Jarred Kelenic reached over the wall to take away a homer from Garrett Cooper.\n\nOzuna was 2-for-3 with a walk, scored two runs and hit his 11th and 12th home runs of the season, most in the majors. Ozuna drove in four runs and leads the majors with 38 RBIs. It was Ozuna's second multi-homer game of the season.\n\nAtlanta got two scoreless innings from Dylan Lee. Ray Kerr threw a perfect ninth inning in his Atlanta debut.\n\nBoston starter Nick Pivetta (1-2) was not sharp in his return from the injured list with an elbow flexor strain. In his first start since April 3, Pivetta pitched four innings and gave up five runs on seven hits, walking one and striking out one.\n\nBoston has lost five of its past six games.\n\nAn overturned call paved the way for the Braves to score four runs in the first inning. Austin Riley appeared to have grounded into an inning-ending double play but the Braves appealed and the review showed Riley beat the throw to first base.\n\nGiven new life, Atlanta got a single from Matt Olson and a three-run homer from Ozuna. Orlando Arcia followed with a solo homer, his third of the year.\n\nOzuna went deep again in the third inning, a solo shot to center field that upped the Braves' lead to 5-0.\n\nBoth teams are off on Thursday. Atlanta starts a three-game series at New York on Friday, while Boston returns home to host Washington in a three-game set.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozuna", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Ozuna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Kelenic", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Kelenic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Olson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Olson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/wvksyk/picture288427099/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/40137106-245b-4a0f-b5cb-8ac3d1c6ddc4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1017, "textEnd": 1024}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nRafaela collects two hits in loss to Braves\n\nCeddanne Rafaela went 2-for-4 with one RBI in Tuesday's loss to the Braves. Rafaela singled in the sixth with the bases loaded to score Vaughn Grissom, tying the game at 2-2 after a Reese McGuire walk forced home their first run of the evening. Rafaela is slashing a meager .211/.255/.379 on the year but is batting .263 over the last two weeks. He's heating up a bit after getting off to a slow start, but shouldn't be counted on in fantasy outside of the most desperate situations.\n\nKelenic hits first home run of season\n\nJarred Kelenic went 2-for-2 with a home run and two RBI in the Braves' win over the Red Sox on Tuesday. It took 73 at bats for Kelenic to finally hit his first homer of the season. His two-run blast in the third gave the Braves an early 2-0 lead, but the Red Sox would battle back before the Braves finally went up 4-2. Kelenic has struggled to make the most of his platooned role, and can't be relied on by fantasy managers at this time.\n\nTake the under. The under is 7-1 in the Red Sox' last eight games overall, is 5-1 in their last six interleague games and is 9-2 in their last 11 games against an opponent from the National League East Division.

Over six shutout innings, he held the Red Sox to six hits, one walk, induced 20 swings and misses, and set new season highs with 10 strikeouts -- nine of which came on his slider -- and 103 pitches, 69 for strikes.\n\nSale, 35, was in rare form from the jump, beginning the contest by striking out Jarren Duran on three pitches. He got the leadoff man the same way in the top of the third, too.\n\nConnor Wong ripped a double off Sale in the first and a single in the third, but found himself stranded on base each time, as the Red Sox's struggles to drive in runs continued. Boston went 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position and left nine on base, bringing their LOB total to 21 over the two-game series; they entered the day second only to the Yankees on the AL leaderboard in leaving man on base.\n\n\"We didn't cash in,\" a frustrated Alex Cora told reporters. \"I think we went 0-for-whatever with men in scoring position. He was good, and we've seen that before, but we need to be better. We have to.\"\n\nWong's first-inning two-bagger would turn out to be the lineup's only extra-base hit of the contest, and he was the only man in the lineup with multiple hits. Tyler O'Neill drew their only walk. Duran and Wilyer Abreu each struck out three times.\n\nAfter praising his team for playing \"good baseball\" throughout their recent low-scoring losses, the Red Sox manager took a more serious, frustrated tone when discussing the offense on Wednesday night.\n\n\"We didn't hit throughout the road trip,\" Cora said. \"You start looking at our offense, and we fall into this trap that, it looks really really good because we score runs, but I mean, look at the shutouts and the percentage of games that we haven't score more than two runs. We gotta be better.\"\n\nSunday's 9-2 victory over the Twins notwithstanding, the Red Sox offense is in cold spell of arctic proportions. Despite entering the day with an MLB-leading 10 players with at least 10 RBIs and boasting an offense that ranks in the top five in the AL in nearly every offensive category -- including second in slugging and doubles, third in OPS and fifth in hits -- it's a feast-or-famine operation propped up by grandiose victories. Boston is 2-13 when they score less than four runs and 0-14 when trailing after six innings. They're 7-12 when they don't homer, and dating back to April 28, they've only homered twice over their last eight games. Over their first seven games of the month, they've averaged three runs per contest and struck out 73 times.\n\nWhen Sale came back out for the sixth inning, he opened with a strikeout on the very edge of the zone to none other than his trade partner, Vaughn Grissom. The infielder thought he'd drawn a walk; instead, it was one of 13 times the Red Sox punched out. Sale bookended the inning with a swinging strikeout to Romy Gonzalez, and strode off the mound triumphantly.\n\n\"I'm just glad I didn't suck,\" the lefty told reporters.\n\nSale wasn't perfect, but he didn't have to be. Unlike the Red Sox, who often squandered his strongest starts -- that 17-strikeout game against the Rockies comes to mind -- his new team gave him everything he needed. The Braves bats gave him immediate, sizable run support; in 2019, only five AL starters received less run support than the 3.7 runs-per-innings-pitched Sale got from the Red Sox lineup. He also had a strong defense backing him, highlighted by Austin Riley's barehanded throw to first to nab the speedy Ceddanne Rafaela, and Jarred Kelenic's leaping catch for the second out of the sixth. Garrett Cooper would've had a home run in 22 ballparks. Instead, viewers near and far were treated to a far rarer sight: a smiling Sale on the mound, laughing into his glove.\n\nBut for Boston, the story of the game was almost set in stone from the first inning. After the lineup left two men on base in the top of the frame, Nick Pivetta thought Rafaela had completed an inning-ending double play, and returned to the dugout to regroup for the next inning.\n\nInstead, the Braves challenged the call, and after a lengthy review, the ruling on the field was overturned, and the Sox starter had to return to the mound. He gave up a single to Matt Olson to put runners on first and second.\n\nWednesday was Pivetta's first start after a stint on the 15-day injured list with a mild flexor strain, and Marcell Ozuna welcomed him back the way Rafael Devers often greets Gerrit Cole: loudly. Atlanta's designated hitter got his team on the board with a three-run homer, and Orlando Arcia made it back-to-back bombs with his own solo homer. The Red Sox were in an immediate, significant hole; not only would they never climb out, they wouldn't score at all.\n\n\"Man, we were shaking hands, giving high-fives because of the double play,\" Cora said. \"He went from high-fiving in the dugout (and) a nice double play, to be down four-nothing.\"\n\nIn Ozuna's next at-bat, he homered again, extending the lead to 5-0 in the third. Duran climbed the wall hoping to snatch the ball back, but it was in vain.\n\nPivetta exited after four, charged with five earned runs on seven hits, one walk, and only one strikeout. Josh Winckowski, Cam Booser, Chris Martin and Chase Anderson made sure the Braves wouldn't score again for the rest of the night, but Atlanta already had more than enough.\n\n\"Thank you and I'm sorry,\" Sale told NESN before the game, when Jahmai Webster asked if the southpaw had a message to Red Sox Nation.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, he wasn't the one who was sorry.", "source": {"uri":

For most of that span, Boston could not get the bats going.\n\nThat was the case on Wednesday night in a 5-0 loss to old friend Chris Sale and the Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe lefty held the Red Sox to just six hits in six innings while racking up 10 strikeouts. Over the two game series in Atlanta, the Red Sox missed their chances to break through and left a combined 22 runners on base over 18 innings of play.\n\n\"We put some pressure on him and we didn't cash in,\" Alex Cora told reporters, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"I think we went 0-for-whatever with runners in scoring position.

You look into our offense and we fall into this trap where it's really, really good because we score runs, but look at the shutouts. The percentage of games where we haven't scored more than two runs. We gotta be better.\"\n\nThe Red Sox scored more than two runs just once on the road trip, which led to their lone win in the series finale against the Minnesota Twins. Boston's bats are capable. Finding consistency on a nightly basis remains a point of emphasis for Cora's lineup.\n\n\"The story should be that offensively, we have to be better,\" Cora added.\n\nHere are more notes from Wednesday's Red Sox-Braves game:\n\n-- Sale struck out 10 Red Sox hitters for the second time in his career, last doing so with the Chicago White Sox in 2014. He also struck out 10 hitters for the first time with the Braves.\n\n-- Boston fell to 1-4 on the road trip.\n\n-- The Red Sox fall to 9-5 all-time at Truist Park, dating back to the 2017 season.\n\n-- Chris Martin took the mound for the first time in a week and delivered his second-straight scoreless appearance for the Red Sox.\n\n-- Nick Pivetta made his first start for the Red Sox since April 3 after an injured list stint with a flexor strain. Pivetta allowed three home runs on the night in the loss, going four innings with seven hits and five earned runs allowed.\n\n\"The pitch to Ozuna wasn't bad, the pitch to Arcia was better,\" Cora said. \"Obviously, for his first one, OK. It went from high-fiving in the dugout on a nice double play to down 4-0.\"\n\n\"Sweeper was off,\" Pivetta told reporters, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"Cutter was good. Curveball was good. Fastball location was off today. ... I'm in a big-league baseball game. I expect myself to be the same and go out there and produce the way I want to given what I have to do. Things happen, I would've liked to have done better. It is what it is.\"\n\n-- The Red Sox return home to Fenway Park to begin a three-game series with the Washington Nationals on Friday night. First pitch is set for 7:10 p.m. ET. You can catch the game, plus 90 minutes of pregame coverage, on NESN.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_crowley@nesn.com", "name": "Tim Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenway Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/rafael-devers_c89d13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1906, "textEnd": 1913}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

With one out and a runner on first, Austin Riley hit a grounder to Ceddanne Rafaela at shortstop. Rafaela had to charge the ball, making a stellar backhanded play, converting a force at second base.\n\nVaughn Grissom made the transfer and initially got the out call at first for an inning-ending double play. But the Braves challenged and the call was overturned to keep the inning alive. The next batter was Matt Olson, who tapped a slow dribbler to the left side for a hit, setting the table for Ozuna.\n\nThat wasn't the last time Ozuna tagged Pivetta. The Braves slugger hunted down Pivetta in the third inning, belting a first-pitch cutter to left-center, marking Ozuna's sixth career homer against Pivetta in 26 at-bats.\n\nPivetta lasted just four innings, yielding seven hits and walking one. He struggled to land his cutter-slider mix for strikes and the Braves weren't biting on either of those pitches off the plate. It made it easier for Atlanta to sit on Pivetta's four-seamer.\n\nOn the contrary, the Sox lineup couldn't figure out Sale's puzzle. Even though he was near 60 pitches through three innings, Sale carved up the Red Sox. The Sox had some traffic against Sale, but similar to Tuesday evening, left runners hanging, going 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position against the former Sox ace.\n\nThe Red Sox had runners on first and second with two outs in the first, but a Devers ground out and Grissom strikeout ended the threat. Then in the fifth, the Sox had runners on first and second again with one out, this time, Tyler O'Neill and Devers collected consecutive strikeouts to end the frame.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcell_Ozuna", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marcell Ozuna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Olson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Olson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/lQu0MN5yj4QqZDXefLTXQcQGyaI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/SFESXLHJZ4C4BDX7IWKVQNC4FQ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Advance the runner, put the ball in play and we didn't do that.\"\n\nCeddanne Rafaela was the only Red Sox batter to plate a Boston run when he reached on an infield single that hit Aaron Bummer off the back of the leg in the sixth inning. The rest of the lineup failed to capitalize, including Rafael Devers who went 0-for-3 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"That happens. That's baseball,\" Devers told reporters through translator Carlos Villoria Ben\u00edtez, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"Everybody that goes out there to hit, they want to bring those runs in and that's part of the game.\"\n\nKutter Crawford pitched another gem for the Red Sox.

He did a good job. He kept them off balance. He did a good job with the running game, slowed them down. ... Overall another good one.\"\n\nThe two runs Crawford made was an 88 MPH cutter Jarred Kelenic connected on for his first home run of the season.\n\n\"I made one mistake to Kelenic and put us down in the hole two nothing,\" Crawford said after the game, as seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"The offense did a good job of scratching some runs across to tie the ball game. I'm glad I left it at that and make sure it didn't get any bigger than that. Two runs, six innings, we had a chance. Just somethings didn't happen to go our way.\"\n\nHere are more notes from Tuesday's Red Sox-Braves game:\n\n-- Rafaela extended his hitting streak to six games with his two singles in the loss. The shortstop is slashing .211/.231/.374 this season with three home runs and 20 RBIs.\n\n-- Crawford has the fifth-lowest ERA in the majors to start the season with 1.75 in eight starts. He has pitched 46 1/3 innings while allowing nine earned runs on 35 hits with 46 strikeouts and 15 walks.\n\n-- The Red Sox fell to 3-10 when their opponents score first, 2-12 when they score less than four runs, 5-7 in series openers and 19-17 overall.\n\n-- The Red Sox complete their five-game road trip with the second of two games against the Braves.

The Braves send long-time Boston starter Chris Sale to the mound to face his former team for the first time after Atlanta took Game 1 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves are starting Chris Sale who played six seasons with the Boston Red Sox before getting traded in December. Sale is a seven-time All-Star but his 2020 season was wiped out by Tommy John surgery and the ensuing years have been injury-plagued. However, he finally looks healthy and has a 3.44 ERA with a 0.95 WHIP through six starts.\n\nThe Red Sox respond with Nick Pivetta, who was off to a terrific start this season, allowing just one run through his first two outings before an elbow injury sent him to the IL.\n\nAlthough Pivetta has a sterling 0.82 ERA, that's based on a small sample size of just 11 innings that came inside pitcher-friendly ballparks against two of the worst offensive teams in the AL. His expected ERA is 3.43, which is closer to his 4.39 ERA over the previous three years. He also struggled with his control in a rehab start at Triple-A Worcester last Thursday.\n\nOn the other hand, Sale has an xERA of just 2.81 and ranks in the top fifth percentile in average exit velocity and the top 20th in hard-hit rate, groundball rate, strikeout rate, and walk rate.\n\nWhile Atlanta's offense has been in a bit of a rut, this stacked lineup is simply too talented to be held in check for long. The Braves lead the majors in hard-hit rate and average exit velocity while ranking fourth in barrel rate.\n\nThe Red Sox have been far more inconsistent at the dish, ranking 17th in hard-hit rate, 18th in average exit velocity, and 10th in barrel rate. They are also 15th in slugging percentage (.382) against lefties like Sale. Expect positive regression from Atlanta's lineup and negative regression from Pivetta -- who may be on a pitch count in his return from injury -- and back the Braves to win by multiple runs.\n\nSale is coming off a sensational start against the Mariners where he fanned nine batters in just five innings of work. He is in the top fifth percentile in chase rate while ranking in the top 20th in strikeout rate. The Red Sox are just 27th in the majors in strikeout rate (25.7%) with that number ballooning to 29.5% versus southpaws.\n\nRonald Acuna Jr. was named 2023 NL MVP when he scored an incredible 149 runs -- the second-most in a season since 1950. He is fourth in the majors with 31 runs this year and since we're expecting the Braves to win by multiple runs here, it makes sense to target the All-Star leadoff man.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Braves have covered the Run Line in 33 of their last 55 games at home (+9.25 Units / 14% ROI).

Sale pitched six scoreless innings, and the Braves won, 5-0. John Bazemore/Associated Press\n\nATLANTA -- Marcell Ozuna kept up his torrid start with two more homers, and Chris Sale pitched six innings against his former team, leading the Atlanta Braves to a 5-0 victory over the Boston Red Sox and a sweep of their two-game interleague series Wednesday night.\n\nOzuna hit a three-run shot in the first inning and added a solo drive in the third off Nick Pivetta, who was roughed up in his first start since coming off the injured list.\n\nSale (5-1) pitched for the Red Sox from 2018-23 - a tenure that began with a World Series championship but was largely marred by injuries before he was traded to Atlanta this past winter.\n\nThe left-hander sure seems to have regained the form that made him one of baseball's most dominant starters. He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBI, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBI - both tops in the big leagues - along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first inning with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole - a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 because of a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: Catcher Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup. Murphy hasn't played since the March 29 season opener, when he strained his left oblique swinging at a pitch.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

His outing against the Red Sox on Wednesday night was not just any old start.\n\n\"It's always weird facing your old team,\" said Sale, a member of the Red Sox for the last seven seasons. \"I've only done it once before, obviously with Chicago. A little bit different this go-around.\n\n\"It was just weird seeing all those guys. It was fun. Facing your friends and old teammates is exciting. And I'm glad I didn't suck.\"\n\nOn May 30, 2017, Sale faced the White Sox, with whom he had spent the first seven years of his career for the first time. That day was emotional as Sale suited up against the only organization he had ever known. But Wednesday's outing, on a hot night at Truist Park, meant more. Sale was a champion in Boston, after all, and was one of most prominent players on one of baseball's most prominent teams for more than a half-decade.\n\n\"We won a championship together,\" Sale said. \"I watched Rafael Devers make his major league debut and turn into a $300 million superstar. I was watching Kutter Crawford at FGCU and think of him as a little brother to me. Even Nick Pivetta, he lived down in southwest Florida and we had entire offseasons together. The list goes on and on. I could sit here and talk about A.C. for the next three hours. It is different.\"\n\nSale spent a chunk of his time before Tuesday's game in left field catching up with Sox manager Alex Cora and his former teammates. On Wednesdays, there wasn't much in the way of pleasantries. Sale tipped his cap to Connor Wong, his catcher for 90\u2154 innings over the last couple of years, when he settled into the box in the first inning. But the real greeting for the Red Sox was a vintage -- and healthy -- Sale absolutely carving them up.\n\nThough the Red Sox had baserunners in each of the first five innings, Sale never ran into much trouble. He needed a season-high 103 pitches to get through six shutout innings and struck out 10 batters for just the fourth time since 2019. He got 20 swings-and-misses and the Braves finished off a 5-0 win to sweep a two-game series.\n\nThe Red Sox' offense, which has been inconsistent through the first six weeks of the season, was mystified by the lanky lefty.\n\n\"I think we made it tough on ourselves, to be honest with you,\" Cora said. \"We put some pressure on him and didn't cash in. He was good. We've seen that before, but we need to be better. We have to. We didn't hit throughout the road trip.\"\n\nSale was motivated by a chance to win a game for the Braves -- and not by an opportunity to show the Red Sox that they moved on from him too early. In December, with one year left on Sale's five-year contract, the Red Sox shipped him to Atlanta for second baseman Vaughn Grissom. Sale, who had full no-trade rights, had to give his stamp of approval. Because of that, there were no hard feelings between the sides when the relationship ended.\n\n\"That was about as clean of a break as you could possibly have from one team to another,\" Sale said. \"If there's anything I want to do, I want to show these guys. I owe it to Atlanta that I can be the best that I can be.\"\n\nSale, who recently turned 35, looks like the old version of himself so far this season. The seven-time All-Star is 5-1 with a 2.95 ERA and 52 strikeouts in 42\u2154 innings over seven starts. He might get another chance to face the Red Sox in a month when the Braves come to Fenway Park for two games on June 4 and 5. Then, he'll have another chance to say hello to some old pals -- and potentially dominate them again.\n\n\"I love those guys. I always will,\" Sale said. \"The memories I made with them, good and bad, make that relationship as solid as it is. On the flip side of that, we're men. This is a competitive game and we have a job to do. I'm very competitive by nature. Those guys over there are as well. You give them a head nod the first time around the batting order. I've got respect for those guys. I love those guys. But we're here to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_cotillo_masslive_com@unionleader.com", "name": "Chris

He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBIs -- both tops in the big leagues -- along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRed Sox: In addition to Pivetta returning, the Red Sox activated Romy Gonzalez from the 10-day injured list and started him at first base. He had been out since April 11 with a left wrist strain.\n\nBraves: C Sean Murphy has been hitting in the cage as he moves toward a return to the lineup.

Raisel Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth to earn his ninth save. Justin Slaten (2-1) took the loss.\n\nIt was a frustrating night for the Boston offense. The Red Sox had eight hits and drew six walks but went 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 13 baserunners.\n\nNeither starter was around for the decision.\n\nAtlanta's Reynaldo Lopez pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed two runs, one earned, on six hits with a season-high four walks and five strikeouts.\n\nBoston's Kutter Crawford worked six innings and yielded two runs on five hits with two walks and six strikeouts. It was the fourth consecutive start in which he pitched at least six innings.\n\nThe Braves broke through for two runs in the third inning when Jarred Kelenic hit his first homer of the season to end an 0-for-11 streak. It was Kelenic's first home run since he went deep on June 9, 2023, against Shohei Ohtani, then of the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Red Sox tied the game at 2-2 after an error by shortstop Arcia created an opportunity. Boston scored when Reese McGuire walked with the bases loaded to chase Lopez, then plated the tying run on Ceddanne Rafaela's infield grounder that hit reliever Aaron Bummer on the right leg. Bummer struck out the next two batters with the bases loaded to end the threat.\n\nBoston threatened in the eighth inning thanks to a throwing error by Jimenez and an intentional walk. Tyler O'Neill lined a ball into left field but was robbed by Adam Duvall's sliding catch.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@fresnobee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raisel_Iglesias", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raisel Iglesias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutter_Crawford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kutter Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynaldo_L\u00f3pez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reynaldo L\u00f3pez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Kelenic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Kelenic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Bummer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Bummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reese_McGuire", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reese McGuire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Duvall", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Duvall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intentional base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/yf77m4/picture288408425/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/b388f4c0-39fb-42cf-9fd5-fc4dfdb56a37", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

If you're a fantasy baseball enthusiast, you probably already know this. He was one of my favorite sleepers heading into the season and became a waiver wire must-add some time ago.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nCrawford has a 1.56 ERA this season and isn't allowing hard contact. His 26.1% hard-hit rate is in the top 3% of the league.\n\nThe Braves have scored the second-most runs per game this season (5.09), but their bats have been cold for the past two weeks. They have managed only 3.18 runs per game across the past two weeks of play. That ranks 27th out of 30 MLB teams.\n\nThe Red Sox have averaged 4.92 runs per game across the last two weeks of play, ranking seventh in MLB.\n\nThe public will be all on the Braves bouncing back at home. After all, the Braves are 11-4 this season when they are the home favorite. It's tempting to back the home team, but the +145 is even more enticing.\n\nThe Yankees swept Houston in the first series of the season at Minute Maid, and now they even get home-field advantage.\n\nSo, why are we backing the Houston Astros, whose bullpen has blown nine saves?\n\nJustin Verlander.\n\nVerlander has been sharp since returning from the IL, allowing only four earned runs across three starts and 17 1/3 innings pitched. Not only that, but this Yankees lineup is hitting a collective .158 and slugging a mere .354 lifetime vs. Verlander.\n\nBoth teams have hit well recently, and yes, Juan Soto seems to be Houston's daddy, but for the plus-money payout, I'm willing to bet the road team comes out on top in a low-scoring affair Tuesday.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_piacenti@si.com", "name": "Jennifer Piacenti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutter_Crawford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kutter Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4878,h_2743,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx8g2dgkx68zkj61c7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Over three seasons in Boston, he's hitting .321/.426/.459 with 63 hits - including 13 doubles, one triple, four home runs - and 33 runs, 30 RBI, four stolen bases, 33 walks, and 45 strikeouts in 196 at-bats against lefties.\n\n1896: The St. Louis Browns (now Cardinals) fire new manager Harry Diddlebock after 17 games due to intoxication. According to various reports, he'd either fallen off a barstool after drinking too much, or found on the street by law enforcement, having fallen off of a streetcar.\n\n1900: Decades before Curt Flood takes a stand, John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson become rarities in baseball when they sign contracts with the Cardinals in which the reserve clauses are crossed out. As a result, they're able to leave St. Louis the following year and continue on their respective paths to managing and the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n1901: In their inaugural season, the Boston Americans (now Red Sox) play their inaugural home opener. Buck Freeman finishes a double shy of the cycle, and Cy Young pitches his third consecutive complete game.\n\n1906: Playing left field, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Albert Bender hits two inside-the-park home runs against the Red Sox.\n\n1925: At Braves Field, the Boston Braves and Chicago Cubs play the Golden Jubilee game to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the National League and its first major league game (Boston Red Caps vs. Philadelphia Athletics, April 22, 1876). Other NL teams will follow suit throughout the season, but the Braves and Cubs are the only remaining clubs from the original NL charter.\n\n1926: A three-alarm fire destroys most Fenway Park's left-field grandstand seating.The ruined bleacher sections aren't removed until August, and the Red Sox don't fully repair the area until Tom Yawkey purchases the club in 1933 and pays for renovations that include the Green Monster.\n\n1942: The Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants play the first 'twilight game' in 24 years. Everyone from fans to players and umpires have to pay for admission to the contest at Ebbets Field, which raises nearly $60,000 for the Navy Relief Fund.\n\n1946: Red Sox infielder Johnny Pesky becomes the first American Leaguer to score as many as six runs in a single game.\n\n1953: Billy Goodman's walk-off home run in the 11th inning snaps the Red Sox's streak of 13 consecutive losses to the Yankees.\n\n1957: After almost 11 years, Ted Williams records his second career three-homer game.

On Wednesday, after repeated failures by the Red Sox offense to capitalize on threats, Slaten's worst inning of the year doomed Boston late.\n\nFacing the top of a potent Braves lineup, Slaten allowed two runs and three hits in the eighth inning as Atlanta broke the tie and beat the Red Sox, 4-2. Boston's offense went 1-for-14 with runners ins coring position and left 13 on base, spoiling another excellent outing from Kutter Crawford, who allowed two runs and struck out six in six innings. The Red Sox have lost four of five and are now just two games above .500 at 19-17.\n\nEntering with a 2-2 tie, Slaten fell victim to strong at-bats by Atlanta's hitters and a mix-up in the infield. Ozzie Albies walked to lead off the inning, then Austin Riley singled up the middle. Slaten punched out Matt Olson but gave up the go-ahead run one batter later when Marcell Ozuna ripped a single up the middle. On an Orlando Arcia grounder to first base, Boston's two middle infielders (Ceddanne Rafaela and Vaughn Grissom) got tangled up at second, eliminating the double play possibility and allowing Riley to score an insurance run. In the top of the ninth, Braves closer Raisel Iglesias needed just 14 pitches to record a 1-2-3 inning and the save.\n\nCrawford departed with a no decision after six innings, having allowed just five hits and striking out six batters in six innings. Through 46 \u2153 innings over eight starts, he owns a 1.75 ERA. The only blemish of his night came in the third inning when he hit No. 8 hitter Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch and paid the price when Jarred Kelenic snapped a 232-plate appearance homerless streak with a two-run shot to right. Crawford settled in as the Red Sox continued to threaten, leaving two men on in the each of the first two innings and by wasting leadoff singles in the third and fourth and a one-out triple by Jarren Duran in the fifth. It wasn't until the sixth inning that Boston broke through -- with some help from Braves starter Reynaldo Lopez and his defense.\n\nLopez walked Wilyer Abreu to lead off the inning, then the Sox caught a break when Arcia bobbled a grounder and allowed Grissom to reach. Lopez then walked Garrett Cooper to load the bases before issuing a run-scoring free pass to Reese McGuire and departing the game with the score 2-1. Facing lefty Aaron Bummer, Rafaela laced a hopper up the middle that deflected off the pitcher and plated Grissom, the tying run. Capitalizing on two left-on-left matchups, Bummer then struck out Duran and Rafael Devers to end the inning with three runners stranded.\n\nThe Sox had another chance to take the lead in the bottom of the eighth, when Duran reached on an error and took second and the Braves intentionally walked Devers with two outs. O'Neill laced a liner to left, but Adam Duvall, in a bit of revenge against his former team, corralled it with a sliding catch to keep the game tied.\n\nDuran has big night\n\nDuran led off the game with a double and tripled three innings later, finishing 2-for-5. It was Duran's MLB-leading sixth triple of the season.\n\nAccording to the Red Sox, no Boston player has hit six or more triples in the team's first 36 games since a gentleman named Lou Finney did it in 1940. MassLive did not cover that feat back then.\n\nPivetta will return for matchup vs. Sale on Wednesday\n\nIt'll be a big one Wednesday night in the series finale for a variety of reasons. Righty Nick Pivetta (1-1, 0.82 ERA) will come off the injured list after a six-week absence to start for the Red Sox opposite former teammate Chris Sale (4-1, 3.44 ERA), who is making his first start against the Red Sox since they traded him for Grissom in December. First pitch is at 7:20 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Red Sox will then have Thursday off before welcoming the Nationals and Rays to Fenway Park for a seven-game homestand that starts Friday.", "source": {"uri":

I love those guys.\"\n\nChris Sale on facing his former teammates: In his seven seasons with the Red Sox, Chris Sale experienced the full range of emotions. He delivered two incredible seasons in his first two years with Boston, culminating with a World Series championship in 2018 (with Sale recording the final out himself, striking out Manny Machado).\n\nOver the next five years, however, Sale experienced more difficult circumstances. Limited by a series of injuries, he went just 17-18 with a 4.16 ERA in 298 1/3 innings from 2019-23.\n\nIn the offseason, he was traded to the Braves. Now 35, Sale faced his old team on Wednesday. He finished the night allowing zero runs and striking out 10 over six innings in a 5-0 Atlanta win.\n\nAfter the game, he discussed the odd nature of having to compete against his friends and former colleagues.\n\n\"It's always weird facing your old team,\" Sale told reporters after the game, per MLB.com's Ian Browne. \"I've obviously only done it once before with Chicago. It was a little bit different this go-around.\"\n\nExamining the Red Sox roster, Sale looked back at how much players grew during his time with the team.\n\n\"Yeah, we won a championship together,\" recalled Sale. \"I watched Rafael Devers make his Major League debut and turn into a $300 million superstar. I was watching Kutter Crawford at FGCU. That guy is like a little brother to me. Even Nick Pivetta, he lived in Southwest Florida and we had an entire offseason together. The list goes on and on. I could sit here and talk about [Alex Cora] for the next three hours. It's different.\"\n\nEmphasizing that he had no hard feelings with the Red Sox over the trade, he called it, \"about as clean a break as you could possibly have from one team to another.\"\n\n\"I've said it before and I'll say it again until I run out of breath. I love those guys,\" Sale explained. \"I always will. The memories I made with them were good and bad. On the flip side of that, this is a competitive game and we have a job to do.\"\n\nTrivia: Chris Sale is an alumni of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he pitched for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in 2009 (going 4-2 with a 1.47 ERA). What former Red Sox manager also played for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox, where -- as a 17-year-old -- he hit .294 and led the league in runs scored.\n\n(Answer at the bottom).\n\nHint: Along with the Red Sox, he also managed the Rangers and Mets.\n\nScores and schedules:\n\nThe Bruins lost to the Panthers 6-1 in Game 2 of the second-round playoff series on Wednesday. Game 3 will take place back at TD Garden on Friday at 7 p.m.\n\nThe Red Sox lost to Chris Sale and the Braves, 5-0 (with the former Boston ace throwing six scoreless innings, recording 10 strikeouts). Boston has a day off today and begins a three-game set against the Nationals at Fenway Park on Friday at 7:10 p.m.\n\nTonight, the Celtics host the Cavaliers in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals at 7 p.m. Boston leads Cleveland in the best-of-seven series 1-0.\n\nAlso tonight, PWHL Boston starts its inaugural playoff run on the road against Montreal at 7 p.m.\n\nMore from Boston.com:\n\nThe Patriots' search for a leading executive: While New England might not technically hire a general manager, the \"leading football executive\" (or however it will be defined) is a role the Patriots are currently trying to fill. Director of scouting Eliot Wolf is seen as a strong contender, but others are being interviewed.\n\nOn this day: In 2010, the Celtics defeated the Cavaliers 97-87 in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Rajon Rondo produced one of the best performances of his career, totaling game-highs in points (29), rebounds (18), and assists (13).\n\nBoston would go on to win the series in six games, ending the first LeBron James-Cleveland era with a forgettable early playoff exit.\n\nDaily highlight: The Red Sox were shut out on Wednesday, partly due to former Boston ace Chris Sale, and partly (in one particular case) because of Atlanta left fielder Jarred Kelenic.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hayden_bird@boston.com", "name": "Hayden

Sale spoke after the game about the performance and what it was like wearing a Braves uniform taking down the team he was previously on for six seasons and made countless memories with.\n\nThe 35-year old pitcher was dynamite in the outing as he went six innings, allowing six hits, walked a batter once, and struck out 10 Red Sox hitters while also earning zero earned runs. He said after the game the media during his press conference that he had to get through the \"first few innings\" since they were in \"deep counts,\" but really found his footing afterwards according to NESN.\n\n\"The first few innings was getting into some deep counts,\" Sale said to reporters as it was seen on NESN's postgame coverage. \"Pitch count got up there pretty good. You get through the first inning and you kind of take an exhale. Next thing you know, you've got four runs on the board. That helps a lot too.\"\n\nSale reflects on time with Boston and winning a championship\n\nEven though at the end of the day it's competition, Sale still has appreciation for the Red Sox organization as he had many productive seasons, despite having some injury spells. However, the greatest accomplishment of them all was when Sale was a factor in Boston winning the World Series championship in 2018 which the Florida-native remembers fondly.\n\n\"We won a championship together,\" Sale said. \"I watched Rafael Devers make his major-league debut and turn into a $300 million superstar. I was watching Kutter Crawford at (Florida Gulf Coast University). That guy's like a little brother to me. Even Nick Pivetta, he lived in southwest Florida and we had an entire offseason together. The list goes on and on. I could sit here and talk about (Alex Cora) for the next three hours. It is different.\"\n\nWhile there was some great memories, Sale would eventually be traded in December of 2023 along with cash considerations from the Red Sox to the Braves in exchange for Vaughn Grissom. This fueled the fire for Sale as he wanted to prove that even with all the criticism about his inability to stay healthy, he \"got after it\" according to ESPN.\n\n\"I went into the offseason on a mission,\" Sale said. \"I got after it, I knew I had to do it this year.\"\n\nRed Sox manager follows Sale even with the Braves\n\nSo far, he is living up to his goals as so far on the season, he has a 5-1 record, a 2.95 ERA, 52 strikeouts, and a 0.98 WHIP. Sale is looking to bolster what is already a great Atlanta team as they have championship aspirations of their own, but they will need the pitcher more than anything with the injury to Spencer Strider.\n\nIf there is someone who has been following Sale's young stint with the Braves, it has been Red Sox manager Alex Cora whom the two worked closely with each other. He even admitted before the two teams faced off that he does \"wish he was still with us and helping these kids to become big league players\" according to MassLive.com.\n\n\"I'm following. I knew a while ago he's pitching that day,\" Cora said. \"It's going to be great. We still have a job to do. Awkward? Of course. I wish he was still with us and helping these kids to become big league players and keep getting better. But understanding how it goes -- we have a good one (Grissom) and they have a good one. Very proud of him.\"\n\nCora uses NSFW response to address Sale's critics\n\nCora would talk in length about the critics of Sale and fight back the comments about his injury history and respond with an NSFW comment. He even mentioned the time when \"he broke his wrist riding his bicycle home after throwing at Boston College in August 2022 while working his way back from another injury.\"\n\n\"The guy is special,\" Cora said. \"I know people make jokes about him, the injuries and the bike and all that stuff, which I think is f****** bull-s*** because this guy did everything possible to be on the field.\"\n\nFor Cora, he is ecstatic about the next time the Red Sox face the Braves and more specifically Sale in Fenway Park so he can \"get the ovation he deserves.\" From the way the skipper is talking, there's no doubt that Sale has a coaching job in the future in Boston if he would want it.\n\n\"I can't wait for him to get back to Fenway and get the ovation he deserves,\" Cora said. \"Because out of all the guys here that have been part of this since 2018, all the way until now, he went through the ups and downs and he took his punches. But like I've said, nobody can take away that ring from '18.\"\n\nSale still in touch with the Red Sox program\n\nEven though he is providing some stellar innings for the Braves in their quest for the World Series, Cora said that Sale has \"been in touch\" and even \"helping our guys\" as he still talks to Red Sox stars like Kutter Crawford and Tanner Houck. Cora appreciates that even for players that are not in the franchise anymore, they are still involved somewhat as he talks about the work ethic of Sale and the great times the two had with one another.\n\n\"I'm very proud of him,\" Cora said. \"He's been in touch. He's been helping our guys, too. He talks to Kutter (Crawford) and to Tanner (Houck). He's in tune like everybody else. And that's the thing I take more pride of in my job -- like these guys are still part of the organization even from afar. They watch and they know what's going on. And that's pretty cool.\"\n\n\"I know how much work he had to put (in) to be out there every five days,\" Cora said. \"Last year, he made a point to show people what it takes to be a big leaguer. We had that outing in Kansas City. He was throwing like 85, 86 if I'm not mistaken. And he went 5 (innings). That was the game I went out with two outs and bases loaded or whatever -- he walked two guys -- and he was like, 'One more hitter?' And I say, 'Well, throw (expletive) strikes.' And it was 94, 95, 96. And he was like, 'You should have come out earlier.' But he cares about the players. He cared about the program. He still does. Since day one, that outing in Tampa, all the way to the last one last year in Baltimore, he was amazing. He is amazing.\"\n\nWhile Sale and Cora will appreciate the championship that was won in 2018 and even the other seasons with the Red Sox, the former is looking for more gold with the Braves. Atlanta is currently 22-12 on the season which puts them second behind the Philadelphia Phillies (26-12) as they now start a three-game series against the New York Mets starting Friday night.",

He drove one to the warning track in his final at-bat and heard chants of \"MVP! MVP!\" from the crowd at Truist Park.\n\nOzuna shrugged off the adulation, which is a far cry from a year ago when he was struggling badly and his time in Atlanta appeared to be winding down.\n\n\"Even if you do great, you have to be on the same level,\" he said. \"Don't get comfortable.\"\n\nSale (5-1) pitched for the Red Sox from 2018-23 -- a tenure that began with a World Series championship but was largely marred by injuries before he was traded to Atlanta this past winter.\n\nIt was strange facing his former team, but he quickly settled in.\n\n\"I respect those guys. I love those guys,\" Sale said. \"But we're here to win.\"\n\nThe left-hander sure seems to have regained the form that made him one of baseball's most dominant starters. He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\n\"I went into the offseason on a mission,\" Sale said, \"I got after it. I knew I had to do it this year.\"\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come. On this date a year ago, he was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBI, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this year.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole - a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season. He lasted four innings, giving up seven hits and all five Atlanta runs.\n\n\"Austin beating that ball out is a huge play,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"That gives us four runs, which is pretty much the difference in the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozuna", "type":

That includes his first start against his former team on Wednesday.\n\nSale pitched six scoreless innings, allowing six hits and one walk while striking out a season-high 10 batters.\n\nTwo of Boston's top offensive options had no answers for Sale and the two pitchers who came in after him, as Jarren Duran and Wilyer Abreu both struck out three times. The only player in the Red Sox lineup who didn't strike out on the night was catcher Connor Wong, who finished the game 2-for-4.\n\nWednesday was also the return of Nick Pivetta to the mound for Boston after a month off due to an elbow injury. He appeared to be a bit rusty, allowing five runs on seven hits and one walk, including three home runs.\n\nThe Red Sox are now just one game above .500 and just a half-game above the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL East.

John Bazemore/Associated Press\n\nATLANTA -- Marcell Ozuna's run-scoring single in the eighth inning gave Atlanta the lead and the Braves beat the Boston Red Sox 4-2 on Tuesday night to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWHO: Boston Red Sox (TBD) at Atlanta Braves (Sale 4-1)\n\nWHEN: 7:20 p.m. Wednesday\n\nTELEVISION: NESN\n\nBoston's Kutter Crawford and Atlanta's Reynaldo L\u00f3pez each allowed two runs in a matchup of right-handers with ERA's under 2.00.\n\nWith the game tied at 2, Boston right-hander Justin Slaten (2-1) walked Ozzie Albies and gave up a single to Austin Riley to open the eighth. With one out, Ozuna bounced a grounder through the infield to drive in Albies for a 3-2 lead. Riley advanced to third on the play and scored on Orlando Arcia's grounder to first, extending the lead to two runs.\n\nCrawford hit Travis d'Arnaud with a pitch in the third inning before Jarred Kelenic pulled a belt-high cutter 368 feet over the high right-field wall for a two-run homer, his first, giving Atlanta a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was only the second homer allowed in eight starts for Crawford, each coming in his last two starts.\n\nCrawford (1.56) and L\u00f3pez (1.50) began the night ranked among the ERA leaders in the majors for pitchers with at least five starts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nL\u00f3pez gave up at least one hit in each of his first five innings, but was effective in pitching out of trouble. Jaren Duran was stranded after leading off the game with a double and hitting a one-out triple in the fifth. L\u00f3pez struck out Rafael Devers and Tyler O'Neill to end the fifth.\n\nL\u00f3pez couldn't overcome three sixth-inning walks, including a bases-loaded pass to Reese McGuire that forced in a run. Ceddanne Rafaela's infield single off the back of left-hander Aaron Bummer's right knee, drove in Vaughn Grissom, who reached on shortstop Orlando Arcia's fielding error, for a 2-2 tie.\n\nAtlanta right-hander Joe Jim\u00e9nez (1-0) stranded two runners in the eighth when Adam Duvall made a sliding catch of Tyler O'Neill's drive toward the left-center gap to end the inning.\n\nRaisel Iglesias pitched a perfect ninth for his ninth save.\n\nNOTES: OF/DH Masataka Yoshida (left thumb strain), who was placed on the injured list on May 1, will have a second opinion on Wednesday. ... RHP Garrett Whitlock (left oblique strain) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment next week.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

He fanned 10 for the 82nd double-digit strikeout game of his career and got a big lift from left fielder Jarred Kelenic, who leaped above the yellow line at the 385-foot mark to snatch away a potential homer by Garrett Cooper.\n\nSpeaking of comebacks, look how far Ozuna has come.\n\nA year ago, the slugger known as \"Big Bear\" was hitting .146 and seemed on the verge of being released by the Braves. He rebounded to post 40 homers with 100 RBIs, and he's on pace for even loftier numbers this season.\n\nOzuna's second two-homer game of the year gave him 12 homers and 38 RBIs -- both tops in the big leagues -- along with a .315 batting average. He nearly made it three homers on the night, flying out to the warning track his final time up.\n\nOrlando Arcia also went deep for the Braves. Dylan Lee and Ray Kerr followed Sale to complete the seven-hit shutout.\n\nPivetta (1-2) made his first appearance since April 3 after being sidelined with a right elbow strain.\n\nHe appeared to get through the first with no trouble when Austin Riley hit into what was ruled an inning-ending double play. But the call was overturned when the replay showed Riley getting his foot to the bag just ahead of the relay throw.\n\nMatt Olson reached on a dribbler that went for an infield hit, and Ozuna followed with a 372-foot shot that barely cleared the right-field wall. Three pitches later, Arcia made it back-to-back homers with another opposite-field shot to right.\n\nInstead of getting out of the inning unscathed, Pivetta found himself in a 4-0 hole -- a rare slip-up by a Boston rotation that has been stellar this season.

However, he performed relatively well on the field, even if he wasn't playing like a seven-time All-Star.\n\nAcross his first six starts with the Braves, Sale has a 3.44 ERA and a 2.81 expected ERA boosted by a 29% strikeout rate (42 in 36 innings).\n\nHis velocity is up across his arsenal and he's suddenly missing bats at a near career-best level (15.4% swinging-strike rate).\n\nSale is a pitcher to buy for the foreseeable future, especially in a revenge spot.\n\nMeanwhile, Boston starting pitcher Nick Pivetta is finally healthy again, making his first start since April 3 after suffering a right elbow flexor strain.\n\nPivetta added a sweeper in June last season, and the new pitch mix transformed the much-maligned Canadian righty.\n\nHe's struck out 35% of batters since last July, the most among pitchers with at least 80 innings during the stretch.\n\nThe sweeper grades out highly by the advanced pitching model metrics (125 Stuff+ mark), but it's especially deadly when paired with his mid-90s high-rising fastball (20\" iVB, 99th percentile among starting pitchers).\n\nIt's always tough to battle Atlanta's hard-hitting lineup, but Pivetta might catch them at the right time. The Braves have posted a team .558 OPS over the past two weeks, the third-worst mark in baseball.\n\nI feel great about betting on a relatively lower-scoring ballgame between Sale, Pivetta and the slumping Braves.\n\nYesterday's Kutter Crawford-Reynaldo Lopez matchup ended 4-2 after the total closed at 8.5 and I'm expecting a similar game script today.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2151051599-e1715193115757.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1143, "textEnd": 1150}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

We fell short, yeah, but they put two on, we come back, they put two on, we come back. That says a lot about this ballclub.\n\n\"The Orioles came in here pretty hot, right? They're one of the best teams in baseball. They've got one of the best records, we could have easily -- they could have easily just said, 'Hey, we're down 3-1.' We don't do that, we keep fighting. And you saw it tonight. That should be a pretty good wake-up call for those guys that we can play with anybody.\n\n\"So, we're going to take a day off (Thursday) and rest. Hopefully, these guys will sleep and come back Friday and try to go 1-0 again.\"\n\nTanner Houck (3-3, 1.99 ERA) is scheduled to start on the mound for Boston. Houck's only career appearance against the Nationals came in 2021, when he pitched five perfect innings and struck out eight during Boston's 5-3 victory.\n\nHouck gave up four runs (three earned) on six hits in six innings during his last start, a 5-2 loss to Minnesota. He walked two and struck out five.\n\nFriday's game is the beginning of Boston's seven-game homestand.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sunherald.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cora", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Cora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Houck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Houck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Martinez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/25wxti/picture288440155/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/a92e2588-2d99-45b3-9f24-c7ead5cba091", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admitted to loving the organization and the guys he played with.\u00c2\n\nBut also, he was NOT going to lose this game.\u00c2\n\nSale was spectacular tonight, throwing six scoreless innings against his former team. Striking out a season-high ten batters, Sale allowed six hits and a walk but managed to always get out of any trouble. With runners on the corners and only one out in the 5th, Sale struck out the top of the Boston order (Jarren Duran, Rafael Devers) to strand both runners and get out of the jam.\u00c2\n\nFor the game, Sale finished with a season-high 20 whiffs (13 on the slider) and an absurd 39% CSW.\u00c2\n\nAtlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s designated hitter is riding a year-long streak of dominant offensive performance, one that started in early May of 2023 during a road series in Miami.\u00c2\n\nHe ascended to a new level in this one.\u00c2\n\nApparently frustrated that he was one homer shy of Shohei Ohtani for the MLB lead, Ozuna hit two bombs off of Nick Pivetta tonight. The first came in the opening frame, after the Braves won a challenge that overturned the tail end of an inning-ending double play. The second came in the 3rd inning, with Ozuna taking Pivetta deep again for a solo shot.\u00c2\n\nThe dual homers pushed Ozuna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MLB-leading RBI total to 38 and officially installed him as baseball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homer leader, as well, with 12.\u00c2\n\nOrlando Arcia went deep right after Ozuna in the first inning, his third of the year, pushing Atlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead to four runs early.\u00c2 \u00c2\n\nOrlando Arcia and Austin Riley have taken turns flashing the glove this season. Despite a late throwing error charged to Riley, the duo combined for multiple impressive plays in this one.\u00c2\n\nNot to be outdone, Jarred Kelenic continued his impressive defensive showing this season with a home run robbery of infielder Garrett Cooper in the top of the 6th.\u00c2\n\nAtlanta gets a second day off in the same week, traveling tonight after the game to New York to start a weekend series against the New York Mets. Atlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sending Charlie Morton to the mound on Friday versus Jose Quintana (7:10 PM), with Max Fried taking on prospect Christian Scott on Saturday (4:10 PM) and Bryce Elder

Braves Lineups: Nick Pivetta Returns From IL", "body": "The Red Sox will get two players back from the injured list against a familiar face in their series finale against the Braves.\n\nAtlanta took the opener after beating Boston, 4-2, at Truist Park. The Red Sox will get Nick Pivetta back from the IL, and he'll start opposite Chris Sale, who expressed his excitement to face his former team. Pivetta's last start was April 3 against the Oakland Athletics. The right-hander gave up zero runs off five hits and struck out three batters in five innings.\n\nRomy Gonz\u00e1lez also will make his return from the injured list. The 27-year-old's last game was April 10 against the Baltimore Orioles. Gonz\u00e1lez will start at first base and bat seventh in the order between Garrett Gooper, who moves to designated hitter, and Wilyer Abreu.\n\nConnor Wong rotates in at catcher, and he'll bat second ahead of Tyler O'Neill. Rafael Devers moves to the clean-up spot.\n\nFirst pitch for Red Sox-Braves is scheduled at 7:20 p.m. ET, and you can catch full coverage on NESN including an hour of pregame.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_ounpraseuth@nesn.com", "name": "Jason Ounpraseuth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truist_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truist Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Pivetta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Pivetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gio_Gonz\u00e1lez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gio Gonz\u00e1lez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NESN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Wong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Wong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_O'Neill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler O'Neill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Devers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Devers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/05/nick-pivetta-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544678", "eventUri": "eng-9544678", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 363, "textEnd": 370}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 594, "textEnd": 602}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 223707990, "title": "Strictly's Anton Du Beke keeps silent over joint Giovanni news leaving troubled star to fly solo", "text": "Strictly Come Dancing judge Anton Du Beke is keeping a low profile when it comes to shouting about a huge achievement with his pal Giovanni Pernice. The 57-year-old has been shortlisted for a prestigious National Television Award in the best factual category for his BBC travel documentary with Giovanni, 33, called \u2018Anton & Giovanni\u2019s Adventures\u2019. Last year saw the pro dancer pair get up to mischief in Sicily, while the most recent series follows their adventures in Spain. But while Giovanni took to Instagram in a bid to get viewers to vote for them \u2013 and even promised to get a tattoo of Anton\u2019s initials on his wrist if they won \u2013 Anton has refrained from posting anything about it on his social media accounts. It comes after reports Giovanni has sensationally quit Strictly after nine years earlier this month after accusations made against him. Giovanni's most recent dance partner Amanda Abbington is alleged to have quit the show after rowing with the professional in training. Other former celebrity dance partners are said to have made since made further claims about his treatment of them, all of which Giovanni strongly denies. The Italian dancer is now facing legal action from his former Strictly partners following \"abusive behaviour\" allegations, which prompted him to issue a statement on Instagram. Refuting any suggestion of \"abusive or threatening behaviour\", he wrote: \"To my dear fans, you will be as surprised as I am that allegations have been made about my dance teaching methods in the media this week. Of course, I reject any suggestion of abusive or threatening behaviour, and I look forward to clearing my name. \"Those who have followed my journey on Strictly Come Dancing over the last decade will know that I am passionate and competitive. No-one is more ambitious for my dance partners than me. I have always striven to help them be the very best dancers they can be. This has always come from a place of love and wanting to win - for me and my dance partners. Thank you all once again for your continued love and support! Giovanni.\" Giovanni is said to have instructed Joelle Rich, a partner in London-based law firm Schillings \u2013 who represented Johnny Depp during his 2020 libel battle against The Sun and has also represented Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \u2013 to represent him. The law firm will go head to head with Carter Ruck, the London law firm acting for Amanda and two other women. In the latest twist in the saga, it was reported this weekend that Giovanni asked BBC bosses to film all his training and rehearsals with Amanda after becoming concerned about her behaviour from week two, which is said to have left him \u201cworried\u201d and \u201cunsettled\u201d and feared she could case \u201ctrouble\u201d for him. The footage was reportedly reviewed daily by Strictly executives, who ruled none of his actions were inappropriate. Sherlock and Mr Selfridge star Amanda left the show in week five and is now pursuing a legal claim against Giovanni. Though when she allegedly leaked the recordings detail to the press, the fact it was Giovanni who requested their training sessions be taped in the first place was said to have been left out. A source told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cGio found the situation [with Amanda] very unsettling, so he asked that all sessions were recorded. It was totally unprecedented, but Gio started to see things in Amanda\u2019s behaviour and wanted to ensure he was protected. What a relief he did.\u201d The Mirror have approached reps for Giovanni and Amanda for further comment on this story.

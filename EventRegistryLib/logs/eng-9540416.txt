It's what the \"D\" in BDS stands for -- Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions -- a Palestinian-led international and nonviolent means of holding Israel accountable for decades of colonization, occupation, and war.\n\nNow, just as apartheid South Africa lost global prestige after U.S. university students successfully forced many universities to financially divest from the then-pariah state, there appears to be some momentum toward a parallel impact on Israel. The administration of the prestigious Brown University is the latest to have agreed to explore divestment from Israel in response to student demands.\n\nDivestment can mean different things depending on the nature of the institution's financial ties. But the idea behind it is simple: It means removing all financial ties, such as withdrawing investments, and therefore ending direct complicity in criminal and unjust actions. American institutions of higher learning are economic powerhouses with massive endowments, and ultimately can be described as \"big businesses.\" Many of them use their funds to directly or indirectly invest in Israel. Harvard University, for example, was found in 2020 to have invested nearly $200 million of its $40 billion endowment in companies with ties to Israel's occupation of Palestine.\n\nWhile the latest wave of student-led encampments is new in its scope, motivated especially by the horrors of Israel's latest wave of mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza, the student demands for divestment are not new. They are built on a decades-long foundation for protest constructed by an international solidarity movement in support of Palestinian liberation.\n\nThe BDS movement, launched by Palestinian unions and other civil society institutions in 2005, explains on its website that \"Israel is only able to maintain its oppressive regime over the Palestinian people and avoid accountability for its genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in the besieged and occupied Gaza Strip because of international state, corporate and institutional complicity.\"\n\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), with a long history of organized and coordinated boycott and divestment campaigns, has crafted helpful guidelines on how to divest, and has offered context for such efforts: \"[W]e recognize that the Israeli occupation is not the only illegal occupation in the world, although it is the longest and deadliest one.\" Moreover, according to AFSC, \"It is also the only place in the world from which a call was issued by the occupied people to the international community to use economic activism tools such as boycott and divestment to help end the occupation.\"\n\nColumbia University in New York, an epicenter of the current student-led campus actions, has a history of using divestment as a tool of protest that far predates the encampment launched by students on April 17. Although many media outlets cite Columbia's 1968 sit-ins against the Vietnam War as a parallel, Omar Barghouti, Tanaquil Jones, and Barbara Ransby wrote in The Guardian, that the university's 1985 anti-apartheid student sit-ins are even more relevant to today's protest. The Coalition for a Free South Africa successfully pushed Columbia University to divest from apartheid South Africa. Nearly three decades later, a campaign called Columbia Prison Divest also forced the university to pull investments from for-profit prison companies.\n\nAnd, four years ago, Columbia's undergraduate school, called Columbia College, passed a historic student vote calling for divestment from Israel. The list of campus divestment-related victories specific to Israel is surprisingly long. Nearly a decade ago, in 2015, the Associated Press called student-led divestment demands against Israel \"increasingly commonplace on many American college campuses.\"\n\nWhat's different today is that the pace of Israel's atrocities against Palestinians has significantly ramped up and is a bona fide genocide-in-progress, so much so that Israeli officials fear the International Criminal Court could issue arrest warrants against them. The official figures of Israel's victims in Gaza since last October number more than 34,000, with more than 40 percent of those being children. Israel has decimated so much of Gaza that authorities are unable to keep track of the dead, meaning the death toll is likely even higher.\n\nYoung people, including Jewish students, are deeply moved by Israel's savagery and the resulting Palestinian suffering. They are closely monitoring the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza on social media, forming digital ties with Palestinians, and grieving over the deaths of Gaza's children. It's only natural that they are pouring their rage toward the institutions they have the most proximity to and power over: The administrations of the schools where they pay exorbitant fees to attend, and that have invested in or partnered with Israel.\n\nUntil the tide fully turns against Israel for being an oppressive apartheid state, educational institutions will embrace it as a matter of pride. Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Central Florida, and University of Michigan are examples of schools that tout their collaborations with Israeli institutions. And there are Israeli efforts specifically aimed at legitimizing the colonial state at U.S. universities through donations of \"Israel bonds.\"\n\nWhether or not calls for divestment by the current student-led movement and the long-standing BDS movement succeed or have a concrete result, the symbolic impact of labeling Israel's actions as immoral can have a ripple effect, potentially discouraging schools from taking on such a controversial affiliation. The fact that students at Brown University, Northwestern University, and the University of Minnesota have successfully forced their schools' administrations to vote on divesting from Israel is a major step toward delegitimizing Israel. Smaller colleges such as the Seattle-based Evergreen State College are also following suit.\n\nDetractors of divestment say the efforts will have little effect on Israel. Others say they are antisemitic even though the initiatives are aimed at the Israeli state and institutions complicit in apartheid and genocide, not against Jewish individuals. Indeed, the current student movements in solidarity with Palestinians have the support and participation of many justice-seeking Jewish groups and individuals.\n\nMinnesota's congressional representative Ilhan Omar put it best in 2019 when the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the BDS movement. She said, \"We should condemn in the strongest terms violence that perpetuates the occupation, whether it is perpetuated by Israel, Hamas or individuals... But if we are going to condemn violent means of resisting the occupation, we cannot also condemn nonviolent means.\"", "source": {"uri": "southasiajournal.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "South

Here's what that means. - Poynter", "body": "Those calls have so far been denied, although some universities have agreed to enter into discussions with students.\n\nStudent protests against the Israel-Hamas war have roiled college campuses across the U.S. for weeks, with many protesters demanding divestment from companies with ties to Israel or weapons manufacturers.\n\nThose calls have so far been denied, although some universities have agreed to enter into discussions with students.\n\nBut what is divestment, exactly?\n\nAt New York's Columbia University, for example, protesters demand that the school redirect all of its money, including its endowment, away from companies and institutions that profit from what they call \"Israel apartheid, genocide and occupation in Palestine.\" The companies they say profit from those things include Google, Amazon and Airbnb.\n\nThe Palestine Solidarity Committee at the University of Texas at Austin has demanded the school rescind the millions of dollars it invests in companies that manufacture weapons, which it said are \"complicit in the genocide in Gaza.\" Similar demands were made at the university's Dallas campus by Students for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the past, pressure from students and other protesters has persuaded schools to divest from some industries, such as fossil fuels. Experts we spoke with said there's little evidence that divestment hurts targeted countries or businesses. They did say, though, that calls for divestment can be successful in raising public awareness about an issue, such as climate change or, in this case, the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\nJennifer Delaney, a University of California, Berkeley professor who studies higher education, said there's \"scant evidence\" that divestment limits the flow of resources to its intended target, but that divestment campaigns can effectively raise public consciousness about an issue.\n\n\"If the goal is to change the discourse around apartheid, climate change, and the current Israel-Hamas war, then this approach is effective,\" Delaney wrote in an email.\n\nProtesters are asking universities to sell off endowment investments in companies tied to the Israel conflict.\n\nEndowments are generally donation-supported investments that a school uses for long-term funding; they are often run by outside managers and invested in index, hedge or mutual funds. Endowment money is used to support teaching and research, and some endowments are worth tens of billions of dollars. Harvard University's endowment, for example, is valued at $50.7 billion. Columbia's stands at $13.64 billion.\n\nA 2023 fiscal year survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers showed that 688 participating colleges and universities had $839.1 billion in their endowments.\n\n\"Typically divestment campaigns focus on university endowments,\" because of their size and because many endowment funds are invested, Delaney said. \"It is possible to see divestment in other areas, like purchasing, contracts, capital (building), etc., but these have been used less frequently in national campaigns.\"\n\nNicholas Dirks, a University of California, Berkeley, history professor and the school's former chancellor, said endowments include money invested in stocks and bonds. The endowment principal is not \"spent down\" by the university, only the interest, he said. Depending on returns, the university will generally spend about 5% of the endowment annually, Dirks said.\n\nColumbia students have said they hope if their college divests from companies tied to Israel or weapons manufacturers, other institutions will follow suit.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik said in an April 29 statement that the university \"will not divest from Israel.\" The university has offered to have its Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing, which considers divestment matters, review new proposals from students.\n\nThe University of California in an April 26 statement said it has \"consistently opposed calls for boycotts against and divestment from Israel\" because it considers them impingements on academic freedom.\n\nWhile no schools have publicly agreed to divestment, Northwestern University and Brown University leaders agreed to give students more input on investments.\n\nUniversities have been receptive to calls for divestment in the past. Columbia in recent years has agreed not to invest in publicly traded oil, gas and coal companies, and to divest from the tobacco industry and private prisons. Harvard, after years of pressure, in 2021 announced it would no longer invest in the fossil fuel industry; now, less than 2% of its \"legacy investments\" remain in that industry, the Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported in March.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that divesting from companies tied to Israel or defense companies is possible, but likely complicated.\n\nFor one thing, it can be difficult to define what it means for a company to have ties to Israel, said Oliver Hart, a Harvard University economics professor.\n\n\"It's not well-defined. There are all sorts of links you could have to Israel, some direct, some indirect, some extremely small,\" Hart said.\n\nHe gave as an example calls in 2020 for Harvard to divest from Booking Holdings, the parent company of travel site Booking.com, because it listed among its available properties Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory.\n\n\"The vast majority of business that Booking.com does is outside Israel,\" Hart said.\n\nMany university endowments are invested in index funds or hedge funds. Index funds are a form of passive investment in which the fund mimics a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. The endowment manager doesn't choose the stocks or bonds in those funds. Hedge funds are actively managed funds that often make riskier investments in search of higher profits. Those investments are usually locked for a year before shares can be sold.\n\nTodd Ely, a University of Colorado Denver associate public affairs professor, said the more complicated the investment, the more difficult it is to divest.\n\n\"If a college or university invests in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, then it must sell the entire investment just to get rid of any exposure to one of the 500 companies in the index,\" he said.\n\nHedge fund and private equity investments can be even more difficult to untangle, he said.\n\n\"Such investments often include lock-up provisions that restrict exiting the investments for a specific period of time, are commingled with funds of other institutional investors, or even limit transparency into the detailed holdings,\" he said.\n\nLuigi Zingales, a University of Chicago professor of entrepreneurship and finance, said the difficulty level depends on the strictness of students' demands.\n\nIf students want schools to get out of all indexes that contain defense stock, \"this can be very costly and complicated,\" Zingales said. Asking venture capital or private equity companies not to invest in Israeli or defense stock could exclude schools from the most lucrative investments.\n\nDirks said divestment involving a country -- especially one with as many economic, political, cultural and military ties with the U.S. as Israel -- \"is very complex and highly difficult.\"\n\n\"Since many funds are held in index or hedge funds, it would mean combing through each discrete investment account, with its specific provisions about terms of investment and other externalities, and deciding whether to issue instructions to change the investment profile to each discrete manager and/or fund,\" Dirks said.\n\nOne endowment could potentially include hundreds or thousands of investments connected in some way to Israel, he said.\n\n\"Even if one found a clear and tidy set of definitions, it could take years to (divest) without significant harm to investment returns,\" Dirks said.\n\nStudent protesters and others seeking social change have for decades advocated for divestment from companies or countries they deem problematic.\n\nDelaney said there have been two significant divestment movements since the 1980s: One focused on divesting from South Africa during apartheid, and the other asked universities to divest from fossil fuels to address climate change.\n\nThose movements were able to achieve divestments, but if success \"means that they had an effect on the ultimate goal, there are doubts,\" Zingales said.\n\nHart was skeptical that divestment from companies doing business with South Africa played a significant role in apartheid's dismantling, saying the change was the result of many factors.\n\n\"I think the consensus is (that divestment activity) hasn't been very successful,\" Hart said.\n\nDirks said in South Africa, \"The amount of divestment was relatively small, and did not exercise a major impact on the dismantling of apartheid,\" but the pressure that came from disapproval of apartheid from the U.S. and other countries \"was intensified by decisions around divestment.\"\n\nBefore the current student protests, a nearly two-decade long movement known as BDS -- which stands for boycott, divest, sanctions -- has advocated for those actions related to Israel.\n\nBDS activists have called for institutions to divest from Israel-related holdings, boycott Israeli-made products and for governments to impose sanctions on Israel to weaken international support. Many student groups have embraced the BDS goals, but U.S. and state legislators have opposed sanctions and boycotts against Israel.\n\nZingales and Hart, along with Italy-based University of Trento economics professor Eleonora Broccardo, co-authored a 2022 study titled \"Exit versus Voice,\" which looks at the effectiveness of divestments and boycotts versus shareholder engagement with companies.\n\nHart told PolitiFact the study showed that having a voice in a company as a shareholder has more impact than divestment or boycott.\n\nShareholders, in principle, could move the needle by voting for a resolution that could persuade a company to change a policy, Hart said. Any cost of that change would be spread among shareholders.\n\nBy contrast, he said, divesting from a specific area could potentially harm an endowment's bottom line, and thus the university. Shares that an endowment sells are likely to be snapped up by others whose only motive is financial gain. A boycott would be more effective than divestment, Hart said, because if some people stop buying a company's products during a boycott, others aren't going to increase the amount they buy.\n\nHart said there could be a symbolic value in divesting from a company, such as tobacco manufacturers.\n\n\"Some people think that's just the right thing to do. They know it's not going to change the behavior of the cigarette companies, but they feel they would sully themselves by having any connection with the tobacco companies,\" Hart said. \"So I'm not denying that element, but as far as impact is concerned, the university will be hurt much more than the companies they are divesting from, or Israel.\"\n\nDelaney said targeted or impact investing is another method of affecting change that is growing in popularity. Instead of investing in a general mutual fund, individuals can make investments tied to social causes.\n\n\"The growth in popularity of these investment tools indicates a belief that targeted investing can be effective,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "poynter.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poynter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_cercone@poynter.org", "name": "Jeff Cercone", "type":

Today's campus protests against Israel are building on that movement.\n\nThe student-led movement against the genocide in Gaza that is sweeping college campuses across the United States, has made \"divestment\" from Israel central to its demands. It's what the \"D\" in BDS stands for -- Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions -- a Palestinian-led international and nonviolent means of holding Israel accountable for decades of colonization, occupation, and war.\n\nNow, just as apartheid South Africa lost global prestige after U.S. university students successfully forced many universities to financially divest from the then-pariah state, there appears to be some momentum toward a parallel impact on Israel. The administration of the prestigious Brown University is the latest to have agreed to explore divestment from Israel in response to student demands.\n\nDivestment can mean different things depending on the nature of the institution's financial ties. But the idea behind it is simple: It means removing all financial ties, such as withdrawing investments, and therefore ending direct complicity in criminal and unjust actions. American institutions of higher learning are economic powerhouses with massive endowments, and ultimately can be described as \"big businesses.\" Many of them use their funds to directly or indirectly invest in Israel. Harvard University, for example, was found in 2020 to have invested nearly $200 million of its $40 billion endowment in companies with ties to Israel's occupation of Palestine.\n\nWhile the latest wave of student-led encampments is new in its scope, motivated especially by the horrors of Israel's latest wave of mass ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza, the student demands for divestment are not new. They are built on a decades-long foundation for protest constructed by an international solidarity movement in support of Palestinian liberation.\n\nThe BDS movement, launched by Palestinian unions and other civil society institutions in 2005, explains on its website that \"Israel is only able to maintain its oppressive regime over the Palestinian people and avoid accountability for its genocide against 2.3 million Palestinians in the besieged and occupied Gaza Strip because of international state, corporate and institutional complicity.\"\n\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), with a long history of organized and coordinated boycott and divestment campaigns, has crafted helpful guidelines on how to divest, and has offered context for such efforts: \"[W]e recognize that the Israeli occupation is not the only illegal occupation in the world, although it is the longest and deadliest one.\" Moreover, according to AFSC, \"It is also the only place in the world from which a call was issued by the occupied people to the international community to use economic activism tools such as boycott and divestment to help end the occupation.\"\n\nColumbia University in New York, an epicenter of the current student-led campus actions, has a history of using divestment as a tool of protest that far predates the encampment launched by students on April 17. Although many media outlets cite Columbia's 1968 sit-ins against the Vietnam War as a parallel, Omar Barghouti, Tanaquil Jones, and Barbara Ransby wrote in The Guardian, that the university's 1985 anti-apartheid student sit-ins are even more relevant to today's protest. The Coalition for a Free South Africa successfully pushed Columbia University to divest from apartheid South Africa. Nearly three decades later, a campaign called Columbia Prison Divest also forced the university to pull investments from for-profit prison companies.\n\nAnd, four years ago, Columbia's undergraduate school, called Columbia College, passed a historic student vote calling for divestment from Israel. The list of campus divestment-related victories specific to Israel is surprisingly long. Nearly a decade ago, in 2015, the Associated Press called student-led divestment demands against Israel \"increasingly commonplace on many American college campuses.\"\n\nWhat's different today is that the pace of Israel's atrocities against Palestinians has significantly ramped up and is a bona fide genocide-in-progress, so much so that Israeli officials fear the International Criminal Court could issue arrest warrants against them. The official figures of Israel's victims in Gaza since last October number more than 34,000, with more than 40 percent of those being children. Israel has decimated so much of Gaza that authorities are unable to keep track of the dead, meaning the death toll is likely even higher.\n\nYoung people, including Jewish students, are deeply moved by Israel's savagery and the resulting Palestinian suffering. They are closely monitoring the indiscriminate bombing of Gaza on social media, forming digital ties with Palestinians, and grieving over the deaths of Gaza's children. It's only natural that they are pouring their rage toward the institutions they have the most proximity to and power over: The administrations of the schools where they pay exorbitant fees to attend, and that have invested in or partnered with Israel.\n\nUntil the tide fully turns against Israel for being an oppressive apartheid state, educational institutions will embrace it as a matter of pride. Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Central Florida, and University of Michigan are examples of schools that tout their collaborations with Israeli institutions. And there are Israeli efforts specifically aimed at legitimizing the colonial state at U.S. universities through donations of \"Israel bonds.\"\n\nWhether or not calls for divestment by the current student-led movement and the long-standing BDS movement succeed or have a concrete result, the symbolic impact of labeling Israel's actions as immoral can have a ripple effect, potentially discouraging schools from taking on such a controversial affiliation. The fact that students at Brown University, Northwestern University, and the University of Minnesota have successfully forced their schools' administrations to vote on divesting from Israel is a major step toward delegitimizing Israel. Smaller colleges such as the Seattle-based Evergreen State College are also following suit.\n\nDetractors of divestment say the efforts will have little effect on Israel. Others say they are antisemitic even though the initiatives are aimed at the Israeli state and institutions complicit in apartheid and genocide, not against Jewish individuals. Indeed, the current student movements in solidarity with Palestinians have the support and participation of many justice-seeking Jewish groups and individuals.\n\nMinnesota's congressional representative Ilhan Omar put it best in 2019 when the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the BDS movement. She said, \"We should condemn in the strongest terms violence that perpetuates the occupation, whether it is perpetuated by Israel, Hamas or individuals... But if we are going to condemn violent means of resisting the occupation, we cannot also condemn nonviolent means.\"", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia

Here's what that means.", "body": "Student protests against the Israel-Hamas war have roiled college campuses across the U.S. for weeks, with many protesters demanding divestment from companies with ties to Israel or weapons manufacturers.\n\nThose calls have so far been denied, although some universities have agreed to enter into discussions with students.\n\nBut what is divestment, exactly?\n\nAt New York's Columbia University, for example, protesters demand that the school redirect all of its money, including its endowment, away from companies and institutions that profit from what they call \"Israel apartheid, genocide and occupation in Palestine.\" The companies they say profit from those things include Google, Amazon and Airbnb.\n\nThe Palestine Solidarity Committee at the University of Texas at Austin has demanded the school rescind the millions of dollars it invests in companies that manufacture weapons, which it said are \"complicit in the genocide in Gaza.\" Similar demands were made at the university's Dallas campus by Students for Justice in Palestine.\n\nIn the past, pressure from students and other protesters has persuaded schools to divest from some industries, such as fossil fuels. Experts we spoke with said there's little evidence that divestment hurts targeted countries or businesses. They did say, though, that calls for divestment can be successful in raising public awareness about an issue, such as climate change or, in this case, the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.\n\nJennifer Delaney, a University of California, Berkeley professor who studies higher education, said there's \"scant evidence\" that divestment limits the flow of resources to its intended target, but that divestment campaigns can effectively raise public consciousness about an issue.\n\n\"If the goal is to change the discourse around apartheid, climate change, and the current Israel-Hamas war, then this approach is effective,\" Delaney wrote in an email.\n\nWhat does divestment mean when it comes to universities?\n\nProtesters are asking universities to sell off endowment investments in companies tied to the Israel conflict.\n\nEndowments are generally donation-supported investments that a school uses for long-term funding; they are often run by outside managers and invested in index, hedge or mutual funds. Endowment money is used to support teaching and research, and some endowments are worth tens of billions of dollars. Harvard University's endowment, for example, is valued at $50.7 billion. Columbia's stands at $13.64 billion.\n\nA 2023 fiscal year survey by the National Association of College and University Business Officers showed that 688 participating colleges and universities had $839.1 billion in their endowments.\n\n\"Typically divestment campaigns focus on university endowments,\" because of their size and because many endowment funds are invested, Delaney said. \"It is possible to see divestment in other areas, like purchasing, contracts, capital (building), etc., but these have been used less frequently in national campaigns.\"\n\nNicholas Dirks, a University of California, Berkeley history professor and the school's former chancellor, said endowments include money invested in stocks and bonds. The endowment principal is not \"spent down\" by the university, only the interest, he said. Depending on returns, the university will generally spend about 5% of the endowment annually, Dirks said.\n\nColumbia students have said they hope if their college divests from companies tied to Israel or weapons manufacturers, other institutions will follow suit.\n\nHow have colleges responded?\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik said in an April 29 statement that the university \"will not divest from Israel.\" The university has offered to have its Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing, which considers divestment matters, review new proposals from students.\n\nThe University of California in an April 26 statement said it has \"consistently opposed calls for boycotts against and divestment from Israel\" because it considers them impingements on academic freedom.\n\nWhile no schools have publicly agreed to divestment, Northwestern University and Brown University leaders agreed to give students more input on investments.\n\nUniversities have been receptive to calls for divestment in the past. Columbia in recent years has agreed not to invest in publicly traded oil, gas and coal companies, and to divest from the tobacco industry and private prisons. Harvard, after years of pressure, in 2021 announced it would no longer invest in the fossil fuel industry; now, less than 2% of its \"legacy investments\" remain in that industry, the Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported in March.\n\nHow complicated is divesting from Israel?\n\nExperts told PolitiFact that divesting from companies tied to Israel or defense companies is possible but probably complicated.\n\nFor one thing, it can be difficult to define what it means for a company to have ties to Israel, said Oliver Hart, a Harvard University economics professor.\n\n\"It's not well-defined. There are all sorts of links you could have to Israel, some direct, some indirect, some extremely small,\" Hart said.\n\nHe gave as an example calls in 2020 for Harvard to divest from Booking Holdings, the parent company of travel site Booking.com, because it listed among its available properties Jewish settlements in Palestinian territory.\n\n\"The vast majority of business that Booking.com does is outside Israel,\" Hart said.\n\nMany university endowments are invested in index funds or hedge funds. Index funds are a form of passive investment in which the fund mimics a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. The endowment manager doesn't choose the stocks or bonds in those funds. Hedge funds are actively managed funds that often make riskier investments in search of higher profits. Those investments are usually locked for a year before shares can be sold.\n\nTodd Ely, a University of Colorado Denver associateprofessor of public affairs, said the more complicated the investment, the more difficult it is to divest.\n\n\"If a college or university invests in an index fund that tracks the S&P 500, then it must sell the entire investment just to get rid of any exposure to one of the 500 companies in the index,\" he said.\n\nHedge fund and private equity investments can be even more difficult to untangle, he said.\n\n\"Such investments often include lock-up provisions that restrict exiting the investments for a specific period of time, are commingled with funds of other institutional investors, or even limit transparency into the detailed holdings,\" he said.\n\nLuigi Zingales, a University of Chicago professor of entrepreneurship and finance, said the difficulty level depends on the strictness of students' demands.\n\nIf students want schools to get out of all indexes that contain defense stock, \"this can be very costly and complicated,\" Zingales said. Asking venture capital or private equity companies not to invest in Israeli or defense stock could exclude schools from the most lucrative investments.\n\nDirks said divestment involving a country -- especially one with as many economic, political, cultural and military ties with the U.S. as Israel -- \"is very complex and highly difficult.\"\n\n\"Since many funds are held in index or hedge funds, it would mean combing through each discrete investment account, with its specific provisions about terms of investment and other externalities, and deciding whether to issue instructions to change the investment profile to each discrete manager and/or fund,\" Dirks said.\n\nOne endowment could include hundreds or thousands of investments connected in some way to Israel, he said.\n\n\"Even if one found a clear and tidy set of definitions, it could take years to (divest) without significant harm to investment returns,\" Dirks said.\n\nThe track record of calls for divestment\n\nStudent protesters and others seeking social change have for decades advocated for divestment from companies or countries they deem problematic.\n\nDelaney said there have been two significant divestment movements since the 1980s: One focused on divesting from South Africa during apartheid, and the other asked universities to divest from fossil fuels to address climate change.\n\nThose movements were able to achieve divestments, but if success \"means that they had an effect on the ultimate goal, there are doubts,\" Zingales said.\n\nHart was skeptical that divestment from companies doing business with South Africa played a significant role in apartheid's dismantling, saying the change was the result of many factors.\n\n\"I think the consensus is (that divestment activity) hasn't been very successful,\" Hart said.\n\nDirks said that in South Africa, \"the amount of divestment was relatively small and did not exercise a major impact on the dismantling of apartheid,\" but the pressure that came from disapproval of apartheid from the U.S. and other countries \"was intensified by decisions around divestment.\"\n\nBefore the current student protests, a nearly two-decade-long movement known as BDS -- which stands for boycott, divest, sanctions -- has advocated for those actions related to Israel.\n\nBDS activists have called for institutions to divest from Israel-related holdings and boycott Israeli-made products and for governments to impose sanctions on Israel to weaken international support. Many student groups have embraced the BDS goals, but U.S. and state legislators have opposed sanctions and boycotts against Israel.\n\nDivestment versus shareholder engagement\n\nZingales and Hart, along with Italy-based University of Trento economics professor Eleonora Broccardo, co-authored a 2022 study titled \"Exit versus Voice,\" which looks at the effectiveness of divestments and boycotts versus shareholder engagement with companies.\n\nHart told PolitiFact the study showed that having a voice in a company as a shareholder has more impact than divestment or boycott.\n\nShareholders, in principle, could move the needle by voting for a resolution that could persuade a company to change a policy, Hart said. Any cost of that change would be spread among shareholders.\n\nBy contrast, he said, divesting from a specific area could harm an endowment's bottom line, and thus the university. Shares that an endowment sells are likely to be snapped up by others whose only motive is financial gain. A boycott would be more effective than divestment, Hart said, because if some people stop buying a company's products during a boycott, others aren't going to increase the amount they buy.\n\nHart said there could be a symbolic value in divesting from a company, such as tobacco manufacturers.\n\n\"Some people think that's just the right thing to do. They know it's not going to change the behavior of the cigarette companies, but they feel they would sully themselves by having any connection with the tobacco companies,\" Hart said. \"So I'm not denying that element, but as far as impact is concerned, the university will be hurt much more than the companies they are divesting from, or Israel.\"\n\nDelaney said targeted or impact investing is another method of effecting change that is growing in popularity. Instead of investing in a general mutual fund, individuals can make investments tied to social causes.\n\n\"The growth in popularity of these investment tools indicates a belief that targeted investing can be effective,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "eu.statesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA TODAY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_american_statesman@eu.statesman.com", "name":

Students have also started to ask their universities to divest from any U.S. company that does business in Israel. That includes companies that produce weapons and aircraft that can be used in war, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. In addition, some protesters say schools should end investments in technology companies such as Google and Airbnb that do business in Israel.\n\nFor weeks, protesters have been calling for the war between Hamas and Israel to end. The war started in 2023 after Hamas fighters invaded Israel and killed about 1200 people and took hostages. Israel's military fight against Hamas has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, Hamas' health ministry said.\n\nProtesters began calling for divestment from Israel in the months following the start of the war. At Columbia, a group calling itself Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) published demands. CUAD has demanded that the university: \"Divest all of Columbia's finances, including the endowment, from companies and institutions that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide and occupation in Palestine. Ensure accountability by increasing transparency around financial investments.\"\n\nAn endowment is a special organization that invests money for the school that creates it. The people who work for it have a legal responsibility to invest the money wisely. The gains are supposed to pay for improvements to the school grounds, new buildings and to provide financial aid for students.\n\nEffects of recent divestment calls\n\nSome universities are agreeing to consider changing the way they invest money in their endowments. Others are not.\n\nOn April 30 at Brown, leaders said they would discuss and vote on selling investments related to Israel's fighting in Gaza if the protesters left their encampment. The protesters agreed.\n\nOne student group at Brown, the Brown Divest Coalition, posted a message on Instagram celebrating the deal:\n\n\"This would not have been possible without the hard work of university encampments across the country whose collective power has forced university administrators to acknowledge the overwhelming support for Palestine...\"\n\nAt the University of California, Berkeley, the BDS Coalition demanded: \"The total divestment of the UC Berkeley Foundation and the UC General Endowment Pool from the Israeli state and from all companies profiting from the colonization of Palestine.\"\n\nBut on April 26, the University of California said it would not change its investments. A statement said: \"The University of California has consistently opposed calls for boycott against and divestment from Israel...\"\n\nAt Columbia, the place that many see as the starting point of the protests that spread across the U.S., the university offered to talk with protesters. Columbia said it would publish a list of the school's direct investments and increase how often the list is updated. The school's investing committee said it would consider proposals from students.\n\nPast success from divestment\n\nStudents involved in recent protests point to similar calls for divestment from South Africa that started in the 1980s. At the time, South Africa was a segregated country living under what was known as apartheid. Civil rights activists point to economic pressure around the world, some of which came from universities, as a main reason for the end of the policy in the 1990s.\n\nBut some business and education experts note that university endowments are more sophisticated than they were back then.\n\nThe Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics reported that the combined market value of the 20 largest U.S. university endowments totaled more than $927 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nIs divestment possible?\n\nMuch of the money in endowments is overseen by financial professionals who have permission to buy and sell stocks or groups of stocks.\n\nBecause of this, it can be difficult to identify a school's involvement with a company. Georges Dyer is executive director and cofounder of the Intentional Endowments Network.\n\n\"It's not as simple as some people think -- maybe it's just selling some stocks at a certain company,\" Dyer said.\n\nFinancial experts also note that a small number of universities removing their investments in a few large companies such as Boeing or Microsoft will not make much difference.\n\nTodd Ely is an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado, Denver. He said some schools likely have employed financial companies to supervise their investments and \"colleges and universities have fairly limited discretion in the actual...investments.\"\n\nWill calls for divestment end the war?\n\nDany Bahar and Natan Sachs of the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. have done research on divestment. They noted that divestment movements have had little effect on the Israeli economy.\n\nIn their writing, they note that only official restrictions, or sanctions, by the United States, would produce economic pressure to change Israeli policy. But that is not likely to happen because of U.S. support for Israel.\n\nJust on Thursday, President Joe Biden talked about his support for the protesters' right to express themselves, but said the U.S. does not plan to end its support for Israel's fight against Hamas.\n\nVOA's Rob Garver wrote this story. Dan Friedell adapted it for Learning English and included material from the Associated Press.\n\nendowment -n. a legal structure designed to supervise and grow things of value for the gain of the

He added that his organization's goal was to end Israel's military occupation, the system of racial domination... and to defend the UN-sanctioned right of return of Palestinian refugees.\n\nOver the weekend, Vassar College in New York announced it would consider a proposal to divest from defense-related investments, but did not commit to taking action.\n\nMeanwhile, protests continued across the country. Pro-Palestinian activists disrupted graduation and admissions ceremonies on several campuses over the weekend, and police arrested dozens of other demonstrators, including at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDaniel Diermeier, president of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, which took early action to sue students who occupied a building in March calling for divestment, said: Our investment committee has a clear policy of not divestment for political reasons. It is inconsistent with our values to boycott specific entities or countries. This would violate our institutional neutrality.\n\nHe said his legal advisers had warned that doing so could violate federal laws prohibiting boycotts with countries friendly to the United States. He said Tennessee state law is even stricter. We are not allowed there. If we did, we would lose significant public funding. This would be a serious risk for the university. Our legal analysis is that there is no valid challenge to the law.\n\nSome question divestment for more practical reasons. Usha Haley, a professor at Wichita State University who studied anti-apartheid boycotts in South Africa in the 1960s and 1980s, said: \"The boycotts and sanctions had minimal effect on the operations of the multinationals and have actually diminished the influence of the boycotters.\n\nSince then, the increased use of private equity vehicles and investment funds managed by endowments has increased the opacity of stock holdings as well as the difficulty of divesting them.\n\nGeorges Dyer, executive director of the International Endowments Network, which supports investment in a low-carbon economy, said: \"The move to external managers and combined funds can make this very difficult, and there has real costs and associated fees. But everything is possible.\n\nHe said that while geopolitical calls for divestment such as those against Israel might not impose significant financial sanctions on targeted companies, they could have a signaling impact and be a political driver for change.\n\nMinouche Shafik, Columbia's president, said this week that the university had proposed a mechanism to disclose direct investments and review student requests through its Socially Responsible Investment Advisory Committee, but also stressed that the university would not disengage from Israel.\n\nOther U.S. universities, including Brown, Northwestern, Rutgers and Minnesota, which have negotiated with protesters in recent days, have agreed to similar processes without committing to divestment.\n\nSheldon Pollock, a retired Columbia professor who participated in discussions on fossil fuel divestment, said: There is a history of socially responsible divestment at Columbia. He has divested from tobacco, weapons, private prisons and South Africa.\n\nBut he said professors had not been involved in recent discussions with protesters and that the administration had lost all legitimacy and that it was not entirely clear that students had a negotiating partner in good faith.\n\nAdam Tooze, a Columbia professor, recently cited a study showing the lack of transparency in university finances, and suggested that pressure from donors could cause the administration to be reluctant to discuss divestment.\n\nBarghouti said BDS strategically focuses on a relatively small number of complicit companies and products carefully selected for maximum impact...that play a clear and direct role in Israeli crimes and where there is real potential for victory. This included arms companies supplying military equipment to Israel.\n\nIts current list of targets includes Israeli arms supplier Elbit Systems and Hikvision, a Chinese manufacturer of video surveillance systems, but also multinationals including Intel, Chevron and HD Hyundai, Volvo, CAT and JCB, which BDS says supply machines used to clean up Palestinian settlements.\n\nRecommended\n\nThe movement also targets Barclays, one of the hotbeds of the anti-apartheid boycott against South Africa in the 1980s that inspired BDS, which it says has lent more than $3 billion and holds more than $1 billion actions of nine military suppliers whose products were used in Israel. forces.\n\nIndividual student groups, including the Columbia University Apartheid Divest, have cited a longer list of companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, from which they seek to divest.\n\nVolvo and Intel did not respond to requests for comment. Barclays referred to a briefing paper published ahead of its annual general meeting next week which says the claims are incorrect because its holdings are owned by its customers and not the bank itself.\n\nHe said governments should regulate and decide the rules regarding arms deliveries, and that the defense sector as a whole is an important contributor to our security. It supplies equipment to a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom and other European NATO members, and more recently Ukraine.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance

He added that his organisation's aim was \"ending Israel's military occupation, system of racial domination\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and upholding the UN-sanctioned right of Palestinian refugees to return\".\n\nHowever, Daniel Diermeier, president of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, which took early action to prosecute students who occupied a building in March calling for divestment, said: \"Our investment committee has a clear policy not to divest for political reasons. It is inconsistent with our values to engage in boycotting specific entities or countries. That would violate our institutional neutrality.\"\n\nHe added that his legal advisers had cautioned doing so could breach federal laws preventing boycotts with countries friendly to the US. He said Tennessee state law was even more strict. \"We are not allowed to. If we did, we would lose significant state funding. That would be a serious risk for the university. Our legal analysis is that there is no valid challenge to the law.\"\n\nSome question divestment on more practical grounds. Usha Haley, a professor at Wichita State University who studied the anti-apartheid boycotts of South Africa in the 1960s-80s, said: \"Boycotts and sanctions had minimal effect on multinationals' operations and actually lessened the influence of the boycotters.\"\n\nSince then, greater use of private equity vehicles and managed investment funds by endowments have increased the opacity of stock holdings along with the difficulty in divesting from them.\n\nGeorges Dyer, executive director of the International Endowments Network, which supports investments in a low-carbon economy, said: \"The move to external managers and combined funds can make it very challenging, and there are real costs and associated fees. But anything is possible.\"\n\nHe said while geopolitical divestment calls such as those against Israel might not impose a significant financial penalty on targeted companies, they could have \"a signalling impact and be a political driver\" for change.\n\nMinouche Shafik, Columbia's president, said this week that the university had proposed a mechanism for disclosing direct investments and reviewing student demands through its Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing, but also stressed \"the university will not divest from Israel\".\n\nOther US universities, including Brown, Northwestern, Rutgers and Minnesota, which have negotiated with protesters in recent days, have agreed similar processes without committing to divestment.\n\nSheldon Pollock, a retired professor at Columbia who was involved in discussions on divestment from fossil fuels, said: \"There is a history of socially responsible divestment at Columbia. It divested from tobacco, guns, private prisons and South Africa.\"\n\nBut he said faculty had not been involved in recent discussions with protesters and said \"the administration has lost all legitimacy and it's not entirely clear that the students had a good faith negotiating partner\".\n\nAdam Tooze, a professor at Columbia, recently cited a study showing the lack of transparency in the university's finances, and suggested pressure from donors may be driving the administration's resistance to discuss divestment.\n\nBarghouti said BDS \"strategically focuses on a relatively smaller number of carefully selected complicit companies and products for maximum impact\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that play a clear and direct role in Israel's crimes and where there is real potential for winning\". That included arms companies supplying military equipment to Israel.\n\nIts current \"targeted list\" includes the Israeli arms supplier Elbit Systems and Hikvision, a Chinese manufacturer of CCTV systems, but also multinationals, including Intel, Chevron and HD Hyundai, Volvo, CAT and JCB, which BDS says provide machinery used to clear Palestinian settlements.\n\nThe movement also targets Barclays, a focus of the anti-apartheid boycott against South Africa in the 1980s that inspired BDS, which it says has lent more than \u00a33bn and holds more than \u00a31bn in shares of nine military suppliers whose products have been used in Israel's forces.\n\nIndividual student groups, including Columbia University Apartheid Divest, have cited a longer list of companies, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, from which they seek divestment.\n\nVolvo and Intel did not reply to requests to comment. Barclays referred to a briefing document released ahead of its annual general meeting next week, which said the claims were mistaken, because its shareholdings were those of its customers rather than the bank itself.\n\nIt said governments should regulate and decide rules around weapon deliveries, and that \"the defence sector overall is an important contributor to our security. It provides equipment to a wide range of countries including the UK and other European Nato members, and more recently Ukraine.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial

Endowments are typically invested in various things, such as stocks or real estate, to grow the funds available at the university's disposal over time.\n\nThe largest university endowment in the United States belongs to Harvard University, which had a roughly $50.9 billion endowment for fiscal 2022, according to the U.S. News and World Report.\n\nAndrew Gillen, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Texas Public Policy Foundation, told the outlet that endowments are essentially a \"super-charged rainy-day fund,\" adding that typically, funds are managed by the school or by a group closely tied to the university.\n\nWhy are the endowments secretive?\n\nEndowments are in place at private universities, and because of this, they are not subject to the same transparency as public universities. Private schools, like Columbia, tend to keep financial information vague and publish only select financial reports annually.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTypically, specific investments are not known by most, as the endowments are typically run by investment managers and the school's board of trustees. The investments are typically made with the goal of helping grow the endowment.\n\n\"Colleges and universities have fairly limited discretion in the actual specific investments that their endowment funds are going towards because they've hired these external experts to make those decisions. And sometimes those decisions are even proprietary,\" Todd Ely, associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, told the Associated Press last month.\n\nWhy is there interest from anti-Israel protesters?\n\nAnti-Israel protesters have latched on to the divestment goals of groups opposed to the Jewish state's treatment of Palestinians. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement is one of the largest groups opposed to Israel and works to pressure companies and groups to shun Israel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSeveral protesters have drawn parallels to student-led movements in the 1980s, which pushed universities to divest from apartheid South Africa. The impact of divestment from South Africa by some universities has been debated, with its effect unclear decades later.\n\nOther recent divestment campaigns have included students demanding universities divest from fossil fuels, but that has been difficult for similar reasons.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

But is cutting such financial ties even possible? And even if it were, would the loss of colleges' investments actually change the bottom line for businesses operating in the region or providing arms for the conflict?\n\nInstitutions of higher education hold close to $1 trillion in their endowments, much of it parked in index funds, hedge funds, and private-equity funds that invest in equities, bonds, derivatives, real estate, start-ups, and so on. They do not generally make individual investments themselves, meaning that divestment would not be as simple as executing a few stock orders.\n\nThat does not mean they have no say over where their money is going, however. Many universities already can claim that they avoid pouring money into industries that damage the planet or hurt people. In one survey of 688 schools with endowments, 187 said they had a \"responsible investment strategy.\" Many put their cash in \"ESG\" funds that invest only in firms committed to meeting environmental and social standards (such as measuring their carbon output and reporting on the gender and racial balance of their workforce). Other endowments engage in \"impact investing,\" pushing cash to for-profit enterprises working for the common good (such as ones building homes, grocery stores, and schools in low-income neighborhoods). Still others bar investment in gambling and tobacco.\n\nPlus, universities have divested before. In the 1980s, protesters at schools around the country formed encampments and demanded divestment from businesses operating in apartheid South Africa. Many schools agreed. (Endowments were smaller and simpler then.) In the past decade, scores of colleges and universities -- including Columbia, Brown, and Harvard -- have divested from fossil-fuel firms after being petitioned by campus activists; others pulled money out of Russia after its incursion into Ukraine; others divested from private prisons and the retailers of assault weapons.\n\nDivestment from Israel would not be straightforward. It might not be immediate. (And at least one state, Ohio, has a law barring its public universities from divesting from Israel.) But it is certainly possible, Charlie Eaton, a sociologist at UC Merced who studies university endowments, told me. \"If you're a Columbia or a Brown or a Princeton or a Harvard, you have a lot of leverage as a very large investor. If you've got an endowment that's valued in the tens of billions of dollars, you can find somebody who will manage the funds according to your preferences.\"\n\nIf schools chose to do this, they would face little financial risk. Their investments are so big that pulling back from arms manufacturers and Israeli companies, a tiny share of the global economy, would do essentially nothing to their bottom line.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: If you're worried about the climate, move your money\n\nThe specific decisions a college would have to make are more complicated. Schools could divest from Israeli firms and military contractors around the world if they actually wanted to. But what about firms with major operations in Israel? Firms whose wares or services are purchased by the Israel Defense Forces? Some students at Columbia argue that the school should drop its investments in all companies \"profiting from Israeli apartheid,\" including Amazon, Airbnb, Hyundai, and Google, among others.\n\nA yet-bigger question is whether divestment would do anything. In terms of changing the financial outlook for the firms being called out, the clear answer is no, not much. The old investing chestnut applies: For every seller, there is a buyer. If University A sells its shares in military contractor B and Israeli technology firm C, pension fund D is going to pick them up. Unless a huge share of the world's investors refuses to put money into the companies in question, share prices and financing costs won't be impacted much. Indeed, studies of ESG investing show no effect on a company's expected returns. The South Africa divestment campaign did not seem to do much either.\n\nThat said, some studies of fossil-fuel divestment show a small, but measurable, effect. Divestment has reduced the share price of American coal companies, for instance. The world's financiers came to see investing in coal as riskier, in essence, and lower returns as likelier.\n\nStill, this kind of analysis misses the point. Most students understand that divestment would not bring down the Israeli economy or end the war. Their goal is not really a financial one but a political one: They don't want their universities supporting Israel or associated with the human tragedy in Gaza. They oppose the war.\n\nLikewise, the real opposition to divestment is political, not technical. Most Americans believe that Israel has a valid reason to be targeting Hamas; the country is split on whether the campaign of bombardment itself is justified. Many donors to colleges and universities find the protests anti-Semitic, and support Israel, and don't want to see administrators give in. Some are even promising to quit giving money to their alma maters if the schools divest.\n\nUniversity administrators, for their part, seem to be searching for ways to make everyone happy, by promising to study the issue or hold votes on their investment strategies. Brown committed to meet with a divestment coalition. The University of Minnesota agreed to share more information about its holdings. It seems unlikely that much will come from these initiatives. But if colleges felt compelled to divest, they could certainly do so.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The students renamed the building Hind's Hall, in honor of 6-year-old Hind Rajab who was killed by the Israeli military during its brutal assault on Gaza.\n\nI was among those arrested outside of Hind's Hall, for linking arms with others in defense of those inside. More than 100 Columbia students were arrested by police in a quasi-military operation using flash bang explosives. One officer fired his gun in the Hall.\n\nI graduated from Columbia in 2016 and was a member of the Barnard/Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In my senior year, we and our friends in Jewish Voice for Peace launched a campaign to pressure Columbia to divest from companies which profit from Israel's military occupation of Palestinian land and apartheid system.\n\nWe founded Columbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD) as part of a non-violent international movement that seeks to place economic pressure on Israel to comply with international law. As Columbia students, we looked to our elders who protested our alma mater in 1968 for her complicity in the Vietnam War and in the 1980s to demand she divest from South African apartheid. We also followed the example of our classmates, who successfully pressured Columbia to divest from private prisons in 2015 and thermal coal in 2017.\n\nWhen we founded CUAD, we understood the urgency of our campaign; that every year of Israel's occupation was another year in which Palestinians faced the theft of their land and homes, in which millions were forced to live as refugees, and in which countless faced brutal repression from Israel's occupying army. We could not have imagined how much more urgent the demands of our campaign would become.\n\nWe're now in the seventh month of a ruthless Israeli military campaign that both the International Court of Justice and a U.S. federal court have determined may amount to genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. It has killed more than 34,000 people, mostly women and children, injured more than 76,000 others, and displaced 1.7 million more.\n\nIsrael has blocked most food and humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, leaving more than 1.1 million people to suffer catastrophic starvation with an estimated more than 50,000 children under five being acutely malnourished. Israel has systematically targeted doctors and hospitals, decimating the health care system.\n\nLast month, another mass grave with the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians was discovered at the Nasser Hospital compound. All universities in Gaza have been destroyed and most primary schools have been closed or serving as shelters.\n\nStudents across the United States understand that this is the most catastrophic humanitarian crisis of the century, that it was deliberately created by Israel, and that their universities have deep financial ties to the industries that are carrying it out. They are demanding an end to this complicity.\n\nFew of the core demands of CUAD's campaign have changed in nearly a decade of campus organizing. Students are demanding that Columbia disclose and divest its endowment from any companies complicit in the ongoing genocide of Palestinians and in Israeli apartheid.\n\nBy investing in these companies, Columbia is using the tuition students pay to fund the weapons, technology, and institutions that build illegal Israeli settlements on stolen Palestinian land, imprison Palestinians indefinitely, without charge, destroy their fresh water and agricultural infrastructure, and bomb them relentlessly and indiscriminately.\n\nStudents are also demanding that Columbia cut ties with Tel Aviv University and close its Global Center in Tel Aviv. In situating itself within Tel Aviv, Columbia not only shows its commitment to pouring billions into Israeli institutions, it also shows its complete disregard to its Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim students and those vocally critical of Israel who are regularly refused entry or deported by Israel on the basis of their race, faith, national origin, and political viewpoint.\n\nIf Columbia offers educational programming that any of its students is unable to access or must do so under conditions of apartheid, Columbia will be in violation of U.S. law.\n\nIn its interim ruling, the ICJ ordered Israel to prevent acts of genocide. As the world watches Israel flout the ICJ's orders with impunity, many are at a loss for what can be done to help end the horrific slaughter in Gaza and Israel's decades long oppression of the Palestinian people. Students and Palestinian human rights defenders have had the answer all along: Boycott, divestment, and sanctions until Israel complies with international law and respects Palestinian human rights.",

Experts say calls for divestment rarely, if ever, have a financial impact on the intended target. However, divestment calls likely help demonstrators raise awareness about the issue they're protesting -- and about how money flows between educational institutions and large businesses.\n\nIntel has been just one target of student protesters in Oregon who are calling for an end to the war in Gaza. The chipmaker is the state's largest private employer with more than 20,000 employees. It helps fund research and technology programs at many Oregon schools. The company's ties to Oregon and the U.S. government have only gotten tighter in recent months, with Intel receiving state and federal financial incentives, which are contributing to the company's plans to invest $36 billion in Oregon facilities in the coming years.\n\nAt the same time, Intel has significant ties to Israel. It has multiple facilities in Israel and has invested more than $50 billion in the country in the 50 years it's had operations there.\n\nIntel, which did not return a request for comment for this story, is just one company protesters have included in their divestment calls. It's become increasingly common for university endowments to be invested in multiple companies. Demonstrators against the war in Gaza have called on schools across the state to divest from a number of companies with ties to Israel, such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.\n\nThe tactic is not new. For decades college students have demanded divestment around issues that matter to them, according to Bruce Podobnik, associate professor of sociology at Lewis & Clark College.\n\n\"The Vietnam War is an example where college students and university students around the country really pressured their schools to divest and disconnect from the military industrial complex,\" Podobnik said. \"It didn't always work. It's very difficult sometimes for colleges and universities to make those changes -- but it did have an effect.\"\n\nPodobnik said there's a social movement cycle that protests tend to move through, and nowadays it often starts on social media with an issue going viral.\n\n\"College students all over the world will become concerned about issues, and then activism will emerge out of that,\" he said. \"And it might spread really rapidly, as we say, like wildfire.\"\n\nThat's often followed by demonstrations and increasing news coverage, Podobnik said, which attracts the attention of officials and other authorities. That can lead to an intensification, like the occupation at the PSU library and the police response. Then things taper off.\n\n\"Even though we can anticipate here in Portland and across the country that the student protests will diminish over time, they still leave a lasting impact after them,\" Podobnik said. \"I think it's important to recognize that cycle is inevitable -- and it's powerful.\"\n\nPowerful, he said, because it raises awareness. At the beginning of the cycle, the message may be targeted at university officials, companies and lawmakers. As the protest gains media attention, it may expand beyond that. Tactics like calling for divestment may cause individuals to think about what their own investments support, or it may prompt them to research more about where certain companies operate and spend money.\n\nBut Podobnik is clear that demanding divestment is a tool used as part of a larger strategy for a protest movement. He points to protests against apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s. Podobnik said divestment wasn't the reason apartheid ended in the country, but it added pressure to the situation and the movement helped raise awareness in the U.S.\n\nCliff Bekar, economic historian at Lewis & Clark College, said ultimately if a university did pull its investments, it's unlikely to hurt a company financially or force a change in foreign policy.\n\n\"It's fair to say the overwhelming consensus right now in the empirical literature is, if a divestment initiative is limited to universities or even a small set of universities,\" he said, \"the impact on the companies is zero.\"\n\nBekar said as the global economy becomes more interconnected, it's increasingly difficult to target a specific country or source with a divestment campaign. There also could be unintended consequences at a university after the divestment, like less money available for scholarships.\n\nAt Portland State University, school President Ann Cudd agreed to pause all ties to Boeing, citing concerns from the community regarding the company's weapons manufacturing divisions and ties to Israel. Cudd said the school had no investments in Boeing but did accept donations from the company.\n\nShe has not addressed calls to cut ties from other companies, like Intel. Leaders at other schools in the state have either said they will not divest from companies with connections to Israel, or they haven't specifically responded to the protest demand.", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divestment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divestment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_&_Clark_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis & Clark College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial endowment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military\u2013industrial_complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military\u2013industrial complex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sociology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unintended consequences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/4E2CFBZVLVFWBBJ6OQQSDTPVCA.jpg?auth=f14c9b850cba9af687bdfcb2152351bb60f7b9fdbd854c9c824ef407bbfcdaa6&width=1200&height=675&focal=682%2C1562", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540416", "eventUri": "eng-9540416", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Endowments are typically invested in various things, such as stocks or real estate, to grow the funds available at the university's disposal over time.\n\nThe largest university endowment in the United States belongs to Harvard University, which had a roughly $50.9 billion endowment for fiscal 2022, according to the U.S. News and World Report.\n\nAndrew Gillen, a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit Texas Public Policy Foundation, told the outlet that endowments are essentially a \"super-charged rainy-day fund,\" adding that typically, funds are managed by the school or by a group closely tied to the university.\n\nEndowments are in place at private universities, and because of this, they are not subject to the same transparency as public universities. Private schools, like Columbia, tend to keep financial information vague and publish only select financial reports annually.\n\nTypically, specific investments are not known by most, as the endowments are typically run by investment managers and the school's board of trustees. The investments are typically made with the goal of helping grow the endowment.\n\n\"Colleges and universities have fairly limited discretion in the actual specific investments that their endowment funds are going towards because they've hired these external experts to make those decisions. And sometimes those decisions are even proprietary,\" Todd Ely, associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, told the Associated Press last month.\n\nAnti-Israel protesters have latched on to the divestment goals of groups opposed to the Jewish state's treatment of Palestinians. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement is one of the largest groups opposed to Israel and works to pressure companies and groups to shun Israel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSeveral protesters have drawn parallels to student-led movements in the 1980s, which pushed universities to divest from apartheid South Africa.

For context, the entire gross domestic product of Jordan is about $49 billion.\n\nUniversity endowment investments are complex, often with holdings in funds that support any number of companies, including some tied to the aerospace and defence industry.\n\nOn many campuses, students say they do not know the extent of the campus ties with Israel.\n\nYale University is one of many campuses where students are demanding transparency about investments.\n\nThe university does not make all of its investments public, and money can be hard to track after it goes to outside investment managers hired by colleges.\n\nActivists in some places have identified specific ties that they want to end. Students at the University of Michigan said the school sends billions of dollars to investment managers that profit from the war.\n\nThey gave examples of investments in companies that produce drones and surveillance technology used in Israel.\n\nCampaigns to pressure universities to divest for political or ethical reasons go back decades, at least to the 1970s when students demanded that colleges withdraw from investments that benefited South Africa under apartheid rule.\n\nThis century, many universities barred investments in things such as alcohol, tobacco and gambling, according to a report from the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund.\n\nMany endowments now include some environmental, social and governance criteria in their portfolios, which expands the factors in considering the value of an investment beyond profits and losses.\n\nBut divesting is no simple matter. Cutting ties with Israeli or defence-linked funds will probably lead to charges of anti-Semitism from critics of the student protests.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Financial endowment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northwestern University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rutgers University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/College", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/College", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KRFJACZMMKDA4HHDKGJEHOSH2A.jpg?smart=true&auth=fd56ea581a3f09852224cdb2238acfda525ecd70114921eaf27802b96838a78f&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540416", "eventUri": "eng-9540416", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 489, "textEnd": 497}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

But how much have they actually invested?", "body": "Across the countries, student protesters are demanding their university endowments \"divest\" from Israel. Brown University, where I am on the faculty, agreed last week to let students representing the protesters present a proposal to the corporation that runs the university to divest from funds \"with companies associated with Israel's military,\" in exchange for them ending the encampment. But what does divestment actually mean?\n\nThe answer: Practically nothing. Depending on how the demand is articulated, divestment from Israel is either insignificant, as only about 1% of all firms in the American stock exchanges are Israeli, or so completely unrealistic and unreasonable -- severing ties with almost all American multinational companies -- as to be an ineffective tool to pressure the Israeli government.\n\nFor student protesters who may be disappointed to learn that, in fact, there will not be much, if at all to practically divest from, a better bet would be to demand from universities to invest in Gaza and the Palestinians more generally, an idea that we could all rally behind.\n\nThere are three buckets where the university endowments could be investing in Israeli and Israeli-related positions: directly in Israeli firms through the stock market and through alternative investments, and indirectly through investing in non-Israeli firms that do business with Israel.\n\nOut of approximately 9,000 securities listed on U.S. stock exchanges, only about 120 are Israeli -- as in, based out of Israel. That means actual exposure of university endowments to these companies is likely minimal, given the breadth and diversity typical in well-managed investment portfolios. Thus, the likelihood that Israeli companies constitute a significant portion of these portfolios for any university is quite low, if not zero. Even if universities were to sell their stock positions of these companies that, perhaps, could result in a lower value of the stock, other investors could easily buy the stock back up in the marketplace, bringing up the value again.\n\nSome student protesters might be making a much more extensive demand: That universities must drop so-called alternative investments in private equity or venture capital funds that invest in privately owned Israeli companies. I'm afraid they will not find much there either.\n\nWhile universities' endowments are known to hold considerable investments in private equity and the similar products, they do this through funds that diversify across a large number of companies in a large number of markets. With Israel being such a small country and receiving private equity funds reaching $10 billion out of a global market of $1 trillion, the share of university endowments invested into Israeli firms through these funds is likely negligible.\n\nEven if some universities explicitly rebalance their portfolio to eliminate the already tiny amount of investment in Israel-specific funds, this will likely not represent a long-term challenge to Israel, which remains among the top countries globally in terms of venture funding per capita. That means that investors are generally quite open to betting on Israeli enterprises, and have consistently found high enough returns to continue doing so, regardless of political considerations.\n\nIf the call for divestment extends to severing ties with any global firm that has any business relationship with Israeli entities -- a type of \"all-or-nothing\" approach that has been a banner of the BDS movement -- that would imply divesting from tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, among many other global giants like Boeing that have close ties with Israel.\n\nThese companies not only do business in Israel, but also have subsidiaries and employees on the ground. Israel hosts around 300 foreign research and development centers owned by the world's largest multinational companies, which have located outposts there to benefit from Israel's unique innovation ecosystem.\n\nTo ask universities to end connections with these companies is simply unrealistic. It would necessitate a radical overhaul of investment strategies -- one that might not even be possible, as there are few reasonable portfolios that would not include many of these firms. It would also be hypocritical for protesters to demand such a thing without making any demands from anyone who holds, say, a basic retirement account -- including their family members -- which are very likely exposed to firms that fall into this category, and have tremendously benefited from their success.\n\nInstead, I wish there would be more demands from the protesters for university endowments and other actors to spend money in Gaza, rather than to divest from Israel. Gaza is in need for an unprecedented rebuilding effort, after the massive destruction resulting from the war. Recent estimates by the World Bank and the United Nations put the investment required to rebuild Gaza at $18.5 billion dollars.\n\nThis includes a significant investment in housing which accounts for 72% of the cost, and public infrastructure such as water, health and education accounting for 19%. University endowments could support these efforts to rebuild by also investing in the local economy in a variety of ways: through public-private partnerships focused on infrastructure rebuilding, or even in funds that invest in local private firms that are always in the need for credit to expand, and could provide employment and good wages to hundreds of thousands of Gazans, as well as Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.\n\nBeyond hard core investments, Gazans can tremendously benefit from things universities in particular could easily fund: more exchanges by providing scholarships for students -- including giving the same American students who sympathize with the protests the chance to go there in person and volunteer on the ground -- and fellowships for allowing faculty to visit for extended periods of time.\n\nThese are all the important investments that are badly needed, alongside the required political compromises on both sides, to start building a future -- even if not very tangible right now -- of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace, security and economic prosperity for all.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType":

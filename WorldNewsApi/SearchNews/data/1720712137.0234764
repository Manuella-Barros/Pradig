{"id": 231955232, "title": "No regrets \u2013 Michael O\u2019Neill sees long-term value in Northern Ireland's defeat to Spain", "text": "Northern Ireland came into the friendly in Palma on the back of an encouraging run of two wins and a draw against Denmark, Romania and Scotland, and were in dreamland when Daniel Ballard headed them in front inside 70 seconds. But Spain, ranked eighth in the world, are a cut above. Pedri scored twice with Alvaro Morata and Fabian Ruiz also finding the net to make it 4-1 at half-time, and substitute Mikel Oyarzabal added a fifth in the second half. It was a stark reminder of the sort of class Northern Ireland could come up against in the World Cup qualifiers next year \u2013 precisely the reason O\u2019Neill agreed to the fixture. \u201cI felt it was the right opportunity,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt would have been easier possibly to play a nation more at our level but in the Nations League we\u2019re going to play teams at our level, this was an opportunity to show our players the highest level. \u201cWe have to take that in mind with the World Cup (qualifiers) starting in March, we need to play against as many good teams as possible so I\u2019ve no regrets about taking the game. \u201cWe will deal with the result. I\u2019ve been beaten before.\u201d While Spain are into their final preparations for the Euros, listed amongst the favourites, many Northern Ireland players had not played competitively in a month and the gulf in experience was also clear. \u201cWe\u2019re a very young side and you could see from the substitutions we got younger as the game went on,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cFor a lot of our players, they don\u2019t play club football at that level so they get exposure in a game like this. The positive is it shows our players this is the level they have to get to to play top international football.\u201d O\u2019Neill switched to a back four at half-time and it helped to stem the tide, but he said he did not want to make major changes to the system that has been working for his team in recent times. \u201cWe\u2019ve defended deep against Denmark, against Scotland and against Romania and we\u2019ve defended well, we only conceded one goal (across the three games), but we faced a higher level of player here and that\u2019s something we have to bear in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the second half with the back four we defended better than we did with the back three or back five but we have to trust it, we can\u2019t just rip it up and do something else. We have to believe in this system going forwards.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s game against Andorra in Murcia offers Northern Ireland a quick opportunity to flip the narrative and record another win. \u201cThe dressing room is quiet but I don\u2019t think it will damage morale,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t come here with the expectation of winning the game, we came with the expectation to make it difficult and see if we could possibly hurt Spain. \u201cUltimately we saw we still have a lot of development as a team to get to that point.\u201d", "summary": "Michael O\u2019Neill insisted he had no regrets about pitting his young Northern Ireland players against Spain as they will benefit in the long term from Saturday\u2019s 5-1 defeat.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/football/northern-ireland/no-regrets-michael-oneill-sees-long-term-value-in-northern-irelands-defeat-to-spain-4658686", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmFkZjVjNzIzLWVhM2YtNDQxMy1hYTViLTA1NzM3YTVjNjkyYTozNTAxN2YwOC1hZWZiLTQyNWYtYmJkYi0zYTJlZWM0NTI0NDg=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:28:43", "author": "Ian Parker", "authors": ["Ian Parker"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.131}

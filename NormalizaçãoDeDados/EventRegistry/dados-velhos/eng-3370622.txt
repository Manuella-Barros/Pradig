And on Thursday, he joined the protest in his own way by supporting Jenkins.\n\n\"I was inspired by a lot of the allies that were there to stand up against hate in my hometown, and I wasn't able to be there to protest or to stand up against hate,\" Long said after the Eagles beat the Bills, 20-16. \"People like Heather Heyer gave their life for that, and I was inspired by that. I just told Malcolm, 'I'm here for you.' I think it's a good time for people that look like me to be there for people that are fighting for equality.\"\n\nEagles' Chris Long joins Malcolm Jenkins in national anthem protest before preseason game\n\nEarlier this week, Seattle Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett told ESPN that more white players need to be involved in the protests to help alter the conversation surrounding them. Long appears to be the first white player to take part in a national anthem protest in any fashion.\n\n\"I've heard a lot of people say, 'Why do athletes get involved in the national anthem protests?' I've said before that I'll never for an anthem because the flag means something different for everybody in this country, but I support my peers,\" Long said. \"If you don't see why you need allies for people that are fighting for equality right now, I don't think you'll ever see it. My things is, Malcolm is a leader, and I'm here to show support as a white athlete.\"\n\nEagles cornerback Ron Brooks, who was out with an injury, also kneeled during the pregame ceremony.

I don't think the President has done a good enough job of striking that down. I share that sentiment with a lot of people.\n\n\"With or without the President's reaction, this is something as Americans ... The reason I stand for the anthem is because I'm standing for Americans and what we can be. If you looked at my hometown this weekend, as much hatred as there was, there were a lot of people of every color and creed who stood up against hate. That's kind of why I'm inspired to stand for the anthem. I hope that one day, everyone can look at that anthem and think 'that's my anthem.'\"\n\nMore than just a post-game soundbite, Long put his words into action by joining teammate Malcolm Jenkins in his silent protest of the Star Spangled Banner prior to Thursday's game, as the University of Virginia product rested his arm across Jenkins' shoulder as Jenkins once again raised his fist in the air in an act of defiance against the mistreatment of minorities in this nation.\n\nEagles' Ron Brooks kneels for Anthem\n\n\"It was a hard week for everybody,\" Long said of his decision to join Jenkins in his weekly anthem protest. \"It's a hard week for somebody coming from Charlottesville. It's a tough week for America. Really, I've heard a lot of people say that we needed white athletes to get involved with the anthem protest ... I've said before that I'll never kneel for the anthem, because the anthem and flag mean something different for everybody in this country, but I support my peers.\n\n\"If you don't see why you need allies for people that are fighting for equality right now, I don't think you'll ever see it. My thing is, Malcolm is a leader. I'm here to show support as a white athlete.\"\n\nLong explained that he spoke with Jenkins prior to joining him, in his 17th protest of the anthem.\n\n\"I think it's very important,\" Jenkins said of Long following in his efforts to fight injustice and for equality. \"Especially at this point in time. I asked Chris what message he wants to get across, and his biggest thing was that in this point in time, white men need to step up and be allies in this fight.\n\n\"He understands that although our struggles are different, our perspectives and experiences are different, this is a moment in time in which we need to take that step out and lead. I appreciate that.\"\n\nJenkins went on to praise Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie for his support of the players using their platform to aim for social reform.\n\n\"I'm grateful for that opportunity to have an owner that's verbally expressed to me that he's in support of my efforts,\" Jenkins said of Lurie. \"And he's encouraging us.

He said earlier in the week that the protesters don't represent the values of his hometown and called their actions \"despicable.\"\n\n\"I haven't seen statistics, but I'd be willing to bet the vast majority of people voicing those white supremacist sentiments were from out of town,\" he said. \"The majority of the people that were defending our hometown against ideals like that were from Charlottesville, or students. It's disheartening, but I really think it's desperation for those folks to feel threatened by us doing the right thing.\"\n\nA source close to Jenkins told ESPN last week that he intended to demonstrate for the entire season.\n\n\"The protest itself is not the end all, be all,\" Jenkins said at his locker stall Tuesday. \"It's not something I'm looking at to actually make a big change, and so that's kind of why I went back and forth if I wanted to do it this year. But the one thing I didn't want to do is stop publicly expressing my thoughts, and suddenly the conversation dies out and you lose that momentum. I think it's important to continue to do the work behind the scenes but also continue to use the platform that I have to speak up and open our eyes about it.\"\n\nJenkins raised a fist above his head during the anthem for all but one game in 2016; the exception was the regular-season opener against the Cleveland Brownson on Sept. 11, out of respect for those who served and died on that day in 2001. Jenkins raised his fist during the anthem again last week before the preseason opener against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe pregame demonstrations were kick-started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who began sitting during the national anthem in the 2016 preseason before taking a knee for the final preseason contest and 16 regular-season games.\n\nSources told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter in March that Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem this upcoming season. He has not been signed by another team since opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers months ago, however.\n\n\"What happened to Charlottesville, to me, was not a starting point. ... If you hadn't seen a problem until the other day, then you've kind of been sleeping.\"\n\nJenkins is one of several players who have continued the protest in Kaepernick's absence. Others across the league have voiced their support for the cause and concern over whether Kaepernick is being blackballed as a result of his actions.\n\n\"Last year, the people who were against Kaepernick were probably making the most noise, and now you have the reverse,\" Jenkins said. \"So keeping him out of the league, you think that things are going to smooth over, but in actuality you're having a bigger uproar from people who want to see him have a job, especially if him not having a job is solely on his political stance.\"\n\nSeattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat during the national anthem last Sunday before their preseason opener against the Los Angeles Rams, in part because of the recent events in Charlottesville, Virginia. Bennett's teammate, receiver Doug Baldwin, said he is considering joining Bennett in the demonstration. Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem before the team's 20-10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday.\n\nJenkins said he does not expect to see a large uptick in anthem protests as a result of what transpired in Charlottesville.\n\n\"What happened to Charlottesville, to me, was not a starting point,\" he said. \"To me, that would not be the point in which somebody would start to do the protest. That was a result of years and years of frustrations and battles that have been going on for a long time. Those are just kind of the results of the existence of hate, racism and prejudices that have long plagued America. So I don't see people now trying to get involved in that, because if you hadn't seen a problem until the other day, then you've kind of been sleeping.\"\n\nJenkins has developed into one of the leaders of the NFL players' off-the-field movement. He helps coordinate the efforts of a growing network of NFL players looking to get involved in social activism, has made multiple trips to Capitol Hill to speak with politicians about mass incarceration and police brutality, and has met local law enforcement and participated in a ride-along with Philadelphia police.\n\nWhile he wants to off-field efforts to be the primary focus, he feels the protests are still needed to bring attention to the issues of social injustice.\n\n\"As the blowback against those who stand up for what is right thickens, I feel it is necessary to push forward with a relentless determination,\" he told ESPN in a statement last week. \"I want to send a message that we will not easily be moved or deterred from fighting for justice.\"", "date":

And this isn't political. That's the thing, everyone wants to turn this political. This isn't a political issue. This is right and wrong. And I believe you're on one side or the other.

Earlier this month, ESPN reported Jenkins planned to continue his protest.\n\nJenkins followed the lead of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, whose national anthem protest of sitting and then kneeling became a national topic of conversation. That buzz continued into this offseason as Kaepernick remained unsigned despite the need for quarterbacks across the league.\n\n\"This is just some other teams being, quite honestly, cowards, to say that they're afraid of backlash to sign someone to make their team better when fans' input has never been in the equation when it comes to signing people in the past,\" Jenkins said. \"It's certain owners' way of making an example out of [Kaepernick] to discourage anybody else from doing what he did.\"\n\nIn an appearance on ESPN's SC6, Bennett said that more support from white teammates could help black players in their protests. He sat during the anthem before Seattle's first preseason game Sunday.\n\n\"It would take a white player to really get things changed,\" Bennett said Wednesday on ESPN's SC6, \"because when somebody from the other side understands and they step up and they speak up about it ... it would change the whole conversation. Because when you bring somebody who doesn't have to be a part of [the] conversation making himself vulnerable in front of it, I think when that happens, things will really take a jump.\"", "date":

Teammate Chris Long joined Jenkins on Thursday night, placing a hand on Jenkins' shoulder. It was a small gesture in the moment, but it could have significant impact on the ongoing anthem debate.\n\nWhy? Very simple. Jenkins, like Colin Kaepernick and most -- if not all -- the anthem protesters in the NFL to date, is black. Long is white.\n\n\"I think it's a good time for people that look like me to be here for people that are fighting for equality,\" Long said after the game. A graduate of the University of Virginia who considers Charlottesville his home, Long spoke out in no uncertain terms about President Trump's \"both sides\" equivocation in the wake of last weekend's fatal riots.\n\n\"It's been a hard week for everybody,\" he continued. \"I think it's not just a hard week for someone being from Charlottesville. It's a tough week for America. I've heard a lot of people say, 'You need white athletes to get involved in the anthem protest.' I've said before that I'll never kneel for an anthem because the flag means something different to everybody in this country, but I support my peers.\"\n\nLong then directly addressed the critics he knew would be rising out of the comment sections and sports-radio call-ins of the world: \"If you don't see why you need allies for people that are fighting for equality right now, I don't think you'll ever see it,\" he said. \"My thing is, Malcolm's a leader and I'm here to show support as a white athlete.\"\n\nJenkins is one of a growing number of athletes taking a strong stand against racial injustice, using the nonviolent symbolism of silent anthem protest to draw attention to their cause. Kaepernick, of course, is out of a job at the moment; whether that's because of his political protest or his lack of skills is a matter of some dispute. But Jenkins, a highly regarded safety, ranked 90th on the NFL's Top 100 list earlier this year. Like fellow protester Michael Bennett of Seattle and (possibly) Marshawn Lynch of Oakland, he's not so easy to brush aside from a football perspective.\n\n\"Stepping out in front of all those people and the obvious attention that is going to be brought to it is not an easy thing to do,\" Jenkins said after the game. \"I think looking at the atmosphere last year compared to this year, so much has transpired, and in a negative direction, that I think the stakes are almost higher now.\"\n\n\"When you get in the position on a platform where you get a chance to give back and create opportunities for others, that's where I want my legacy to be,\" Bennett told Yahoo Sports earlier this week. \"I want to create opportunities for others. I want to raise the bar about what we can do as athletes and people.\"\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports and the author of EARNHARDT NATION, on sale now at Amazon or wherever books are sold.

In an apparent show of support, defensive end Chris Long kept his hand on Jenkins' back for the entire playing of the \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" Then Long gave Jenkins a pat on the shoulder pads and a hug when the song was over. -- Tim McManus", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 100, "id": 566, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "wgt": 100, "id": 567, "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100, "id": 728, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "wgt": 100, "id": 829, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305872", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310476", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310749", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312097", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "314202", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "327126", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331327", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336230", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Jenkins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "358830", "label": {"eng": "Malcolm Jenkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Long", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "366920", "label": {"eng": "Chris Long"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "395519", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}}]}

(Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)\n\n\"First Take\" co-host Max Kellerman added his voice to the debate about social-justice activism in the NFL on Thursday, calling it a \"disgrace\" and \"embarrassing\" that no white NFL players had supported their black teammates in their national anthem protests. To drive home his point, he used the example of Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese in 1947, when Robinson broke Major League Baseball's color barrier.\n\n\"And Pee Wee Reese, as they're booing Jackie Robinson and all this, walks over to Jackie Robinson and puts his arm around him saying: 'See this guy? He's with me and I'm with him, and anything you're saying about him you're saying to me, too,' \" Kellerman said. \"There's not one Pee Wee Reese in the NFL?\"\n\nThere's at least one: On Thursday night, Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Chris Long kept his hand on teammate Malcolm Jenkins's back as Jenkins raised his fist during the national anthem ahead of their preseason game against the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\"I've heard a lot of people say you need white athletes to get involved in the anthem protests,\" Long said afterward, per ESPN. \"I've said before I'll never kneel for an anthem, because the flag means something different for everybody in this country, but I support my peers. And if you don't see why you need allies for people that are fighting for equality right now, I don't think you'll ever see it. So my thing is, Malcolm is a leader, and I'm here to show support as a white athlete.\"\n\nLong said he drew inspiration from those who stood up to the white supremacists who last weekend marched on Charlottesville, his home town. Especially Heather Heyer, who was killed Saturday when an alleged white nationalist plowed his car into a crowd.\n\n\"I was inspired by a lot of the allies that were there to stand up against hate in my home town, and I wasn't able to be there to protest or to stand up against hate. People like Heather Heyer gave their lives for that, and I was inspired by that,\" he said. \"So it's just telling Malcolm, I am here for you, and I think it's a good time for people who look like me to be here for people fighting for equality.\"\n\nJenkins, who started raising his fist during the anthem last season and reportedly will continue doing so in 2017, said Long talked with him about his

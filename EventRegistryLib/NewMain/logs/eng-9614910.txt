It was detected in U.S. dairy herds in March, although investigators think it may have been in cows since December. This week, the USDA announced it had been found in alpacas for the first time.\n\nAt least three people - all workers at farms with infected cows - have been diagnosed with bird flu, although the illnesses were considered mild.\n\nFILE - Cows stand in the milking parlor of a dairy farm in New Vienna, Iowa, on Monday, July 24, 2023. The bird flu outbreak in U.S. dairy cows is prompting development of new, next-generation mRNA vaccines - akin to COVID-19 shots - that are being tested in both animals and people. In June 2024, the U.S. Agriculture Department is to begin testing a vaccine developed by University of Pennsylvania researchers by giving it to calves.

Officials are taking steps to be prepared if the virus mutates in a way to make it more deadly or enables it to spread more easily from person to person.\n\nTraditionally, most flu vaccines are made via an egg-based manufacturing process that's been used for more than 70 years. It involves injecting a candidate virus into fertilized chicken eggs, which are incubated for several days to allow the viruses to grow. Fluid is harvested from the eggs and is used as the basis for vaccines, with killed or weakened virus priming the body's immune system.\n\nRather than eggs - also vulnerable to bird flu-caused supply constraints - some flu vaccine is made in giant vats of cells.\n\nOfficials say they already have two candidate vaccines for people that appear to be well-matched to the bird flu virus in U.S. dairy herds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used the circulating bird flu virus as the seed strain for them.\n\nThe government has hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses in pre-filled syringes and vials that likely could go out in a matter of weeks, if needed, federal health officials say.\n\nThey also say they have bulk antigen that could generate nearly 10 million more doses that could be filled, finished and distributed in a matter of a few months. CSL Seqirus, which manufactures cell-based flu vaccine, this week announced that the government hired it to fill and finish about 4.8 million of those doses. The work could be done by late summer, U.S. health officials said this week.\n\nBut the production lines for flu vaccines are already working on this fall's seasonal shots - work that would have to be interrupted to produce millions more doses of bird flu vaccine. So the government has been pursuing another, quicker approach: the mRNA technology used to produce the primary vaccines deployed against COVID-19.\n\nThese messenger RNA vaccines are made using a small section of genetic material from the virus. The genetic blueprint is designed to teach the body how to make a protein used to build immunity.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Moderna already has a bird flu mRNA vaccine in very early-stage human testing. In a statement, Moderna confirmed that \"we are in discussions with the U.S. government on advancing our pandemic flu candidate.\"\n\nSimilar work has been going on at Pfizer. Company researchers in December gave human volunteers an mRNA vaccine against a bird flu strain that's similar to - but not exactly the same as - the one in cows. Since then, researchers have performed a lab experiment exposing blood samples from those volunteers to the strain seen in dairy farms, and saw a \"notable increases in antibody responses,\" Pfizer said in a statement.\n\nAs for the vaccine for cows, Penn immunologist Scott Hensley worked with mRNA pioneer and Nobel laureate Drew Weissman to produce the experimental doses. Hensley said that vaccine is similar to the Moderna one for people.\n\nIn first-step testing, mice and ferrets produced high levels of bird flu virus-fighting antibodies after vaccination.\n\nIn another experiment, researchers vaccinated one group of ferrets and deliberately infected them, and then compared what happened to ferrets that hadn't been vaccinated. All the vaccinated animals survived and the unvaccinated did not, Hensley said.\n\n\"The vaccine was really successful,\" said Webby, whose lab did that work last year in collaboration with Hensley.\n\nThe cow study will be akin to the first-step testing initially done in smaller animals. The plan is for initially about 10 calves to be vaccinated, half with one dose and half with another. Then their blood will be drawn and examined to look for how much bird flu-fighting antibodies were produced.\n\nThe USDA study first will have to determine the right dose for such a large animal, Hensley said, before testing if it protects them like it did smaller animals.\n\nWhat \"scares me the most is the amount of interaction between cattle and humans,\" Hensley said.\n\n\"We\u00b4re not talking about an animal that lives on a mountain top,\" he said. \"If this was a bobcat outbreak I\u00b4d feel bad for the bobcats, but that\u00b4s not a big human risk.\"\n\nIf a vaccine reduces the amount of virus in the cow, \"then ultimately we reduce the chance that a mutant virus that spreads in humans is going to emerge,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u00b4s Science and Educational Media Group.

The idea: If vaccinating cows protects dairy workers, that could mean fewer chances for the virus to jump into people and mutate in ways that could spur human-to-human spread.\n\nMeanwhile. the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has been talking to manufacturers about possible mRNA flu vaccines for people that, if needed, could supplement millions of bird flu vaccine doses already in government hands.\n\n\"If there's a pandemic, there's going to be a huge demand for vaccine,\" said Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. \"The more different (vaccine manufacturing) platforms that can respond to that, the better.\"\n\nThe bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal species in scores of countries since 2020. It was detected in U.S. dairy herds in March, although investigators think it may have been in cows since December. This week, the USDA announced it had been found in alpacas for the first time.\n\nAt least three people -- all workers at farms with infected cows -- have been diagnosed with bird flu, although the illnesses were considered mild.\n\nBut earlier versions of the same H5N1 flu virus have been highly lethal to humans in other parts of the world. Officials are taking steps to be prepared if the virus mutates in a way to make it more deadly or enables it to spread more easily from person to person.\n\nTraditionally, most flu vaccines are made via an egg-based manufacturing process that's been used for more than 70 years. It involves injecting a candidate virus into fertilized chicken eggs, which are incubated for several days to allow the viruses to grow. Fluid is harvested from the eggs and is used as the basis for vaccines, with killed or weakened virus priming the body's immune system.\n\nRather than eggs -- also vulnerable to bird flu-caused supply constraints -- some flu vaccine is made in giant vats of cells.\n\nOfficials say they already have two candidate vaccines for people that appear to be well-matched to the bird flu virus in U.S. dairy herds. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used the circulating bird flu virus as the seed strain for them.\n\nThe government has hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses in pre-filled syringes and vials that likely could go out in a matter of weeks, if needed, federal health officials say.\n\nThey also say they have bulk antigen that could generate nearly 10 million more doses that could be filled, finished and distributed in a matter of a few months. CSL Seqirus, which manufactures cell-based flu vaccine, this week announced that the government hired it to fill and finish about 4.8 million of those doses. The work could be done by late summer, U.S. health officials said this week.\n\nBut the production lines for flu vaccines are already working on this fall's seasonal shots -- work that would have to be interrupted to produce millions more doses of bird flu vaccine. So the government has been pursuing another, quicker approach: the mRNA technology used to produce the primary vaccines deployed against COVID-19.\n\nThese messenger RNA vaccines are made using a small section of genetic material from the virus. The genetic blueprint is designed to teach the body how to make a protein used to build immunity.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company Moderna already has a bird flu mRNA vaccine in very early-stage human testing. In a statement, Moderna confirmed that \"we are in discussions with the U.S. government on advancing our pandemic flu candidate.\"\n\nSimilar work has been going on at Pfizer. Company researchers in December gave human volunteers an mRNA vaccine against a bird flu strain that's similar to -- but not exactly the same as -- the one in cows. Since then, researchers have performed a lab experiment exposing blood samples from those volunteers to the strain seen in dairy farms, and saw a \"notable increases in antibody responses,\" Pfizer said in a statement.\n\nAs for the vaccine for cows, Penn immunologist Scott Hensley worked with mRNA pioneer and Nobel laureate Drew Weissman to produce the experimental doses. Hensley said that vaccine is similar to the Moderna one for people.\n\nIn first-step testing, mice and ferrets produced high levels of bird flu virus-fighting antibodies after vaccination.\n\nIn another experiment, researchers vaccinated one group of ferrets and deliberately infected them, and then compared what happened to ferrets that hadn't been vaccinated. All the vaccinated animals survived and the unvaccinated did not, Hensley said.\n\n\"The vaccine was really successful,\" said Webby, whose lab did that work last year in collaboration with Hensley.\n\nThe cow study will be akin to the first-step testing initially done in smaller animals. The plan is for initially about 10 calves to be vaccinated, half with one dose and half with another. Then their blood will be drawn and examined to look for how much bird flu-fighting antibodies were produced.\n\nThe USDA study first will have to determine the right dose for such a large animal, Hensley said, before testing if it protects them like it did smaller animals.\n\nWhat \"scares me the most is the amount of interaction between cattle and humans,\" Hensley said.\n\n\"We're not talking about an animal that lives on a mountain top,\" he said. \"If this was a bobcat outbreak I'd feel bad for the bobcats, but that's not a big human risk.\"\n\nIf a vaccine reduces the amount of virus in the cow, \"then ultimately we reduce the chance that a mutant virus that spreads in humans is going to emerge,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

All the vaccinated animals survived and the unvaccinated did not, Hensley said.\n\n\"The vaccine was really successful,\" said Webby, whose lab did that work last year in collaboration with Hensley.\n\nThe cow study will be akin to the first-step testing initially done in smaller animals. The plan is for initially about 10 calves to be vaccinated, half with one dose and half with another. Then their blood will be drawn and examined to look for how much bird flu-fighting antibodies were produced.\n\nThe USDA study first will have to determine the right dose for such a large animal, Hensley said, before testing if it protects them like it did smaller animals.\n\nWhat \"scares me the most is the amount of interaction between cattle and humans,\" Hensley said.\n\n\"We're not talking about an animal that lives on a mountain top,\" he said. \"If this was a bobcat outbreak I'd feel bad for the bobcats, but that's not a big human risk.\"\n\nIf a vaccine reduces the amount of virus in the cow, \"then ultimately we reduce the chance that a mutant virus that spreads in humans is going to emerge,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Right now, many egg-based production lines are focused on producing vaccines for seasonal flu. They could switch over to bird flu, but \"we don't have the capacity to do both,\" Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told KFF Health News. The US government is so worried about its egg supply that it keeps secret, heavily guarded flocks of chickens peppered throughout the country.\n\nMost of the flu virus used in vaccines is grown in eggs, but there are alternatives. The seasonal flu vaccine Flucelvax, produced by CSL Seqirus, is grown in a cell line derived in the 1950s from the kidney of a cocker spaniel. The virus used in the seasonal flu vaccine FluBlok, made by Protein Sciences, isn't grown; it's synthesized. Scientists engineer an insect virus to carry the gene for hemagglutinin, a key component of the flu virus that triggers the human immune system to create antibodies against it. That engineered virus turns insect cells into tiny hemagglutinin production plants.\n\nAnd then we have mRNA vaccines, which wouldn't require vaccine manufacturers to grow any virus at all. There aren't yet any approved mRNA vaccines for influenza, but many companies are fervently working on them, including Pfizer, Moderna, Sanofi, and GSK. \"With the covid vaccines and the infrastructure that's been built for covid, we now have the capacity to ramp up production of mRNA vaccines very quickly,\" says Hensley. This week, the Financial Times reported that the US government will soon close a deal with Moderna to provide tens of millions of dollars to fund a large clinical trial of a bird flu vaccine the company is developing.\n\nThere are hints that egg-free vaccines might work better than egg-based vaccines. A CDC study published in January showed that people who received Flucelvax or FluBlok had more robust antibody responses than those who received egg-based flu vaccines. That may be because viruses grown in eggs sometimes acquire mutations that help them grow better in eggs. Those mutations can change the virus so much that the immune response generated by the vaccine doesn't work as well against the actual flu virus that's circulating in the population.\n\nHensley and his colleagues are developing an mRNA vaccine against bird flu. So far they've only tested it in animals, but the shot performed well, he claims. \"All of our preclinical studies in animals show that these vaccines elicit a much stronger antibody response compared with conventional flu vaccines.\"\n\nNo one can predict when we might need a pandemic flu vaccine. But just because bird flu hasn't made the jump to a pandemic doesn't mean it won't. \"The cattle situation makes me worried,\" Hensley says. Humans are in constant contact with cows, he explains. While there have only been a couple of human cases so far, \"the fear is that some of those exposures will spark a fire.\" Let's make sure we can extinguish it quickly.\n\nIn a previous issue of The Checkup, Jessica Hamzelou explained what it would take for bird flu to jump to humans. And last month, after bird flu began circulating in cows, I posted an update that looked at strategies to protect people and animals.\n\nI don't have to tell you that mRNA vaccines are a big deal. In 2021, MIT Technology Review highlighted them as one of the year's 10 breakthrough technologies. Antonio Regalado explored their massive potential to transform medicine. Jessica Hamzelou wrote about the other diseases researchers are hoping to tackle. I followed up with a story after two mRNA researchers won a Nobel Prize. And earlier this year I wrote about a new kind of mRNA vaccine that's self-amplifying, meaning it not only works at lower doses, but also sticks around for longer in the body.\n\nResearchers installed a literal window into the brain, allowing for ultrasound imaging that they hope will be a step toward less invasive brain-computer interfaces.

That's because millions of fertilized hen eggs are still the main ingredient in making vaccines that, hopefully, will protect people against the outbreak of a new flu strain.\n\n\"It's almost comical to be using a 1940s technology for a 21st-century pandemic,\" said Rick Bright, who led the Health and Human Services Department's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) during the Trump administration.\n\nIt's not so funny, he said, when the currently stockpiled formulation against the H5N1 bird flu virus requires two shots and a whopping 90 micrograms of antigen, yet provides just middling immunity. \"For the U.S. alone, it would take hens laying 900,000 eggs every single day for nine months,\" Bright said.\n\nAnd that's only if the chickens don't get infected.\n\nThe spread of an avian flu virus has decimated flocks of birds (and killed barn cats and other mammals). Cattle in at least nine states and at least three people in the U.S. have been infected, enough to bring public health attention once again to the potential for a global pandemic.\n\nAs of May 30, the only confirmed human cases of infection were dairy workers in Texas and Michigan, who experienced eye irritation. Two quickly recovered, while the third developed respiratory symptoms and was being treated with an antiviral drug at home. The virus's spread into multiple species over a vast geographic area, however, raises the threat that further mutations could create a virus that spreads from human to human through airborne transmission.\n\nIf they do, prevention starts with the egg.\n\nTo make raw material for an influenza vaccine, virus is grown in millions of fertilized eggs. Sometimes it doesn't grow well, or it mutates to a degree that the vaccine product stimulates antibodies that don't neutralize the virus -- or the wild virus mutates to an extent that the vaccine doesn't work against it. And there's always the frightening prospect that wild birds could carry the virus into the henhouses needed in vaccine production.\n\n\"Once those roosters and hens go down, you have no vaccine,\" Bright said.\n\nSince 2009, when an H1N1 swine flu pandemic swept around the world before vaccine production could get off the ground, researchers and governments have been looking for alternatives. Billions of dollars have been invested into vaccines produced in mammalian and insect cell lines that don't pose the same risks as egg-based shots.\n\n\"Everyone knows the cell-based vaccines are better, more immunogenic, and offer better production,\" said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security. \"But they are handicapped because of the clout of egg-based manufacturing.\"\n\nThe companies that make the cell-based influenza vaccines, CSL Seqirus and Sanofi, also have billions invested in egg-based production lines that they aren't eager to replace. And it's hard to blame them, said Nicole Lurie, HHS' assistant secretary for preparedness and response under President Barack Obama who is now an executive director of CEPI, the global epidemic-fighting nonprofit.\n\n\"Most vaccine companies that responded to an epidemic -- Ebola, Zika, covid -- ended up losing a lot of money on it,\" Lurie said.\n\nExceptions were the mRNA vaccines created for covid, although even Pfizer and Moderna have had to destroy hundreds of millions of doses of unwanted vaccine as public interest waned.\n\nPfizer and Moderna are testing seasonal influenza vaccines made with mRNA, and the government is soliciting bids for mRNA pandemic flu vaccines, said David Boucher, director of infectious disease preparedness at HHS' Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.\n\nBright, whose agency invested a billion dollars in a cell-based flu vaccine factory in Holly Springs, North Carolina, said there's \"no way in hell we can fight an H5N1 pandemic with an egg-based vaccine.\" But for now, there's little choice.\n\nBARDA has stockpiled hundreds of thousands of doses of an H5N1-strain vaccine that stimulates the creation of antibodies that appear to neutralize the virus now circulating. It could produce millions more doses of the vaccine within weeks and up to 100 million doses in five months, Boucher told KFF Health News.\n\nBut the vaccines currently in the national stockpile are not a perfect match for the strain in question. Even with two shots containing six times as much vaccine substance as typical flu shots, the stockpiled vaccines were only partly effective against strains of the virus that circulated when those vaccines were made, Adalja said.\n\nHowever, BARDA is currently supporting two clinical trials with a candidate vaccine virus that \"is a good match for what we've found in cows,\" Boucher said.\n\nFlu vaccine makers are just starting to prepare this fall's shots but, eventually, the federal government could request production be switched to a pandemic-targeted strain.\n\n\"We don't have the capacity to do both,\" Adalja said.\n\nFor now, ASPR has a stockpile of bulk pandemic vaccine and has identified manufacturing sites where 4.8 million doses could be bottled and finished without stopping production of seasonal flu vaccine, ASPR chief Dawn O'Connell said on May 22. U.S. officials began trying to diversify away from egg-based vaccines in 2005, when avian flu first gripped the world, and with added vigor after the 2009 fiasco. But \"with the resources we have available, we get the best bang for our buck and best value to U.S. taxpayers when we leverage the seasonal infrastructure, and that's still mostly egg-based,\" Boucher said.\n\nFlu vaccine companies \"have a system that works well right now to accomplish their objectives in manufacturing the seasonal vaccine,\" he said. And without a financial incentive, \"we are going to be here with eggs for a while, I think.\"\n\nThis article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about

Following this process the report will be finalised and issued as advice to the Minister for Health.\n\nEach year around 800,000 older people are offered a free vaccine as part of the HSE seasonal influenza vaccination programme. The 2022-23 season saw a vaccine uptake of 77 per cent among people aged over 65. However, that winter still saw more than 1,700 older patients with flu being admitted to hospital.\n\nFlu-related admissions requiring an ICU stay ranged from 3.7 per 100,000 among adults aged 80 to 84 years to 19.1 per 100,000 in those aged 75 to 79 years \u00a7 Influenza-related deaths ranged from 7.1 per 100,000 among adults aged 65 to 69 years to 102.1 per 100,000 in those aged 85 years and older.\n\n\"Sometimes vaccine effectiveness can be suboptimal due to a mismatch between the content of the vaccine and the flu strains circulating that year,\" said HIQA deputy CEO Dr M\u00e1ir\u00edn Ryan.\n\n\"Vaccine effectiveness may also be reduced due to an ageing or compromised immune system. Enhanced flu vaccines have been developed in an attempt to increase vaccine effectiveness.\"\n\nThe public consultation on switching to enhanced flu vaccines for those aged 65 years and older is open for submissions until 5pm on July 11.

Our current seasonal vaccine won't cover this highly pathogenic (contagious) virus very well, so I would like to fix this and develop a universal vaccine that could protect against those viruses and allow for a swift response to any emerging pandemic threats.''\n\nDr. Vanderven said don't panic about H5N1 becoming a pandemic, but watch this space.\n\n''There is a global lens on the occurrence of H5N1 cases in both animals and people, including right here in Australia. People can be reassured experts are constantly checking on the genome of the virus to see what mutations are happening, and unlike COVID, if it does become a thing, we'll have some warning,'' Dr. Vanderven said.\n\n''We know now what to do and we have more time to control a pandemic, if and when one occurs. Importantly, if a new flu vaccine is rolled out to protect us more broadly from the flu or from a specific virus such as H5N1, then get it.''", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antibody"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immunology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_spike_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus spike protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemagglutinin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hemagglutinin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2020/flu.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614910", "eventUri": "eng-9614910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Vaccinemaker CSL Seqirus has been tasked with manufacturing the doses at its North Carolina plant.\n\n\"It utilizes a highly scalable method of production and is currently positioned to deliver up to 150 million influenza vaccine doses to support an influenza pandemic response within six months of a pandemic declaration,\" CSL Seqirus said in a release.\n\nThe doses combine bulk stockpiles of two key ingredients: an \"antigen\" targeted at the H5 portion of the H5N1 virus with an \"adjuvant\" designed to boost the immune response triggered by the vaccine.\n\nWhile manufacturing of these new bird flu doses is set to be completed by \"later this summer,\" the vaccines still may not be immediately ready for use.\n\n\"I do want to decouple availability and manufacturing completion, because there is of course that regulatory component that would be needed to either approve or authorize actual use of the doses,\" ASPR's David Boucher told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe FDA has previously approved other vaccines to prepare for potential H5N1 pandemics, including a vaccine by Seqirus. It is unclear how soon the FDA could grant authorization to clear use of the new shots.\n\n\"While CDC's current risk assessment to the general public is low, if it is determined that the U.S. population needs to be vaccinated to prevent H5N1 influenza, then the FDA will use its regulatory pathways to take the appropriate steps to ensure vaccines are available in the timeliest manner possible,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nBoucher also said that authorities have so far not decided whether to recommend use of the vaccines. It is unclear who would be prioritized for the first shots if they are eventually deemed to be needed and rolled out for the public.\n\n\"If that changes in the future, we would be looking at the population for whom vaccination would be recommended and then making any decisions on prioritization at that time,\" said Boucher.\n\nA panel of the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, which has discussed previous pandemic vaccines, is scheduled to meet in June to discuss H5N1 alongside its routine votes on recommendations for seasonal flu vaccines.\n\nWhile the CDC says the risk to the general public from H5N1 remains low for now, the agency has warned that workers in places like dairy farms and production facilities are now at higher risk of infection and it has urged the industry to take precautions.\n\nAt least three workers at U.S. dairy farms have tested positive this year after working directly with infected cows.\n\nThe latest case in Michigan developed respiratory symptoms, officials announced Thursday, which could make it easier for the virus to spread from person to person.\n\n\"Simply put, someone who's coughing may be more likely to transmit the virus than someone who has an eye infection like conjunctivitis,\" the CDC's Nirav Shah said Thursday.\n\nHowever, Shah said there is no evidence that person-to-person spread has happened so far. Contacts of the patient have so far not tested positive. Previous H5N1 spillovers around the world from different strains have also fizzled out after limited spread between people.\n\nThe CDC is now looking to see if the strain that infected the latest Michigan patient might have developed key mutations that could raise its risk of spread.\n\n\"The mere fact that this individual displayed some respiratory symptoms, again we should be alert, but in and of itself is not a cause to change course or suggest that we're at an inflection point,\" Shah said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSL_Limited", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CSL Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish flu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antigen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjuvant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flu season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/31/6a94aafb-537c-4f91-885e-d7690c8b8a1b/thumbnail/1200x630/7fc359155fe24a44260d6c967f68bb68/gettyimages-472088760.jpg?v=d7bbca61a2ddd34e0cfc8fb46aec1df3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614910", "eventUri": "eng-9614910", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

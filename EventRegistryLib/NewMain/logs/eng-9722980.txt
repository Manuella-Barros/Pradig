In his sentence LA Superior Court Judge Kerry White ordered Michl to serve her time in a California state prison. The odds of the 37-year-old Michl ever stepping outside the prison gates is pretty slim.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nThe sentence is the maximum available to the judge under California law.\n\nArrested mere days after shooting and killing the beloved studio marketer and social justice advocate in his mid-Wilshire home, Michl has been in custody since November 27, 2023 when she was arrested at the scene of the crime. Held on a $3 million bail since then, Michl plead guilty to one count of first-degree murder, and one count of first-degree burglary on June 24.\n\nLatt was \"targeted\" by Michl for \"him for being friends with a woman she had been stalking,\" the LA District Attorney's office said at the time. The woman in question is A Thousand and One director A.V. Rockwell. Michl had been stalking and threatening Rockwell for months and the filmmaker had gotten an number of restraining orders against her.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Lead With Love and a communications and marketing advisor to the likes of Netflix, Ava DuVernay's ARRAY, Warner Bros Pictures, Common, and Annapurna Pictures, Latt was shot at close range by a semi-automatic handgun in the evening as Muchl forced her way into his home. Latt's fianc\u00e9e, Hannah Lovingood, was there at the time of the attack by Michl\n\nLatt, 33, passed away from his wounds soon afterwards at a local hospital.\n\n\"Today brings a measure of closure to a deeply painful chapter for Mr. Latt's family, friends and our entire community,\" District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement after sentencing Wednesday. \"As a tireless advocate for social justice, Mr. Latt championed equality, justice and equity in our criminal legal system. Mr. Latt's ability to uplift the community left an indelible mark. His legacy will continue to inspire us to strive for a more just and inclusive society.\"\n\nWidely mourned from all segments of Hollywood, Latt came from a family with deep ties to the industry. Latt's brother is Franklin Latt, who is CAA's head of talent and the representative of top names.

(Courtesy of Sundance Institute via AP, File)LOS ANGELES (AP) - A woman who pleaded guilty to killing entertainment consultant and social justice advocate Michael Latt was sentenced to 35 years to life in prison on Wednesday. Jameelah Elena Michl had been stalking and threatening film director A.V. Rockwell and targeted Latt because he was Rockwell's friend, prosecutors and police said. Michl pleaded guilty last month to charges of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary in connection with the November attack.

He was declared dead at a hospital. Weeks later Latt's mother, Michelle Satter, received an Oscar for her work as a founding director of the Sundance Institute, and her part of the ceremony became a tribute to her son.

She also admitted to using a firearm during the attack, court records show.\n\nProsecutors said Michl did not know Latt but had targeted him for being friends with a woman she was stalking. Michl was armed with a semi-automatic handgun when she knocked on the door of Latt's home in the 900 block of Alandele Avenue, forced herself inside and shot him.\n\nLatt, 33, was taken to a hospital, where he died.\n\n\"Today brings a measure of closure to a deeply painful chapter for Mr. Latt's family, friends and our entire community,\" Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. George Gasc\u00f3n said. \"As a tireless advocate for social justice, Mr. Latt championed equality, justice and equity in our criminal legal system. Mr. Latt's ability to uplift the community left an indelible mark. His legacy will continue to inspire us to strive for a more just and inclusive society.\"\n\nLatt was the chief executive of Lead With Love, an entertainment marketing consulting firm he founded in 2019 with an emphasis on elevating Black creatives and other underrepresented voices in Hollywood.\n\nAuthorities say Latt's killing was the culmination of a series of threats made by Michl, who had been stalking film director A.V. Rockwell. Michl had worked as an extra on Rockwell's film \"A Thousand and One\" and had become obsessed with the director, according to court records.\n\nAt first, the attempts at interaction seemed innocent. She sent Rockwell a gift box when the film wrapped production in 2021. When the movie won the grand jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival a year later, Michl sent an email to a producer on the film saying she thought highly of Rockwell and the film.\n\nBut Michl's admiration for the director took a dark turn in emails sent over the next several months. When Rockwell didn't respond, Michl emailed her saying she would kill herself and told Rockwell she owned a gun.\n\nThe emails led Rockwell to request a restraining order against Michl in June 2023. Rockwell wrote in court documents that \"panic attacks caused by the anxiety and fear for my safety has meant that I have been unable to return to work.

In his sentence LA Superior Court Judge Kerry White ordered Michl to serve her time in a California state prison. The odds of the 37-year-old Michl ever stepping outside the prison gates is pretty slim.\n\nThe sentence is the maximum available to the judge under California law.\n\nArrested mere days after shooting and killing the beloved studio marketer and social justice advocate in his mid-Wilshire home, Michl has been in custody since November 27, 2023 when she was arrested at the scene of the crime. Held on a $3 million bail since then, Michl plead guilty to one count of first-degree murder, and one count of first-degree burglary on June 24.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Lead With Love and a communications and marketing advisor to the likes of Netflix, Ava DuVernay's ARRAY, Warner Bros Pictures, Common, and Annapurna Pictures, Latt was shot at close range by a semi-automatic handgun in the evening as Muchl forced her way into his home. Latt's fianc\u00e9e, Hannah Lovingood, was there at the time of the attack by Michl\n\nLatt, 33, passed away from his wounds soon afterwards at a local hospital.\n\n\"Today brings a measure of closure to a deeply painful chapter for Mr. Latt's family, friends and our entire community,\" District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement after sentencing Wednesday. \"As a tireless advocate for social justice, Mr. Latt championed equality, justice and equity in our criminal legal system. Mr. Latt's ability to uplift the community left an indelible mark. His legacy will continue to inspire us to strive for a more just and inclusive society.\"\n\nWidely mourned from all segments of Hollywood, Latt came from a family with deep ties to the industry. Latt's brother is Franklin Latt, who is CAA's head of talent and the representative of top names. Latt's mother is Michelle Satter, who was honored with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at this year's Governors Awards for her decades of work on behalf of the Sundance Institute.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dominic_patten@deadline.com", "name": "Dominic Patten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superior court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alec Baldwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manslaughter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Rockwell and targeted Latt because he was Rockwell's friend, prosecutors and police said. Michl pleaded guilty last month to charges of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary in connection with the November attack.\n\nLatt was a consultant whose company focused on social impact in film and entertainment. He worked with \"Selma\" director Ava DuVernay and \"Black Panther\" director Ryan Coogler, among many others, and his death was mourned throughout Hollywood.\n\n\"As a tireless advocate for social justice, Mr. Latt championed equality, justice and equity in our criminal legal system,\" Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said in a statement. \"Mr. Latt's ability to uplift the community left an indelible mark. His legacy will continue to inspire us to strive for a more just and inclusive society.\"\n\nProsecutors alleged that Michl knocked on the door of Latt's Los Angeles home on Nov. 27, 2023, forced her way in and fatally shot him with a semi-automatic handgun. He was declared dead at a hospital.\n\nWeeks later Latt's mother, Michelle Satter, received an honorary Oscar for her work as a founding director of the Sundance Institute, and her part of the ceremony became a tribute to her son.\n\nCoogler, who presented the award, described her son as Satter's \"greatest gift to the world.\" Satter told the audience she wanted to share the award with Latt, who always \"led with love.\"\n\nMichl's public defender, Kimberly Wong, read a statement for her client during Wednesday's proceeding.\n\n\"Ms. Michl changed her plea to guilty in order to take responsibility for her actions and do the right thing for all involved,\" Wong told the court. \"At the time of the shooting she had been homeless on the streets of Los Angeles for nine months and struggling with multiple traumatic events. She is deeply saddened by the tremendous amount of pain she has caused to so many and hopes that her change in plea will help everyone to be able to heal and move forward.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.V._Rockwell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.V.

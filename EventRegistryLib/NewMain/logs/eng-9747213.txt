Ministry of Civil Aviation ensures smooth travel adjustments amid backlog\n\nAirline systems at airports across the country are returning to normal a day after a global computer outage caused widespread disruptions. On Friday, airports witnessed chaotic scenes after several flights were either delayed or cancelled. The government on Saturday said efforts were underway to clear the backlog. Here are some of the top updates:\n\n\"Since 3 AM in the night, Airline systems across airports have started working normally. Flight operations are going smoothly now. There is a backlog because of disruptions yesterday, and it is getting cleared gradually. By noon today, we expect all issues to be resolved,\" the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement. \"We are constantly monitoring the operations at our airports and also with the airlines ensuring travel readjustments and refunds are taken care of. We thank you for your patience,\" it added.\n\nSeveral airports in India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, encountered issues with issuing boarding passes as IndiGo flights experienced cancellations and rescheduling. Airlines indicated that while departures and arrivals were gradually resuming\n\nThree major airlines in India, namely Indigo, Akasa, and SpiceJet, faced significant disruptions recently. While Akasa and SpiceJet managed to avoid cancellations, Indigo bore the brunt with approximately 200 flights canceled yesterday and around 95 flights canceled today.\n\nOverall, about 250 flights were affected on Friday due to operational challenges. Budget carrier Akasa Air said late on Friday it \"successfully\" navigated a daylong system outage due to the Microsoft Azure technical issue that affected operations across the global aviation industry.\n\nIn one of the biggest-ever IT outages, an update of a product offered by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike triggered problems with Microsoft's Windows across the planet, hitting operations at financial sector companies and airlines while hospital operations got postponed and some television channels went off air. In India, it led to the crashing of airline check-in systems, causing delays and cancellation of dozens of flights. IndiGo alone cancelled around 200 flights. Hundreds of other flights got delayed as bookings, check-in and boarding moved to manual mode.\n\nAirports from Chennai to Delhi witnessed chaotic scenes as harried passengers argued with airline staff over either not informing about delays and cancellations or not giving them alternate flights. Web check-in services were not available, leading to long queues at check-in counters and over-crowded lounges at several airports. IndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, SpiceJet and Air India Express posted messages on X saying they were facing issues.\n\nPassengers were issued hand-written boarding passes and the entire process of doing manual ticketing as well as passenger and luggage check-in took 30-40 minutes per person, some travellers said. According to preliminary data put out by aviation analytics firm Cirium on the global IT disruption in the afternoon, 56 out of 3,652 flights scheduled from Indian destinations were cancelled.\n\nServices like bookings, check-ins and boarding moved to manual mode and took longer than expected time. This led to long queues at airports, passengers, including those who were travelling due to some emergency reasons, were seen complaining about the lack of information about their flights.\n\nThe impact was more on passengers flying out of high-density airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai. \"A global outage with the Navitaire Departure Control System (DCS) has been affecting operations of some airlines across their network, including BLR Airport since 10:40 IST on July 19, 2024. Indigo, Akasa, and SpiceJet in T1 and Air India Express in T2 are among the impacted airlines,\" a Bengaluru airport spokesperson said.\n\nThe Common Use Terminal Equipment and Common Use Self Service systems also experienced disruptions, the airport operator said, adding that in response to this situation, IndiGo, Air India Express, SpiceJet, and Akasa have taken proactive measures by initiating manual check-ins to ensure minimal disruption to passengers and flight schedules.\n\nOn Friday, Union Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu assured passengers that his ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation using manual methods to ensure minimal disruption. \"We have instructed all airlines and airport authorities to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance,\" Civil Aviation Minister Naidu said.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, international flight operations have not been affected so far,\" a BIAL source told Moneycontrol.\n\n\"A global outage with the Navitaire Departure Control System (DCS) has been impacting operations for some airlines across their networks, including Bengaluru airport, since 10:40am on July 19, 2024\" , a BIAL spokesperson said.\n\n\"IndiGo, Akasa, and SpiceJet in T1, and Air India Express in T2, are among the impacted airlines. The Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE) and Common Use Self Service (CUSS) systems are also experiencing disruptions. IndiGo, Air India Express, SpiceJet, and Akasa have taken proactive measures by initiating manual check-ins to minimise disruption to passengers and flight schedules\", the spokesperson said.\n\nAlso, read: Microsoft outage: Indigo issues handwritten boarding pass, passenger's post goes viral\n\nOfficials said the issue continues on Friday night, leaving many flyers stranded at the airport. Sources said there were long queues at the airport, especially at IndiGo counters, and passengers engaged in arguments with airport staff over the delays. Sources said check-in was being done manually due to the Microsoft outage.\n\nMany have expressed their frustration on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, IndiGo in a statement said they are working to minimise the impact of global cloud software outage on flight operations.\n\n\"IndiGo is currently experiencing delays and cancellations due to a global outage affecting its cloud server software and provider. This outage, which began on July 19, 2024, has severely disrupted airline operations by impacting critical systems used for flight operations, passenger check-in, and baggage handling. Airlines, airports, and other transport systems worldwide are facing similar issues\" a statement from IndiGo said.\n\n\"Following rapid measures by IndiGo teams to switch to manual and backup systems, operations at major Indian airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, are now under control amidst the widespread disruptions caused by the software outage. IndiGo has activated 'war rooms' at four metro airports to manage operations. The airline's staff are prioritising passengers with departures within the next 120 minutes to ensure flights can continue with minimal delays\", it said.\n\nAlso, read: Microsoft mega outage: IndiGo says operations at major airports under control\n\n\"Additional measures have been implemented to manage the situation effectively. Customers with cancelled flights are advised not to go to the airports and are being offered alternate arrangements where possible. The airline is closely monitoring the situation, and further decisions regarding flight operations will be made based on updates from its cloud service provider.

Several airports suspended operations as services like bookings, check-in and boarding process including issuance of boarding passes were carried out manually, thereby taking longer than expected time and leading to long queues at airports. It caused chaos for several low-cost airlines, posing security concerns.\n\nThe outage hit booking and check-in services of several airlines, including Air India, IndiGo, Akasa Airlines and SpiceJet. Flyers have been advised to get to the airport well in advance, as manual check-ins take more time. They have also been urged to carry dry food items and water in case the wait stretches.\n\nAirlines are posting updates on their social media handles to warn passengers about delays.\n\nAdvising passengers to cooperate with airport staff during this period of disruption, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) said it is \"committed\" to minimising inconvenience and ensuring well-being of all travellers.\n\nThe airports and airline operations, whose systems were based on Microsoft, faced significant disruptions since about 10.40 am on Friday. IndiGo, SpiceJet , Air India and Akasa saw disruptions in their online check-in and boarding processes across their networks, forcing them to switch to manual mode.\n\nAirlines are facing issues in making fresh bookings; urging passengers not to make multiple bookings for a journey and urging them not to contact call centres -- which are facing tremendous call volumes due to flight delays -- unless their flight is scheduled to depart in 24 hours.\n\nUnion Minister for Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu said his Ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation arising out of a global Microsoft outage, which severely impacted airport and airline operations in the country. The Civil Aviation Ministry in collaboration with AAI has implemented manual backup systems to maintain operational continuity, Naidu said in a statement.\n\nAccording to officials, the country's key airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai, are crippled due to the massive tech outage. Delhi airport said some of its services have been impacted and it is working to minimise the inconvenience to fliers. Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport reported an average delay of 51 minutes, Delhi's IGI Airport saw its services being delayed by nearly 40 minutes.\n\nAt Bengaluru, 90 per cent of flights operating out of Terminal 1 have been impacted and airlines are using manual methods to check passengers in. As many as 160 flights were affected in Hyderabad airport.\n\nAs check-in is being done manually, passengers were asked to report to airports well in advance -- about three hours (even for domestic flights), to factor in the slow processes. While so far there was no flight cancellation here and flights were delayed as check-in was being done manually. DGCA has asked airlines to inform passengers about delays as much as possible given the technical challenges being faced.\n\nMost airlines took to social media platforms to share the update with fliers. Air India said its \"digital systems have been impacted temporarily due to the current Microsoft outage, resulting in delays\". IndiGo warned that check-ins \"may be slower and queues longer\".\n\nThe low-cost carrier also said the option to rebook a flight or claim a refund is temporarily unavailable. SpiceJet said it is working closely with authorities to minimise disruptions. Akasa Air said its online services have been affected. Vistara, too, said it is facing technical challenges and is working to fix it at the earliest.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport saw as many as 23 flights -- 12 departures and 11 arrivals -- including Indigo's flights to Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru being cancelled.\n\n\"We are closely working with all our stakeholders to minimise the inconvenience to our flyers. You may please get in touch with the airline concerned for updates on your flight information. We thank you for your support and understanding,\" the airport, run by GMR, said in a post on social media platform.\n\nIn Bengaluru, Indigo, Air India Express, SpiceJet and Akasa issued handwritten boarding passes. Passengers complained of harrowing time following the disruption in flight services and were seen anxiously waiting for their delayed flights. The lounge of the KIA was overcrowded due to the disruption in flight services.\n\n\"A global outage with the Navitaire Departure Control System (NDCS) has been affecting operations of some airlines across their network, including BLR Airport since 10.40 IST on July 19, 2024,\" a Bangalore International Airport Ltd spokesperson said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "dailypioneer.com",

They are taking about 30-40 minutes to process a passenger's ticket. How will they do it for all, They don't have a reply,\" said a passenger.\n\nIndiGo has cancelled around 200 flights, however, the number of delayed flights can't be quantified, said a source.\n\n\"The Microsoft/CrowdStrike outage has taken down most airports in India. I got my first hand-written boarding pass today,\" said IndiGo passenger Akshay Kothari in a post on X displaying his manual boarding pass.\n\nAccording to preliminary data put out by aviation analytics firm Cirium on the global IT disruption in the afternoon, 56 flights were cancelled out of 3,652 flights scheduled from Indian destinations. This does not include inbound flights to India.\n\nUnion Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu assured the passengers that the ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation using manual methods to ensure minimal disruption.\n\n\"We have instructed all airlines and airport authorities to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance,\" Naidu said.\n\nMinister of State for Civil Aviation Murlidhar Mohol said the ministry and aviation safety regulator DGCA are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nThe minister said that instructions have been issued to private airlines to promptly inform passengers about the disruptions.\n\nThe impact was more on passengers flying out of high-density airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai.\n\n\"A global outage with the Navitaire Departure Control System (DCS) has been affecting operations of some airlines across their network, including BLR Airport since 10:40 IST on July 19, 2024. Indigo, Akasa, and SpiceJet in T1 and Air India Express in T2 are among the impacted airlines,\" a Bengaluru airport spokesperson said.\n\nThe Common Use Terminal Equipment (CUTE) and Common Use Self Service (CUSS) systems are also experiencing disruptions, the airport operator said adding that in response to this situation, IndiGo, Air India Express, SpiceJet and Akasa have taken proactive measures by initiating manual check-ins to ensure minimal disruption to passengers and flight schedules.\n\n\"Due to a major global system outage, all gate screens at DEL (Delhi airport) blank. Flights are being held at the gate. Some gates boarding pax (passengers) and holding on board, some flights holding pax at gate itself, which is better. Seems to be impacting many airports and airlines,\" Sanjiv Kapoor, executive vice-president (strategies) of Saudia Airlines and former CEO of Jet Airways 2.0, said in a post on X.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport saw as many as 23 flights -- 12 departures and 11 arrivals -- including IndiGo's flights to Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru being cancelled.\n\n\"We are closely working with all our stakeholders to minimise the inconvenience to our flyers. You may please get in touch with the airline concerned for updates on your flight information. We thank you for your support and understanding,\" the airport, run by GMR, said in a post on social media platform X.\n\nEarlier in the day, IndiGo said its systems were impacted by the Microsoft outage and during this time, booking, check-in, access to boarding pass, and some flights were impacted.\n\nServices of budget carrier Akasa were also impacted.\n\n\"Due to infrastructure issues with our service provider, some of our online services, including booking, check-in and manage booking services will be temporarily unavailable. Currently we are following manual check-in and boarding processes at the airports,\" Akasa said in a post on X.\n\nSpiceJet also said that it was experiencing technical challenges with the service provider affecting online services including booking, check-in, and managing booking functionalities.\n\nCentre Issues Advisory\n\nThe Centre today issued an advisory on the outage of Microsoft Windows owing to CrowdStrike agent 'Falcon Sensor' update.\n\nUnion Minister for Railways, I&B, Electronics & IT Ashwini Vaishnav informed about the advisory on X social media platform, saying \"CERT-In advisory on the outage of Microsoft\".\n\nThe CERT-In said it has been reported that Windows hosts related to Crowd strike agent \"Falcon Sensor\" are facing outages and getting crashed due to a recent update received in the product.\n\nThe concerned Windows hosts are experiencing a \"Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)\" related to Falcon Sensor.\n\n\"The issues occurred in the latest update of CrowdStrike and the changes have been reverted by the CrowdStrike Team,\" said the cyber security agency, suggesting steps for customers to mitigate the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, former Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar said that he hopes Microsoft will restore its services soon. \"Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Suite are used by millions of Indians. Any disruption on this platform disrupts the business and operations of many companies. The government will work with Microsoft to ensure that services are restored as soon as possible,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "kashmirobserver.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kashmir

Flights that operated did so with long delays at choked airports with serpentine queues.\n\nManual processes were followed as servers were down and no DigiYatra worked at entrance.Most airlines issued hand-written boarding cards, with cards being stamped security cleared. No information boards were working to indicate boarding gate numbers for different flights.\n\nFresh bookings and re-bookings (for passengers of cancelled or badly delayed flights) were also impacted for many airlines that use the affected IT system, including IndiGo, Air India Express, Akasa and SpiceJet. Others were also affected in varying measures. The outage started around 10.40 am and was ongoing till late night. Airlines urged passengers not to contact call centres, where phones were ringing non-stop, unless their flight was within 24 hours.\n\nRecounting most passengers' experience, Shiv Shivkumar, operating partner at Advent International and former PepsiCo (India) chairman, said on social media: \"Absolute chaos at Delhi T3. All systems down. All airlines impacted. Scanners & DigiYatra not working. Counter computers very limited.

Those booked on cancelled flights were advised not to reach airports. \"Flights are cancelled due to cascading effect of the worldwide travel system outage, beyond our control. The option to rebook/claim a refund is temporarily unavailable,\" IndiGo said on X.\n\nUnion aviation minister Rammohan Naidu said Indian airports are facing unexpected delays because of the outage. \"I have directed airport authorities and airlines to be compassionate and provide extra seating, water and food to passengers affected by delays... instructed (them) to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance,\" Naidu said. In a statement, Adani Airports said: \"During this (outage) booking, check-in, access to boarding passes and flights are likely to be impacted.

IndiGo alone cancelled around 200 flights. Hundreds of other flights got delayed as bookings, check-in and boarding moved to manual mode.\n\nThe Indian financial and payments systems remained largely unaffected, though about 10 banks and NBFCs faced minor disruptions, which have either been resolved or are being fixed, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) -- the sector regulator -- said.\n\nAirports from Chennai to Delhi witnessed chaotic scenes as harried passengers argued with airline staff over either not informing about delays and cancellations or not giving them alternate flights. Web check-in services were not available, leading to long queues at check-in counters and over-crowded lounges at several airports.\n\nIndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, SpiceJet and Air India Express posted messages on X saying they were facing issues.\n\nPassengers were issued hand-written boarding passes and the entire process of doing manual ticketing as well as passenger and luggage check-in took 30-40 minutes per person, some travellers said.\n\nAccording to preliminary data put out by aviation analytics firm Cirium on the global IT disruption in the afternoon, 56 out of 3,652 flights scheduled from Indian destinations were cancelled.\n\nAirlines slowly began resuming some operations but making up for the delayed or cancelled flights may take some time.\n\nUnion Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu assured passengers that his ministry and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are actively managing the situation using manual methods to ensure minimal disruption.\n\n\"The reasons for this outage has been identified and updates have been released to resolve the issue,\" Minister for Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said.\n\nWhile some brokerage firms, including Nuvama Wealth Management, Edelweiss Mutual Fund, Motilal Oswal, IIFL Securities, 5Paisa Capital, and Angel Broking, faced technical issues, stock exchanges NSE and BSE said their operations were running normally.\n\nAuto major Maruti Suzuki India said it had briefly halted production and dispatch operations due to the outage.\n\nTata Motors passenger EV arm in a post on X (formerly Twitter) said telephone lines at its contact centre are not functioning and it is working hard to resolve the issue.\n\nIT major Wipro said while its own operations remained unaffected, it was assisting clients in the US and Europe who faced issues.\n\n\"Earlier today, a Crowdstrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally. We are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nVaishnaw said the IT ministry is continually in touch with Microsoft, which in turn is actively working with impacted entities.\n\n\"In addition, CERT-In is coordinating with CISOs of critical infrastructure entities. All impacted entities are working to bring up their systems. In many cases, systems are partially up,\" the minister said in a post on X.\n\nMeanwhile, CERT-In has issued an advisory on the Microsoft outage caused by the Crowdstrike update, and rated its severity as \"critical\".\n\n\"CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts...This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\" CrowdStrike President and CEO George Kurtz posted on X.\n\nAs services like bookings, check-ins and boarding moved to manual mode, taking longer than expected time and leading to long queues at airports, passengers, including those who were travelling due to some emergency reasons, were seen complaining about the lack of information about their flights and venting out ire on airline staff.\n\n\"We have instructed all airlines and airport authorities to keep passengers informed about their flight status and provide necessary assistance,\" Civil Aviation Minister Naidu said.\n\nThe impact was more on passengers flying out of high-density airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Chennai.\n\n\"A global outage with the Navitaire Departure Control System (DCS) has been affecting operations of some airlines across their network, including BLR Airport since 10:40 IST on July 19, 2024. Indigo, Akasa, and SpiceJet in T1 and Air India Express in T2 are among the impacted airlines,\" a Bengaluru airport spokesperson said.\n\nThe Common Use Terminal Equipment and Common Use Self Service systems are also experiencing disruptions, the airport operator said, adding that in response to this situation, IndiGo, Air India Express, SpiceJet, and Akasa have taken proactive measures by initiating manual check-ins to ensure minimal disruption to passengers and flight schedules.\n\n\"Due to a major global system outage, all gate screens at DEL (Delhi airport) are blank. Flights are being held at the gate. Some gates boarding pax (passengers) and holding on board, some flights holding pax at gate itself, which is better. Seems to be impacting many airports and airlines,\" Sanjiv Kapoor, executive vice-president (strategies) of Saudia Airlines and former CEO of Jet Airways 2.0, said in a post on X.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport saw as many as 23 flights -- 12 departures and 11 arrivals -- including IndiGo's flights to Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Ahmedabad, and Bengaluru being cancelled.

Companies, banks, airlines and hospitals were among those that mainly bore the brunt worldwide.\n\nNow, affected businesses and services are recovering, but Crowdstrike's CEO has said it could take \"some time\" before all systems resume operations normally. In a statement on X, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz said the company is working with customers \"impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts\".\n\n\"This is not a security incident or cyberattack. The issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\" he wrote in a tweet on Friday.\n\nWhich services have resumed and which remain disrupted in India? We explain.\n\nThese services are back\n\nAirlines in India were worst affected due to the global IT outage on Friday, with big players like IndiGo being forced to cancel multiple flights.\n\nA day later, the civil aviation ministry issued a statement saying that airline systems across airports have started \"working normally\".\n\n\"Flight operations are now running smoothly. While there is a backlog due to yesterday's disruptions, it is gradually being cleared. By noon today, we expect all issues to be resolved,\" the ministry said in a statement earlier in the day.\n\nIndigo has urged the passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airports. The domestic airline said that while their systems are \"back online\", they are \"diligently working\" to resume normal operations which could extend into the weekend.\n\nIndigo had cancelled about 200 flights yesterday, and several others were delayed as manual check-ins significantly slowed the passenger processing.\n\nAirlines such as IndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, SpiceJet, and Air India took to social media to flag the technical issues they faced.\n\nAt several airports, including Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, long queues of passengers were seen as web check-in services went down, leading to manual ticketing process.\n\nPassengers were handed handwritten boarding passes and had to wait about 30-40 minutes for manual ticketing and luggage check-in, causing frustration and overcrowding at airports, reported NDTV.\n\nAs the day passed, operations started returning on track slowly.\n\nSpiceJet announced late on Friday that it had resolved the technical issues and resumed normal operations.\n\nBudget carrier Akasa Air said late last night that its online services, including booking, check-in and boarding systems, were \"up and running\".\n\nBesides aviation, about 10 banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India were affected by the global outage. However, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the minor disruptions faced by the financial sector were largely resolved.\n\nAirlines are now dealing with the backlog caused due to flight disruptions yesterday.\n\nAt Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI), IndiGo counters continued to witness long queues today, as per a Business Today report.\n\nEarlier in the day, a passenger travelling to London from Delhi told ANI that his flight was delayed by at least \"half an hour\". \"There is a long queue outside the airport. Most of the flights are delayed&mldr;\"\n\nThe Digi Yatra system is still non-operational, prompting manual entries at the Delhi airport. International travellers are unable to print out their boarding passes and have to be issued manual ones inside the IGI airport, as per the NDTV report.\n\nMumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is also reporting large crowds but operations are running better than yesterday. However, two flights had to be cancelled and many global flights were rescheduled on Saturday, the report added.\n\nAt Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport, normal operations have resumed but the impact of Friday's delays is visible today as long queues continue.\n\nALSO READ: Microsoft outage: Which airports have been worst-affected? How are they dealing with the crisis?\n\nWhich services remained unaffected?\n\nThe income tax department portal did not report any major disruptions due to the global IT outage. \"Don't think there are any issues at present,\" the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said late on Friday.\n\nSeveral Indian asset management companies, including SBI MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, Axis MF and Zerodha MF, remained insulated against the Microsoft outage.\n\nThe Indian stock exchanges were also unaffected unlike the London Stock Exchange, which said its real-time platforms were impacted by the outage caused by \"a third-party technical issue.\" It was later resolved.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [],

By noon today, we expect all issues to be resolved,\" reads an official communique posted on social media by federal civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu.\n\nThe Microsoft outage was triggered after cyber-security firm CrowdStrike issued a faulty software update to the U.S. tech giant. It affected customers using Microsoft's Windows operating system.\n\nThe outage threw life out of gear in airports across India, besides leading to widespread cancellation of flights.\n\nLocal media reports said a private airline -- IndiGo, which has the largest share of domestic passenger traffic in India, alone canceled 287 flights. Apart from IndiGo, two other private airlines Akasa and SpiceJet faced significant disruptions.\n\n\"We are constantly monitoring the operations in our airports and also with the airlines ensuring travel readjustment and refunds are taken care of,\" the ministry said.\n\nAirports across the country, including in Delhi and Mumbai witnessed chaotic scenes on Friday over issuing boarding passes, cancellations and rescheduling of flights. Web check-in services were not available, which led to long queues at check-in counters and overcrowded lounges at several airports. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Civil Aviation (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiGo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IndiGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiceJet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpiceJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747213", "eventUri": "eng-9747213", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 18}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Due to this, airline check-in systems crashed in India, resulting in several flight cancellations and delays. About 200 flights were cancelled by IndiGo alone, while hundreds more were delayed due to the severe slowdown in manual check-in procedures.\n\nAirlines such as IndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, SpiceJet, and Air India Express acknowledged the issues via social media. Passengers received handwritten boarding passes, and the manual ticketing and luggage check-in process extended to 30-40 minutes per person, leading to frustration and overcrowded lounges.

Flight operations are going smoothly now. There is a backlog because of disruptions yesterday, and it is getting cleared gradually. By noon today, we expect all issues to be resolved.\"\n\nThe outage of Microsoft 365 and Azure services had a significant impact on the aviation sector, particularly affecting operations for airlines such as IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air. The disruption led to delays and cancellations as airline operators grappled with non-functional systems, forcing them to resort to manual processes to manage their flights.\n\nDue to the technical glitch, passengers faced disruptions at major airports of the country including Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai among others. The outage had reportedly affected more than 400 flights at the Delhi Airport.

Although the situation has improved significantly since Friday's chaotic scenes, passengers continue to face challenges, particularly at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI).\n\nAt Delhi's IGI Airport's Terminal 3, passengers experienced some improvement today, but a few problems persist. Yesterday, the automatic self-drop baggage and check-in machines were non-functional, causing long queues outside Gate No. 5 in Terminal 3. While many passengers can print out their boarding passes today, international travellers still face issues with boarding pass generation, with some being issued manual passes inside the airport.\n\nThe Digi Yatra machines at Gates 1-3, which facilitate seamless entry, remain non-operational, necessitating manual entries. Display boards showing wait times, flight schedules, and other crucial information, which were down yesterday, are now functional. However, the overall system has not yet fully recovered, as confirmed by airport officials.\n\nMumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport fared better than its counterparts in Delhi and Bengaluru. Although long queues were reported, operations are running more smoothly today. Nonetheless, two flights, one to Varanasi and one to Kochi, were cancelled this morning, and several international flights were rescheduled. This is an improvement from yesterday when nine domestic flights, all operated by IndiGo, were cancelled. IndiGo has warned of potential cancellations today but expressed optimism that yesterday's disruption will not be repeated as the Microsoft outage was not reported today.\n\nGlobal Outage\n\nThe outage, attributed to an update by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, disrupted Microsoft's Windows systems worldwide, affecting financial institutions, airlines, hospitals, and media channels. In India, this caused airline check-in systems to crash, leading to delays and the cancellation of dozens of flights. IndiGo alone cancelled around 200 flights, with hundreds more delayed as manual check-in procedures significantly slowed the process.\n\nThe Indian financial sector experienced minor disruptions at about ten banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which have largely been resolved, according to the Reserve Bank of India. However, the outage's impact on airports from Chennai to Delhi was severe, with passengers facing long queues due to unavailable web check-in services and manual ticketing processes.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAirlines such as IndiGo, Akasa Air, Vistara, Air India, SpiceJet, and Air India Express acknowledged the issues via social media. Passengers received handwritten boarding passes, and the manual ticketing and luggage check-in process extended to 30-40 minutes per person, leading to frustration and overcrowded lounges.\n\nOther Airports\n\nBesides Delhi and Mumbai, high-density airports like Bengaluru and Chennai saw the most significant impacts. At Bengaluru's Kempegowda International Airport, airlines such as IndiGo, Akasa, SpiceJet, and Air India Express initiated manual check-ins to ensure minimal disruption. Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport experienced cancellations of 23 flights, including IndiGo flights to Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Ahmedabad, and Bengaluru.\n\nMinisterial Assurances\n\nUnion Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu assured that the ministry and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) are managing the situation using manual methods to minimise disruption. Minister for Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw confirmed that the outage's cause had been identified and updates released to resolve the issue.\n\nCrowdStrike confirmed the problem was due to a

Flight operations are going smoothly now,\" Naidu stated in a press release.\n\nThe aviation ministry continues to monitor operations at airports to ensure travel adjustments and refunds are managed efficiently, the minister added. Meanwhile, Air India confirmed that none of its flights were canceled on Saturday due to the outage, although some delays were experienced. \"Air India's resilient IT infrastructure remained unaffected and continues to function as normal,\" said an Air India spokesperson.\n\nDespite Microsoft's announcement on Friday that services had been restored, several Indian airports continued to experience technical glitches on Saturday. Passengers faced significant disruptions at major airports, including Mumbai, New Delhi, and Chennai. Long queues at check-in counters and slow check-ins were reported, with the DigiYatra system, which enables contactless air travel, remaining offline.\n\nThe technical problems began on July 19 due to a large outage caused by a glitch in CrowdStrike's Falcon Sensor threat-monitoring software, which led to crashes in Microsoft's Windows operating system. CrowdStrike has since rolled out fixes to address the issue.\n\nUnnamed sources at Delhi airport reported that IndiGo still had long lines at its counters on Saturday due to ongoing system disruptions. A passenger at Indira Gandhi International Airport told ANI that most flights were delayed. \"I am travelling to London, and my flight is delayed by at least half an hour. There is a long queue outside the airport,\" they said.\n\nPassengers at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport also faced significant issues. One passenger, travelling from Mumbai to Bengaluru, reported that their flight was canceled, leading to an overnight wait without proper accommodation.\n\nIndiGo, SpiceJet, Air India, and Vistara faced substantial disruptions on Friday, with IndiGo canceling about 200 flights across India due to the global system outage. Despite Microsoft's restoration efforts, IndiGo continued to operate manually, issuing boarding passes and conducting the boarding process without electronic systems, causing further delays.\n\nFlights at Chennai Airport were also disrupted for the second consecutive day. A passenger named Prabakaran, scheduled to fly to the Maldives, faced uncertainty due to flight cancellations and expressed concerns about his job security.\n\nAnother passenger, a medical doctor from Sri Lanka, was unable to find a flight to Bhubaneswar and had to return to Sri Lanka, further highlighting the ongoing chaos caused by the outage.\n\nThe widespread outage impacted numerous sectors

The ministry assured that all travel adjustments and refund processes are being addressed.\n\n\"Since 3 am, airline systems across airports have started working normally. Flight operations are going smoothly now. There is a backlog because of disruptions yesterday, and it is getting cleared gradually. By noon today, we expect all issues to be resolved,\" stated the Aviation Ministry.\n\nHowever, significant disruptions were still evident at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport in Delhi on Saturday morning, as the Digi Yatra system, a biometric-based boarding system, remained non-operational. Long queues formed at the departure terminals as passengers struggled with manual check-ins. Airport authorities deployed additional staff to assist travelers and manage the congestion.\n\nBetween 6-7 AM, the system continued to experience glitches while issuing boarding passes, although the situation improved later in the day. Despite the initial chaos, most flights managed to stay on schedule, with the waiting period at Terminal 3 departures averaging around 3 to 5 minutes, a marked improvement from Friday's widespread delays.\n\nThe global IT outage had significant repercussions, disrupting airline operations worldwide. Airports and airlines rely heavily on Windows-based systems for various functions, including check-ins, baggage handling, and security clearances. The outage underscored the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to software issues.\n\nAt IGI Airport, the impact was immediate and severe. The disruption of the Digi Yatra system necessitated a return to manual processes, slowing down operations and straining airport staff and resources.\n\nThe outage of Microsoft 365 and Azure services led to delays and cancellations for hundreds of flights, including those operated by IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, and Akasa Air, as airline operators switched to manual processes. Over 400 flights at Delhi airport faced delays, and several passengers shared images of handwritten boarding passes on social media.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_units_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrative units of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Civil_Aviation_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Civil Aviation (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akasa_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Akasa Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baggage_handling_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baggage handling system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boarding pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiGo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IndiGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiceJet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpiceJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninoy_Aquino_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ninoy Aquino International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation_Authorities", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Aviation Authorities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sirius-Digitech-66.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747213", "eventUri": "eng-9747213", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

However, two flights -- one to Varanasi and one to Kochi -- were cancelled this morning, and several international flights were rescheduled.

Even after entering the flight, the plane did not depart for at least an hour,\" said Kumar. He said his flight finally took off around 4.45pm - more than two hours late. \"There was complete confusion, passengers had no idea what was happening anymore. Even airline staff were not able to tell us much.\"\n\nThe Delhi Airport tweeted: \"Due to the global IT issue, some of the services at the Delhi Airport were temporarily impacted. We are closely working with all our stakeholders to minimise the inconvenience to our flyers.\" It further asked passengers to get in touch with airlines for an updated flight status. Airlines were also using social media to update passengers about a change in flight timings.\n\nAt least 92 cancelled flights - either departing from or bound for Delhi -- were of IndiGo alone, the airline's website showed.\n\nTo be sure, other airlines did not share the number of flights grounded due to the outage in Delhi. Officials said the total number of departing or arriving flights cancelled was well over 100.\n\nSome flights, including a SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Darbhanga, were cancelled due to separate technical issues, even as the airline said it was minimally impacted by the outage. Ahmad Arzoo, a passenger posted on X: \"Complete chaos at T3 Delhi. SpiceJet has cancelled DBR bound flight. My son is stuck there no communication from SpiceJet people how to come out from terminal.\" Airport officials said, though it is a silent airport, airline staff were making announcements for passengers on their own, with whiteboards provided wherever required.\n\n\"These whiteboards were being used to share flight timings with passengers, as the normal display screens were not working properly,\" said an official at the airport, who asked not to named.\n\nAirport officials said operations were partially restored after 3.30pm, with some screens returning back to normal and some airlines able to carry out web check-ins again. However, others were still reliant on manual check-ins late into the night.\n\n\"From 3.30pm onwards, we saw partial restoration of operations, but some airlines, including IndiGo, were still doing manual check-ins till 9.30 pm. There was also the cascading effect of delayed flights, which despite partial restorations, continued till late on Friday and is likely to extend till Saturday too,\" the official said.\n\nIndiGo, which appeared to be the worst-hit airline, said it has set up a \"war room\" at IGI airport, with staff prioritising passengers whose departures were scheduled in the coming two hours.\n\nSpiceJet, Akasa and Air India, in separate statements, said that Friday's delays impacted online services through most of the day.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiGo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IndiGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiceJet", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SpiceJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boarding_pass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boarding pass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Check-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Patna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darbhanga", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darbhanga"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darbhanga"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/19/1600x900/Stranded-passengers-at-Terminal-3---Vipin-Kumar-HT_1721412721781.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747213", "eventUri": "eng-9747213", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1205, "textEnd": 1212}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Although the situation has improved significantly since Friday's chaotic scenes, passengers continue to face challenges, particularly at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI).\n\nAt Delhi's IGI Airport's Terminal 3, passengers experienced some improvement today, but a few problems persist. Yesterday, the automatic self-drop baggage and check-in machines were non-functional, causing long queues outside Gate No. 5 in Terminal 3. While many passengers can print out their boarding passes today, international travellers still face issues with boarding pass generation, with some being issued manual passes inside the airport.\n\nThe Digi Yatra machines at Gates 1-3, which facilitate seamless entry, remain non-operational, necessitating manual entries. Display boards showing wait times, flight schedules, and other crucial information, which were down yesterday, are now functional. However, the overall system has not yet fully recovered, as confirmed by airport officials.\n\nMumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport fared better than its counterparts in Delhi and Bengaluru. Although long queues were reported, operations are running more smoothly today.

She said she must wait a month before her daughter can be screened for blood-borne diseases.\n\nFloyd said her family is taking a temporary break from fast-food meals and, even though the Getzville restaurant is the closest Burger King to her home, it's off their dining list.\n\n\"We no longer will go there,\" she said.\n\n___\n\n10 popular international fast food chains that are growing in the US 10 popular international fast food chains that are growing in the US Jollibee Pret A Manger Le Pain Quotidien Tim Hortons Pollo Campero Beard Papa's TKK Fried Chicken El Pollo Loco Yashinova Nando's The business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\nSign up!

There's blood all over her food and inside the bag.\"\n\nFloyd on Tuesday said her daughter had taken one bite of her hamburger and had eaten a couple of French fries. There was a red liquid all over her daughter's food and wrappers and, though not to the same degree, on her own order. Floyd said she hadn't consumed any of her meal.\n\nFloyd said she pulled over her vehicle and called the restaurant, where the manager told her a worker had cut his hand.\n\nHe offered to refund the cost of her meal, Floyd recalled. \"I told him, 'No thank you,' \" she said.\n\nShe said she was more concerned about whether she would have to take her daughter to the hospital for blood work as a safety precaution.\n\n\"It's so scary,\" she recalled.\n\nFloyd said she called the Niagara County Health Department, where an employee told her all they could do is take a report, and she contacted her daughter's pediatrician. She said she was trying not to spiral emotionally with her daughter and her newborn in the car with her as she waited for return phone calls.\n\n\"I AM LIVID!!!!\" she concluded in her Facebook post that has been shared 11,000 times.\n\nFloyd said she made the posts and video because she wanted to warn other customers about what had happened, particularly those who had ordered from the restaurant before or after her.\n\n\"It's a busy location,\" she said.\n\nIn a follow-up video posted on TikTok, which received 958,000 likes and 73,000 shares, she showed the camera spots of blood on the packaging and wrappers for her daughter's burger, fries and toy.\n\nFloyd on Monday began speaking to local and national news outlets, including People magazine and the New York Post.\n\n\"We were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident,\" a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have been in contact with the guest and are working with her to resolve this incident.\"\n\nThe company statement said the employee, upon noticing his injury, \"immediately stepped away.\"\n\nBurger King said it closed the restaurant last weekend for worker retraining and to allow an outside company \"to complete a deep cleaning.\"\n\nAll employees were paid for any lost shifts during the shutdown and the restaurant reopened on Monday, the company said.\n\nA spokesperson on Tuesday said the Erie County Health Department did not receive a direct complaint from a member of the public, but followed up with the restaurant after seeing initial news reports.\n\n\"A sanitarian inspected the facility on Monday 7/29,\" spokesperson Kara Kane said in an email. \"No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\"\n\nFloyd said the incident remains troubling to her and her family, and she has cried while tucking her children in at night.\n\n\"I'm obviously trying to stay strong for my daughter, because that's what's needed right now,\" she said. \"But, emotionally, I am not doing OK.\"\n\nShe said she hasn't decided whether to sue Burger King, but is talking to lawyers.\n\n\"My daughter's health is my main priority,\" Floyd said. She said she must wait a month before her daughter can be screened for blood-borne diseases.\n\nFloyd said her family is taking a temporary break from fast-food meals and, even though the Getzville restaurant is the closest Burger King to her home, it's off their dining list.\n\n\"We no longer will go there,\" she said.\n\n___\n\n10 popular international fast food chains that are growing in the

On Friday, Tiffany Floyd drove her 4-year-old through a fast food drive-through and was startled to see their food soaked in crimson liquid. The kid had reportedly insisted on eating the meal without ketchup and Floyd was disappointed for what she thought was a mix-up when she looked into the meal. The mother was horrified to learn that her daughter's fries and burger contained blood instead of what she had assumed to be ketchup.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post, Floyd said, \"All I heard was, 'Mom, I don't want ketchup,' so I grabbed her bag, thinking that they messed up our order again, and I looked and there was just blood all over her hamburger, all over the wrapper. I looked inside the bag, there's blood on her toys, everything.\"\n\nFloyd immediately contacted the establishment, claiming that Dan, the manager, informed her that a chef had wounded his hand and was bleeding.\n\n\"And that he was so sorry, and if I came back, he would refund me,\" she added.\n\nIn addition, Floyd phoned the paediatrician for her daughter, who informed her that she would need to wait 30 days for her child's blood to be examined in order to determine whether or not the child had an infectious disease.\n\nFloyd said to the outlet that her kid wouldn't have to get pricked if they simply had the wounded worker go get tested. The management had refused to reveal to her the identity of the employee.\n\nShe also filed a report with the Niagara County Department of Health through her local health inspector. Floyd told the news outlet that \"he spoke to the same manager, who said, 'I did have somebody cut their finger, but they didn't think they were bleeding that bad.'\"\n\nThe concerned mother then navigated to Burger King's website to get in touch with the firm's corporate headquarters on Friday.

Could it have just been ketchup?\n\nAccidents can happen in the workplace. It might be something small without any consequences, or it could be something incredibly serious that you'd want to address immediately. Was this Burger King meal really spattered with blood or was it just ketchup? It matters!\n\nNew York Mom Claims Daughter's Burger King Meal Was Spattered With Blood\n\nWhen you're working around sharp instruments and tools, cuts can happen. Hopefully, the blood doesn't get onto any of the food or things people are commonly using. Unfortunately, it sounds like that's what happened in this case!\n\nAccording to Daily Mail, a New York mother, Tiffany Floyd, gave her daughter a kids' meal consisting of a burger and fries and ordered the meal without ketchup. However, when they looked at the food they noticed red all over the wrapper and food. Odd because they requested \"no ketchup\" on the order. Well, it wasn't ketchup. The red on her food turned out to actually be blood, per Daily Mail. Floyd tells the outlet, \"I gave her the bag to eat the food and I heard 'Mom I don't want ketchup', so I take the bag back thinking they've messed up our order and I look and see there is blood all over the bag, the hamburger, the toy, her fries, everything. I instantly told her to spit out her food. She did have fries and a bit of her hamburger. And then I looked at my meal, and there was blood on mine too.\" No! That would be a horrible realization that your child just consumed a stranger's blood!\n\nDaily Mail says Floyd called Burger King and the manager said somebody cut his hand and that if she came back she would get a refund. Additionally, she reached out to the local health department and filed a report. Now, the viral video has more than 3 million view but she's not celebrating that. Her daughter now has to get monthly blood tests for an entire year to make sure she didn't pick up any illnesses. That's incredibly inconvenient but you have to do it!\n\nCommenters online continue to tell her she needs to press charges and that there's definitely a lawsuit there. Burger King reportedly offered to pay for any medical expenses but Floyd believes that is not enough, per Daily Mail. The location did temporarily close down for a deep cleaning.

As they traveled through Getszville, New York, a town near Buffalo, she decided to pull in at an area Burger King to get a kid's meal for her daughter and a meal for herself.\n\n\"I went to the drive-thru, I handed my daughter the meal. About five minutes down the road I heard 'mommy I didn't want ketchup.'

I spoke to the manager Dan. He did inform me somebody cut their hand, that he was sorry. And if I wanted to come back with the bag, he would refund me my money. I declined,\" she said.\n\nFloyd reached out the Niagara County Health Department and filed a complaint. She the decided to take it one step further, taking to social media to warn others.\n\n\"Later that night as I calmed down is when I made the TikTok to alert people. If you were at that location at that time that day to maybe check the bags. If you still have the bags or if you really think that this might impact you, maybe call your doctor and get your blood done to check,\" she said.\n\nHer daughter is getting blood test done this week and will have continue to get monthly test for a year to ensure no diseases were transmitted.\n\nMeanwhile, Floyd says her daughter is traumatized and doesn't have an appetite.\n\n\"She does know that there was blood in her food. So even if I go to give her food, she thinks there's blood in all her food,\" Floyd said. \"She did eat a little bit today, but she watched me make her food which she has never done that.\"\n\nThe Burger King restaurant was inspected and officials found no violations.\n\nThe fast food chain apologizing for the incident, saying they closed the location for the weekend to a extra cleaning and training.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.

(WKBW) -- A Sanborn mother witnessed something she never thought would come to fruition: finding blood on her meal order.\n\nThere is a video circulating across social media accounts about a bloody Burger King bag that was almost entirely consumed by a 4-year-old.\n\nThe TikTok video has gained massive attention from millions, across Western New York and beyond.\n\nI headed to the Burger King location in Getzville to hear the story directly from the mom and learn what action is being taken by the fast food chain.\n\nFriday was a normal day for Tiffany Floyd, her newborn and 4-year-old daughter who were running errands.\n\nShe decided to go to Burger King to get a kid's meal for her daughter and a meal for herself.\n\n\"I went through the drive-thru, I handed my daughter the meal. About five minutes down the road, I heard 'Mommy, I didn't want ketchup.' I grabbed the bag back from her thinking they just messed up her meal,\" Tiffany Floyd said.\n\nTo her surprise, it was not ketchup. It was blood.\n\n\"All over the hamburger, the fry, the toy,\" Floyd said.\n\nThat is when the Sanborn mother pulled over immediately, asking her daughter to spit out whatever she had in her mouth.\n\nShe told me her daughter had a couple of French fries.\n\nFloyd said, \"I called Burger King. I spoke to the manager Dan. he did inform me that somebody cut their hand right before they cooked and bagged my food, that he was sorry and that if I wanted to come back with a bag he would refund me my money. I declined. I said 'No thank you.'\"\n\nBecause Floyd lives in Niagara County, she contacted the Niagara County Health Department and filed a complaint.\n\nShe explained, \"Later that night, as I calmed down, is when I made the TikTok to alert people. If you were at that location at that time that day to maybe check the bags if you still have the bags or if you really think that this might impact you, maybe call your doctor and get your blood done to check.\"\n\nFloyd told me her daughter is getting a blood test Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Floyd, her daughter's pediatrician will not test her until 30 days have passed because that is when they will truly know whether something had been transmitted. This means, the blood test that will be taken on Tuesday will be a blood line test that doctors can compare with the test 30 days from now.\n\nThe four-year-old will need to have a blood test every month for an entire year, to ensure nothing was transmitted.\n\nUntil then, however, Floyd said her daughter is traumatized by the situation and has not eaten much all weekend.\n\nShe said, \"I'm not trying to talk a lot to her about it because she is only four but she does know that there was blood in her food. So, even if I go to give her food, she thinks there's blood in all her food. She did eat a little bit today but she watched me make her food which she has never done that.\"\n\nThe Niagara County Public Health Department forwarded the complaint to Erie County since that is where the Burger King is located.\n\nI reached out to Erie County and received this statement Monday:\n\nThough we did not receive a complaint from the public regarding this incident, based on news reports our sanitarians did log a complaint and a sanitarian inspected the facility today 7/29. No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\n\nOur public health sanitarians follow up on all health and safety complaints received about food facilities in Erie County. Summaries of complaint-based and routine inspections are available online within a few days of an inspection at https://www.healthspace.com/erieny [secure-web.cisco.com].\n\nOur environmental health division handles complaints for food facilities in Erie County. Call 716-961-6800 or use our online form [secure-web.cisco.com].\n\nOur department investigates reports of food-related illness - call (716) 858-7697. Symptoms of food-related illness can include vomiting/nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Anyone with a concern about their personal health should contact their doctor or other qualified medical professional.\n\n-- Erie County Department of Health (ECDOH) Spokesperson\n\n\"Though we did not receive a complaint from the public regarding this incident, based on news reports our sanitarians did log a complaint and a sanitarian inspected the facility today 7/29. No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\"\n\nI also reached out to Burger King's PR team and received this statement saying they are \"deeply upset\" by the incident:\n\nWe were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident. We have been in contact with the Guest and are working with her to resolve this incident. This incident was the result of a team member in the restaurant who injured his finger, and upon noticing immediately stepped away. We closed the restaurant over the weekend to retrain all the team members and hired an external company to complete a deep cleaning. We expect the restaurant to re-open Monday, July 29, and are fully paying team members for any lost shifts during this temporary shut down.\n\n-- BK PR Team\n\nThe Burger King location at Millersport HWY opened around 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nAnyone who has a problem with their food can reach out to Erie County Environmental Health Division, which handles complaints for food facilities, at (716) 961-6800 or Niagara County at (716) 439-7579.\n\nAdditionally, the New York State Department of Health Bureau of Emergency Medical Services has guidelines for potential blood exposures.

(WIVB) - A New York woman said she is considering legal action after her 4-year-old daughter found blood splattered on her Burger King meal.\n\nTiffany Floyd told Nexstar's WIVB that she stopped at a Burger King in Getzville, roughly 16 miles north of Buffalo, around noon on Friday, July 26.\n\nAbout five minutes after leaving the drive-thru, Floyd said her young daughter opened the bag and complained about ketchup being on her burger. That's when Floyd turned around and saw blood on the burger and its wrapper, she said.\n\n\"Someone has to be accounted for this because this is not OK,\" Floyd said.\n\nThe Burger King is located in Erie County, but Floyd initially called her local health department in Niagara County. A Niagara County sanitarian then called the manager of the fast-food restaurant to investigate, according to a preliminary report obtained by WIVB.\n\nThe manager reportedly told the sanitarian that an employee, while wearing gloves, pinched his finger in the microwave door and didn't realize he was bleeding so badly.\n\nFloyd said her daughter was traumatized by the experience and has barely eaten anything since, fearing blood could be in her food.\n\n\"Either they did not follow the proper steps after getting cut or anything, but this cannot happen again. You know, for my 4-year-old to experience this, it's terrible,\" Floyd said.\n\nIn a statement, Burger King said the incident was the result of a team member who injured his finger and immediately stepped away.\n\nThe fast-food giant added that the Burger King location was closed over the weekend to re-train all employees and deep clean the restaurant.\n\nThe company's full statement reads: \"We were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident.

Here's the real reason you don't want bloody food", "body": "The kids menus at fast food restaurants across the U.S. are all fairly predictable, featuring quick-eat portions of popular staples. Burgers, chicken nuggets, fries, some fruit offering lots of times. They're intended to be easy so parents know they can give their kiddos something in the minivan while running errands.\n\nA look at the Burger King kids menu shows it to be as straight down the middle ordinary as can be, which is why a western New York mother was especially disturbed to see that the BK restaurant she visited recently with her daughter included a new unexpected add-on... Blood.\n\nIn a TikTok clip that has been viewed close to 3 million times, Tiffany Floyd shares the details of her visit to a Burger King in Getzville, New York.\n\n\"I decided to get a happy meal for my daughter... Gave her the bag because obviously I'm a busy mom. I just gave her the bag to eat the food. And I heard, 'Mom, I don't want ketchup.'\"\n\nCue the dramatic film score strings of dread as Floyd takes the bag. She discovers dark red blood splatters on the burger wrapper, bag itself, french fries. Even the kids toy included in the meal.\n\n\"So I called Burger King because I was not going to go back there. And the manager had told me that somebody did cut his hand. And that if I came back, he would give me a refund of my money.\"\n\nWell, that's certainly a relief and a gesture that clears everything up. For those keeping tabs on the cost of alleviating the stress and anguish of having your child exposed to bodily fluids, Floyd discovered that about $7 is what you can expect these days.\n\nFloyd goes on to note that she'd filed a report of the incident with her local health department, and now has to count down until a month has passed to get her daughter tested for any blood-related issues.\n\nAnd for those who are curious, here's a partial list of diseases that can transmit via exposure to blood:\n\nThe unfortunate incident captured lots of attention, with the New York Post interviewing Floyd and learning more details about the incident, including that her own food also had blood on it.\n\nComments on the post remain outraged over the incident, with many praising Floyd for how calm and restrained she appeared while telling her story.\n\nOne advised seeking a legal remedy: \"Contact an attorney - minimally they'll get you a settlement to offset any medical testing costs etc. (also emotional distress) don't engage with Burger King further, attorney first.\"\n\nAnother shared the diligence Floyd may need to employ to make sure her daughter is healthy.\n\n\"Hi. Cop wife here. My husband was exposed to blood and was sent to the ER for bloodwork then had to go back every month to get tested. Suppose to do that for months possibly a year from what the workplace doctor told us. I would take her to the Hospital for bloodwork cause they HAVE to test her. Also it can take a little bit for anything to show up if she does end up with anything. Hope everything turns out good!\"\n\nAnd another, who claimed to be a former fast food worker, shared their horror story.\n\n\"I also hurt my hand one time but I was a cashier and my manager wouldn't let me go get a Band-Aid because we had a long line so I wrapped my finger with paper towel and hand to use one hand.\"\n\nThe Daily Dot reached out to Burger King via email, and Floyd via direct message.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chad_swiatecki@dailydot.com", "name": "Chad Swiatecki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Burger King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pink Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "French fries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food_restaurant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast-food restaurant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Darwish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Darwish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_nugget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken nugget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minivan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expansion pack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getzville,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Getzville, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Getzville, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Body fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketchup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Dot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Dot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Band-Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ER_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ER (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/07/burger-king-cut.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9769796", "eventUri": "eng-9769796", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

There's blood all over her food and inside the bag.\"\n\nFloyd on Tuesday said her daughter had taken one bite of her hamburger and had eaten a couple of French fries. There was a red liquid all over her daughter's food and wrappers and, though not to the same degree, on her own order. Floyd said she hadn't consumed any of her meal.\n\nFloyd said she pulled over her vehicle and called the restaurant, where the manager told her a worker had cut his hand.\n\nHe offered to refund the cost of her meal, Floyd recalled. \"I told him, 'No thank you,' \" she said.\n\nShe said she was more concerned about whether she would have to take her daughter to the hospital for blood work as a safety precaution.\n\n\"It's so scary,\" she recalled.\n\nFloyd said she called the Niagara County Health Department, where an employee told her all they could do is take a report, and she contacted her daughter's pediatrician. She said she was trying not to spiral emotionally with her daughter and her newborn in the car with her as she waited for return phone calls.\n\n\"I AM LIVID!!!!\" she concluded in her Facebook post that has been shared 11,000 times.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFloyd said she made the posts and video because she wanted to warn other customers about what had happened, particularly those who had ordered from the restaurant before or after her.\n\n\"It's a busy location,\" she said.\n\nIn a follow-up video posted on TikTok, which received 958,000 likes and 73,000 shares, she showed the camera spots of blood on the packaging and wrappers for her daughter's burger, fries and toy.\n\nFloyd on Monday began speaking to local and national news outlets, including People magazine and the New York Post.\n\n\"We were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident,\" a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have been in contact with the guest and are working with her to resolve this incident.\"\n\nThe company statement said the employee, upon noticing his injury, \"immediately stepped away.\"\n\nBurger King said it closed the restaurant last weekend for worker retraining and to allow an outside company \"to complete a deep cleaning.\"\n\nAll employees were paid for any lost shifts during the shutdown and the restaurant reopened on Monday, the company said.\n\nA spokesperson on Tuesday said the Erie County Health Department did not receive a direct complaint from a member of the public, but followed up with the restaurant after seeing initial news reports.\n\n\"A sanitarian inspected the facility on Monday 7/29,\" spokesperson Kara Kane said in an email. \"No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\"\n\nFloyd said the incident remains troubling to her and her family, and she has cried while tucking her children in at night.\n\n\"I'm obviously trying to stay strong for my daughter, because that's what's needed right now,\" she said. \"But, emotionally, I am not doing OK.\"\n\nShe said she hasn't decided whether to sue Burger King, but is talking to lawyers.\n\n\"My daughter's health is my main priority,\" Floyd said. She said she must wait a month before her daughter can be screened for blood-borne diseases.\n\nFloyd said her family is taking a temporary break from fast-food meals and, even though the Getzville restaurant is the closest Burger King to her home, it's off their dining list.\n\n\"We no longer will go there,\" she said.\n\n___\n\n10 popular international fast food chains that are growing in the

Napa officials, nonprofits seem cautious\n\nFloyd made her initial Facebook post at about noon Friday.\n\nShe said in an interview that her daughter, Matayla, had wanted a children's meal, so they ordered through the restaurant's drive-thru.\n\n\"i usually take her food out for her but today i just gave her the bag than i hear 'mommy there's ketchup and i didn't want ketchup,'\" she wrote. \"so i take it back to see if they messed up our order and its BLOOD!!! There's blood all over her food and inside the bag.\"\n\nFloyd on Tuesday said her daughter had taken one bite of her hamburger and had eaten a couple of French fries. There was a red liquid all over her daughter's food and wrappers and, though not to the same degree, on her own order. Floyd said she hadn't consumed any of her meal.\n\nFloyd said she pulled over her vehicle and called the restaurant, where the manager told her a worker had cut his hand.\n\nHe offered to refund the cost of her meal, Floyd recalled. \"I told him, 'No thank you,' \" she said.\n\nShe said she was more concerned about whether she would have to take her daughter to the hospital for blood work as a safety precaution.\n\n\"It's so scary,\" she recalled.\n\nFloyd said she called the Niagara County Health Department, where an employee told her all they could do is take a report, and she contacted her daughter's pediatrician. She said she was trying not to spiral emotionally with her daughter and her newborn in the car with her as she waited for return phone calls.\n\n\"I AM LIVID!!!!\" she concluded in her Facebook post that has been shared 11,000 times.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFloyd said she made the posts and video because she wanted to warn other customers about what had happened, particularly those who had ordered from the restaurant before or after her.\n\n\"It's a busy location,\" she said.\n\nIn a follow-up video posted on TikTok, which received 958,000 likes and 73,000 shares, she showed the camera spots of blood on the packaging and wrappers for her daughter's burger, fries and toy.\n\nFloyd on Monday began speaking to local and national news outlets, including People magazine and the New York Post.\n\n\"We were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident,\" a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement. \"We have been in contact with the guest and are working with her to resolve this incident.\"\n\nThe company statement said the employee, upon noticing his injury, \"immediately stepped away.\"\n\nBurger King said it closed the restaurant last weekend for worker retraining and to allow an outside company \"to complete a deep cleaning.\"\n\nAll employees were paid for any lost shifts during the shutdown and the restaurant reopened on Monday, the company said.\n\nA spokesperson on Tuesday said the Erie County Health Department did not receive a direct complaint from a member of the public, but followed up with the restaurant after seeing initial news reports.\n\n\"A sanitarian inspected the facility on Monday 7/29,\" spokesperson Kara Kane said in an email. \"No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\"\n\nFloyd said the incident remains troubling to her and her family, and she has cried while tucking her children in at night.\n\n\"I'm obviously trying to stay strong for my daughter, because that's what's needed right now,\" she said. \"But, emotionally, I am not doing OK.\"\n\nShe said she hasn't decided whether to sue Burger King, but is talking to lawyers.\n\n\"My daughter's health is my main priority,\" Floyd said. She said she must wait a month before her daughter can be screened for blood-borne diseases.\n\nFloyd said her family is taking a temporary break from fast-food meals and, even though the Getzville restaurant is the closest Burger King to her home, it's off their dining list.\n\n\"We no longer will go there,\" she said.\n\n___\n\n10 popular international fast food chains that are growing in the

However, a simple dining experience turned into a horrific incident for a New York mom Tiffany Floyd, and her four-year-old daughter, Tay. The mom ordered a meal for herself and one for her daughter from a Burger King outlet in Getzville, New York, on July 26, 2024, reported the New York Post. It was after the child had eaten some fries and a bit of her hamburger that the mom discovered her daughter's food was covered in blood. Floyd recounted the entire incident in a clip posted to TikTok.\n\n\"I gave her the bag to eat the food and I heard 'Mom I don't want ketchup', so I take the bag back thinking they'd messed up our order and I looked and saw there was blood all over her bag, the hamburger, the toy, her fries, everything,\" Daily Mail quoted Floyd saying. \"I instantly told her to spit out her food. She did have fries and a bit of her hamburger. And then I looked at my meal, and there was blood on mine too.\"\n\nFloyd contacted the restaurant and was told that a team member had cut his hand earlier in the restaurant.\n\n\"I called Burger King and the manager told me that somebody cut his hand and that if I came back he would give me a refund. I reached out to our local health department and they filed a report but there's not much more they can do,\" the mom revealed.\n\nAlso Read: Watch: Vlogger Finds Dead Fly In Burger King Taco; Fast-Food Chain Responds\n\nBurger King's corporate office has offered to pay for any medical expenses incurred by the family following the incident.

Burger King released the following statement:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'We were deeply upset and concerned. We have been in contact with the Guest and are working with her to resolve this incident.

We closed the restaurant to retrain all the team members and hired an external company to complete a deep cleaning,' the company explained. We expect the restaurant to re-open Monday and are fully paying team members for any lost shifts during this temporary shut down.'\n\nAlso Read: Viral: Man Finds Tiny White Worms In Amul Protein Buttermilk Carton, Company Responds\n\nAdvertisement\n\nComments\n\nAbout Jigyasa KakwaniJigyasa finds her solace through writing, a medium she is exploring to make the world more informed and curious with every story published.

She said she must wait a month before her daughter can be screened for blood-borne diseases.\n\nFloyd said her family is taking a temporary break from fast-food meals and, even though the Getzville

(Scripps News Buffalo)\n\nA New York mother went through a Burger King drive-thru hoping to get a quick bite for herself and her daughter, but what she left with was anything but an edible meal.\n\nTiffany Floyd and her 4-year-old daughter had been running errands on Friday before they decided to stop by a Burger King in Getzville, about 16 miles from Buffalo.\n\n\"I went through the drive-thru. I handed my daughter the meal. About five minutes down the road, I heard 'Mommy, I didn't want ketchup.' I grabbed the bag back from her thinking they just messed up her meal,\" Floyd said.\n\nTo her surprise, the red liquid \"all over\" her daughter's hamburger, french fries and kids' meal toy was not ketchup; it was blood.\n\nFloyd told Scripps News Buffalo she pulled over immediately and asked her daughter to spit out whatever she had in her mouth. At that point, her daughter had already eaten a couple of french fries.\n\nThe mom then called the Burger King on Millersport Highway and spoke to the manager, identified as Dan.\n\n\"He did inform me that somebody cut their hand right before they cooked and bagged my food, that he was sorry and that if I wanted to come back with a bag he would refund me my money,\" Floyd said. \"I declined. I said 'No thank you.'\"\n\nFloyd next contacted the Niagara County Department of Health and filed a complaint. Niagara County forwarded the complaint to the Erie County Department of Health due to the location of the Burger King.\n\nLater that night, Floyd posted a TikTok video, which has now gone viral, of the bloody wrapper in order to \"alert people,\" she told Scripps News Buffalo.\n\n\"If you were at that location at that time that day, to maybe check the bags if you still have the bags, or if you really think that this might impact you, maybe call your doctor and get your blood done to check,\" Floyd said.\n\nFloyd said her daughter is traumatized by the situation and has not eaten much since.\n\n\"I'm not trying to talk a lot to her about it because she is only 4, but she does know that there was blood in her food,\" Floyd told Scripps News Buffalo. \"Even if I go to give her food, she thinks there's blood in all her food. She did eat a little bit today but she watched me make her food which she has never done that.\"\n\nAccording to Floyd, her daughter is getting a blood test on Tuesday. Her pediatrician will not test her until 30 days have passed because she said that's when they will truly know whether something has been transmitted. This means the blood test that will be taken on Tuesday will be a bloodline test that doctors can compare with the test 30 days from now. She will need to have a blood test every month for an entire year to ensure nothing was transmitted.\n\nScripps News Buffalo reached out to the Erie County Department of Health and received this statement on Monday:\n\n\"Though we did not receive a complaint from the public regarding this incident, based on news reports our sanitarians did log a complaint and a sanitarian inspected the facility today 7/29. No critical or non-critical violations were found at the time of inspection.\n\nOur public health sanitarians follow up on all health and safety complaints received about food facilities in Erie County. Summaries of complaint-based and routine inspections are available online within a few days of an inspection at https://www.healthspace.com/erieny [secure-web.cisco.com].\n\nOur environmental health division handles complaints for food facilities in Erie County. Call 716-961-6800 or use our online form [secure-web.cisco.com].\n\nOur department investigates reports of food-related illness - call (716) 858-7697. Symptoms of food-related illness can include vomiting/nausea, abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Anyone with a concern about their personal health should contact their doctor or other qualified medical professional.\"\n\nScripps News Buffalo also reached out to Burger King and received the statement below:\n\n\"We were deeply upset and concerned to learn of this incident. We have been in contact with the Guest and are working with her to resolve this incident. This incident was the result of a team member in the restaurant who injured his finger, and upon noticing immediately stepped away.

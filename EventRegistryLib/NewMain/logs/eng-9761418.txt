There was something entirely different about Big Ten football media days this year.\n\nThe conference officially expands to 18 teams with the addition of Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington on Aug. 2, and this week's media gathering at Lucas Oil Stadium is serving as an introduction of the Ducks, Bruins, Trojans and Huskies to their new conference brethren.\n\nThe Big Ten and the SEC, which poached Oklahoma and Texas from the Big 12, give college football two super conferences and others trying to keep up with varying degrees of success. With the four former Pac-12 teams in the Big Ten fold, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule on Wednesday staked a claim for his league.\n\n\"This is the NFL of college football,\" he said of the Big Ten.\n\nWednesday's second day of media appearances featured newcomers USC and UCLA. Oregon and Washington get their podium time Thursday, the same day Gophers coach P.J. Fleck brings quarterback Max Brosmer, running back Darius Taylor and linebacker Cody Lindenberg to the event.\n\nPlayers both steeped in the conference's traditions and new to rivalries spoke about how seeing fresh faces and competing in new venues will provide a spark. Strong opinions from those on the Big Ten side posited these suntanned Californians with their fancy passing games won't be able to match the physicality and grit from the mostly Midwestern conference.\n\nPenn State defensive lineman Dvon J-Thomas looks forward to seeing how the former Pac-12 teams will do when the gales of November come early. \"They're gonna feel this cold,\" J-Thomas said. \"They're out there in sunny California, and they're gonna feel this East Coast cold.\"\n\nNittany Lions teammate Jaylen Reed, a versatile defensive back, expects to see footballs flying from the quartet of newcomers this season.\n\n\"Their style of play is different than the [rest of the] Big Ten,\" said Reed, whose Nittany Lions host UCLA on Oct. 5 before facing USC at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum seven days later. \"We're going to have to get adjusted to their style of play, and they're going to have to adjust to our style of play.\"\n\nAsked if there was anything he was looking forward to when meeting the Trojans and Bruins, Reed said with a smile, \"It brings me more opportunities to get interceptions.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nUSC quarterback Miller Moss, who passed for 372 yards and six touchdowns in his first career start, a Holiday Bowl win over Louisville in 2023, tried to be diplomatic when refuting those who doubt the former Pac-12 teams.\n\n\"Uh, hmm,\" Miller said, laughing after a long pause. \"I'm trying to follow my media training. ... Obviously, as you go throughout the country, people play different brands of football geographically. That's in large part attributed to the type of player that comes from a geographic area. To now have the crossover between the two will be interesting and provide for more exciting matchups.\"\n\nMiller had a prediction, too: \"We'll introduce some intricacies in game plans that maybe they haven't seen before.\"\n\nTrojans coach Lincoln Riley said he's tweaked his recruiting with the Big Ten move in mind, and USC offensive tackle Jonah Monheim acknowledges the Trojans are trying to put on muscle.\n\n\"Looking at where we were last year and where we need to be in the Big Ten, on the 'O' line there's been a big emphasis on gaining weight and strength,\" the 6-5, 305-pounder said.\n\nHowever, he's not buying the \"soft\" label that some apply to the ex-Pac-12 quartet.\n\n\"That's just the SoCal, L.A. stereotype,\" Monheim said, adding, \"It's wrong because at the end of the day, we all have to play the same game on the same field.\"\n\nJay Toia, a defensive lineman for UCLA, concurred with Monheim.\n\n\"The model of the Big Ten is physicality, but I don't think that's new for us,\" Toia said. \"We had a powerhouse like Utah [in the Pac-12], and we played Oregon State, which is a big, physical run team. I don't think that's anything we can't handle.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Tyler Warren played peacemaker in the end. \"There were some great teams that got added to our conference,\" he said. \"It can only bring up the level our conference and the type of football we play.\"\n\n____\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

The USC Trojans, Washington Huskies, Oregon Ducks, UCLA Bruins, Arizona Wildcats, Arizona State Sun Devils, Colorado Buffaloes, Utah Utes, Stanford Cardinal, and California Golden Bears are all in new conferences.\n\nJoel Klatt recently appeared on The Herd with Colin Cowherd to discuss the upcoming season. He even predicted that USC would be a \"sleeper\" in 2024.\n\n\"I think USC could be a sleeper team. I think it all hinges on that game against LSU, to be honest, in Vegas,\" Klatt said. \"That game is so important for Lincoln Riley because now it seems like with the USC faithful that there's a bit of a wait-and-see. Let's wait and see how he's going to do without Caleb Williams.\"\n\nThe Trojans lost star quarterback Caleb Williams to the NFL Draft. He was the No. 1 overall pick by the Chicago Bears.\n\nUSC brought in former UNLV Rebels QB Jayden Maiava through the transfer portal. The Trojans also have Holiday Bowl standout Miller Moss on the roster. Moss had 372 passing yards and six touchdowns in that game.\n\nOne of the biggest problems that USC faced last season was its defense. After firing Alex Grinch last year, USC brought in former UCLA defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn. Under Lynn at UCLA, the Bruins had top-five Pac-12 rankings in points allowed, passing yards allowed, rushing yards allowed, and total yards allowed per game.\n\nStars like Zachariah Branch, Bear Alexander, and Jamil Muhammad are also returning to USC.\n\nThe Trojans face the LSU Tigers to kick off the 2024 season.\n\nRelated: David Pollack Names 'Perfect Team' To Join Big Ten In Conference Realignment", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_bricker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Bricker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klatt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Klatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_State_Cougars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington State Cougars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Utes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah Utes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Herd_with_Colin_Cowherd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Herd with Colin Cowherd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Buffaloes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Buffaloes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Golden_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Golden Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanford Cardinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grinch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Grinch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pollack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Pollack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNLV_Rebels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNLV Rebels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holiday Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761418", "eventUri": "eng-9761418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Last season, Washington and Oregon fought each other for the Pac-12 title in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, there was another new face in the Big Ten that Greg McElroy discussed on the latest edition of Always College Football. He focused on USC and how they could play the spoiler role in 2024.\n\nThis season, the Trojans will have new faces on both sides of the ball. Alex Grinch is gone, and former UCLA defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn is now in the role. Caleb Williams is now in the NFL as well.\n\n\"...I still think USC has a chance down the road to be better it just won't be this year. They're gonna play the spoiler this year,\" McElroy said. \"They're gonna create some problems for folks. They're probably gonna be able to score more than anybody, but I have questions about them holding up along both lines of scrimmage.\"\n\nUnder Lynn, the Bruins allowed 18.4 points per game last season, the second-fewest in the Pac-12. They were also second in the conference in turnovers forced per game with 1.8.\n\nThe USC quarterback room includes Miller Moss, former UNLV Rebels star Jayden Maiava, Jake Jensen, and Gage Roy. Moss and Maiava are the players expected to compete for the starting job. Moss was a former four-star recruit in the 2022 class, per the On3 Industry Rankings.\n\nMaiava has the most experience out of the group. Maiava played in 14 games for UNLV last season with 3,085 passing yards, 17 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.\n\nMoss did not seem much at USC last season until the bowl game at the end of the season. Moss had an explosive outing with 372 passing yards and six touchdowns.\n\nUSC also returns stars like Zachariah Branch. The Trojans added former Mississippi State Bulldogs running back Jo'quavious Marks, former UCLA safety Kamari Ramsey, and former UCLA receiver John Humphrey, among others.\n\nThe spoiler role might suit USC nicely in 2024.\n\nRelated: Greg McElroy Makes Surprising Pick For College Football Playoff Contender", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_bricker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Bricker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grinch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Grinch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_McElroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg McElroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNLV_Rebels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UNLV Rebels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Nevada,_Las_Vegas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Nevada, Las Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761418", "eventUri": "eng-9761418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

There was something entirely different about Big Ten football media days this year.\n\nThe conference officially expands to 18 teams with the addition of Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington on Aug. 2, and this week's media gathering at Lucas Oil Stadium is serving as an introduction of the Ducks, Bruins, Trojans and Huskies to their new conference brethren.\n\nThe Big Ten and the SEC, which poached Oklahoma and Texas from the Big 12, give college football two super conferences and others trying to keep up with varying degrees of success. With the four former Pac-12 teams in the Big Ten fold, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule on Wednesday staked a claim for his league.\n\n\"This is the NFL of college football,\" he said of the Big Ten.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Oregon and Washington get their podium time Thursday, the same day Gophers coach P.J. Fleck brings quarterback Max Brosmer, running back Darius Taylor and linebacker Cody Lindenberg to the event.\n\nPlayers both steeped in the conference's traditions and new to rivalries spoke about how seeing fresh faces and competing in new venues will provide a spark. Strong opinions from those on the Big Ten side posited these suntanned Californians with their fancy passing games won't be able to match the physicality and grit from the mostly Midwestern conference.\n\nPenn State defensive lineman Dvon J-Thomas looks forward to seeing how the former Pac-12 teams will do when the gales of November come early. \"They're gonna feel this cold,\" J-Thomas said. \"They're out there in sunny California, and they're gonna feel this East Coast cold.\"\n\nNittany Lions teammate Jaylen Reed, a versatile defensive back, expects to see footballs flying from the quartet of newcomers this season.\n\n\"Their style of play is different than the [rest of the] Big Ten,\" said Reed, whose Nittany Lions host UCLA on Oct. 5 before facing USC at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum seven days later. \"We're going to have to get adjusted to their style of play, and they're going to have to adjust to our style of play.\"\n\nAsked if there was anything he was looking forward to when meeting the Trojans and Bruins, Reed said with a smile, \"It brings me more opportunities to get interceptions.\"\n\nUSC quarterback Miller Moss, who passed for 372 yards and six touchdowns in his first career start, a Holiday Bowl win over Louisville in 2023, tried to be diplomatic when refuting those who doubt the former Pac-12 teams.\n\n\"Uh, hmm,\" Miller said, laughing after a long pause. \"I'm trying to follow my media training. ... Obviously, as you go throughout the country, people play different brands of football geographically. That's in large part attributed to the type of player that comes from a geographic area. To now have the crossover between the two will be interesting and provide for more exciting matchups.\"\n\nMiller had a prediction, too: \"We'll introduce some intricacies in game plans that maybe they haven't seen before.\"\n\nTrojans coach Lincoln Riley said he's tweaked his recruiting with the Big Ten move in mind, and USC offensive tackle Jonah Monheim acknowledges the Trojans are trying to put on muscle.\n\n\"Looking at where we were last year and where we need to be in the Big Ten, on the 'O' line there's been a big emphasis on gaining weight and strength,\" the 6-5, 305-pounder said.\n\nHowever, he's not buying the \"soft\" label that some apply to the ex-Pac-12 quartet.\n\n\"That's just the SoCal, L.A. stereotype,\" Monheim said, adding, \"It's wrong because at the end of the day, we all have to play the same game on the same field.\"\n\nJay Toia, a defensive lineman for UCLA, concurred with Monheim.\n\n\"The model of the Big Ten is physicality, but I don't think that's new for us,\" Toia said. \"We had a powerhouse like Utah [in the Pac-12], and we played Oregon State, which is a big, physical run team. I don't think that's anything we can't handle.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Tyler Warren played peacemaker in the end. \"There were some great teams that got added to our conference,\" he said. \"It can only bring up the level our conference and the type of football we play.\"\n\n____\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Ramsey's physical tools and his familiarity with Lynn's defense make him an ideal candidate to play center field in this offense. It will be tough to fill the void left by three year free safety Calen Bullock on the field, but his experience last year with Lynn at UCLA will make him a coach on the field, flattening the learning curve for the Trojan defense in 2024.\n\nPerceptions of this 2024 Trojan team vary.

Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray won the award in consecutive seasons.\n\nThe man who coached those players at Oklahoma was Lincoln Riley. After his stint at Oklahoma, Riley headed to California to coach the USC Trojans. He coached Caleb Williams, who won the award in 2022.\n\nWhile there are fans of Riley, Paul Finebaum is not one of them. Finebaum appeared on SportsCenter recently to talk about his problems with the head coach. Finebaum even called Riley a \"hot mess.\"\n\n\"...Last season was a hot mess at the end, that this team crashed and burned with the best player in college football,\" Finebaum said. \"I don't like the future. He went out and got another defensive coordinator from across the street, but it's still the same old problem for Lincoln Riley. He only knows one side of the ball, and I think that's gonna keep them out of the playoffs.\"\n\nLast season was a disaster for USC in all respects. Williams's production dropped compared to his Heisman-winning season in 2022. The USC quarterback had 3,633 passing yards and 30 touchdowns, compared to 4,537 passing yards and 42 touchdowns a year prior.\n\nHowever, the blame should not all be on Williams. USC got off to a 6-0 start before going 1-5 in its final six regular-season games.\n\nThe defense was one of the worst in the Pac-12 as well. The Trojans allowed the most rushing yards (186.5) and third-most offensive yards per game (432.8)\n\nTo help remedy the defense, USC hired former UCLA Bruins defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn. Under Lynn last season, UCLA was in the top five points allowed per game (18.4), opponent turnovers per game (1.8), and passing yards allowed per game (220.8). UCLA also led the conference in rushing yards allowed per game (80.8) and total yards allowed per game (301.5).\n\nUSC opens the year with the LSU Tigers on Sept. 1.\n\nRelated: Joel Klatt Announces Major College Football Program As Sleeper For 2024", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grant_bricker@postandcourier.com", "name": "Grant Bricker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyler_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyler Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Klatt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joel Klatt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761418", "eventUri": "eng-9761418", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 1895, "textEnd": 1902}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

However, the optimism is remarkably high with a new defensive coordinator, D'Anton Lynn, and some key transfers they acquired, like safety Kamari Ramsey.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ramsey appeared at Big Ten media day and discussed what to expect from the new-look Trojans defense.\n\n\"We're gonna play fast, we're gonna play physical and we're gonna play assignment football. We're gonna play sound with our technique and we're gonna pay attention to the little details,\" Ramsey said, per On3's Scott Schrader.\n\nUSC was none of those things last season or the season prior.

For that to happen, the team's defense will have to take a marked step forward.\n\nTo that end, Riley hired a new defensive coordinator in D'Anton Lynn, as well as a couple other new assistant coaches.\n\nAlready, those going against the defense can see the difference.\n\n\"I would say it's night and day when it comes to this year and last year,\" quarterback Miller Moss said. \"I think going against obviously guys like Kamari (Ramsey), Easton (Mascarenas-Arnold) who came in, Mason Cobb, along with a lot of really special players in the secondary makes it difficult for me as a quarterback. But it also makes me better.\"\n\nJust how bad were things last season? USC finished 119th in total defense and 121st in scoring defense, ranked among the bottom 15 teams nationally. In many ways, USC wasted the Heisman Trophy caliber career of quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nLincoln Riley is even facing some minor heat on his job after the team finished with five losses in 2023.\n\nIf you listen to Moss, though, things certainly seem like they're on the upswing on the defensive side of the ball. And that could mean USC takes a significant step forward this fall.\n\n\"I think you can kind of see coach Lynn's NFL pedigree in going against him in that he forces me to continue to be in the right spots every single time,\" Moss said. \"And if I try to gamble or do something unnecessary, try to take chances that aren't necessarily there he always makes me pay. So he definitely makes me better as a quarterback and as a player and that's something that I really value in practice and helps me get the most out of my practice time. So I'm very grateful to them, but also really, really excited to see what they do this year.\"\n\nFrom the defensive perspective, safety Kamari Ramsey, a UCLA transfer, shared what he has seen from the new-look unit under Lynn.\n\n\"Very aggressive. He doesn't let the offense dictate what we do, he dictates what the offense wants to do,\" Ramsey said. \"So I just like how aggressive he is, not playing soft, just being aggressive and blitzing. He always has the right gameplan and he's a great coach.\"\n\nUSC fans will get a first look at Lynn's new defense come Sept. 1, when the team takes on LSU in the season opener.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_goldkamp@on3.com", "name": "Thomas Goldkamp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lincoln Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Anton_Lynn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D'Anton Lynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Easton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/30172951/Untitled-design-85.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761418", "eventUri": "eng-9761418", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-01", "textStart": 2291, "textEnd": 2298}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Obviously, as you go throughout the country, people play different brands of football geographically. That's in large part attributed to the type of player that comes from a geographic area. To now have the crossover between the two will be interesting and provide for more exciting matchups.\"\n\nMiller had a prediction, too: \"We'll introduce some intricacies in game plans that maybe they haven't seen before.\"\n\nTrojans coach Lincoln Riley said he's tweaked his recruiting with the Big Ten move in mind, and USC offensive tackle Jonah Monheim acknowledges the Trojans are trying to put on muscle.\n\n\"Looking at where we were last year and where we need to be in the Big Ten, on the 'O' line there's been a big emphasis on gaining weight and strength,\" the 6-5, 305-pounder said.\n\nHowever, he's not buying the \"soft\" label that some apply to the ex-Pac-12 quartet.\n\n\"That's just the SoCal, L.A. stereotype,\" Monheim said, adding, \"It's wrong because at the end of the day, we all have to play the same game on the same field.\"\n\nJay Toia, a defensive lineman for UCLA, concurred with Monheim.\n\n\"The model of the Big Ten is physicality, but I don't think that's new for us,\" Toia said. \"We had a powerhouse like Utah [in the Pac-12], and we played Oregon State, which is a big, physical run team. I don't think that's anything we can't handle.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Tyler Warren played peacemaker in the end. \"There were some great teams that got added to our conference,\" he said. \"It can only bring up the level our conference and the type of football we play.\"\n\n____\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Ramsey really likes what he sees from two of the USC players he has had to compete against in practice: Ja'Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon. Ramsey told Morrissette that those two receivers are being \"slept on\" in a larger context.\n\nLane and Lemon certainly made their presences felt in the Holiday Bowl against Louisville. It was just one game, and yet USC saw what the future could bring in Lincoln Riley's offense. Lane and Lemon catching passes from Miller Moss could enable USC's passing attack to produce a big season and ensure that the offense will maintain a very high standard one year after the departure of Caleb Williams.

Taomi played on the defensive line and at offensive tackle at Hancock College for one season after graduating from St. Joseph in the spring of 2023. Taomi said he will play strictly on offense at USC.\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 355 pounds, \"Erwin has the size to play Division 1 football,\" said St. Joseph football coach Pepe Villasenor. Villasenor coached Taomi when Taomi played for St. Joseph.\n\nTaomi will join former St. Joseph teammate Collin Fasse in the Trojans football program. Fasse, a wide receiver, will be a preferred walk-on at USC.\n\nWhen it comes to academics and athletics, the ceiling doesn't get much higher than USC as far as Taomi is concerned, and as far as four-year schools, \"USC was always my No. 1 choice,\" Taomi said shortly after thanking the dozens of supporters who showed up for the signing.\n\n\"More than his size, Erwin's maturity will allow him to adapt quickly,\" to USC football, said Villasenor.\n\nTaomi won't have much time to revel in landing at USC, late of the disbanded Pac-12 conference, soon to be a Big 10 member and possessor of a proud football heritage.\n\n\"I'll report to USC sometime this weekend,\" said Taomi.\n\nSign up to receive headlines in your inbox! Breaking News | Local Sports | Daily Headlines | Local Obituaries | Weather | Local Offers Click to Sign up!\n\nAfter playing on offense and defense at St. Joseph, Taomi did some of the same thing at Hancock, though in a different way.\n\n\"I played my first five games at defensive tackle, then I was moved to offensive tackle,\" Taomi said.\n\nHancock earned a share of the 2023 Northern League championship with Ventura then lost to San Diego Mesa in the Strawberry Bowl.\n\nThe Hancock offense is somewhat of a throwback. The Bulldogs often operate out of the I formation and are a run-first offense. Though all-everything USC quarterback Caleb Williams will be playing for the Chicago Bears come the next NFL season, the USC offense will still be a far cry from what Taomi blocked for at Hancock.\n\nStill, \"I'm confident I can adjust to the USC offense,\" said Taomi.\n\nWhen it came to the run and pass, \"We did both when Erwin was at St. Joseph, and Darian Mensah was the quarterback and Carter Vargas was a running back,\" said Villasenor.\n\n\"Erwin has a very high football IQ. I'm confident he'll be able to adjust to the USC offense.\"\n\nBefore graduating from St. Joseph in the spring of 2023, Mensah signed with NCAA Division 1 member Tulane. Vargas signed with Division 1 UC Davis after the 2023 high school football season during his senior year.\n\nTaomi said he will study real estate development at USC.", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kenny_cress_kcress@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Kenny Cress Kcress", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph_High_School_(Metuchen,_New_Jersey)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph High School (Metuchen, New Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-on_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walk-on (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caleb Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_formation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I formation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulane_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulane University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ventura, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Davis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesa, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Campaigns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/fc/3fc54d3a-4a1a-11ef-9c86-7b9c6f2357f1/66a1981681f6f.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761418", "eventUri": "eng-9761418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

There was something entirely different about Big Ten football media days this year.\n\nThe conference officially expands to 18 teams with the addition of Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington on Aug. 2, and this week's media gathering at Lucas Oil Stadium is serving as an introduction of the Ducks, Bruins, Trojans and Huskies to their new conference brethren.\n\nThe Big Ten and the SEC, which poached Oklahoma and Texas from the Big 12, give college football two super conferences and others trying to keep up with varying degrees of success. With the four former Pac-12 teams in the Big Ten fold, Nebraska coach Matt Rhule on Wednesday staked a claim for his league.\n\n\"This is the NFL of college football,\" he said of the Big Ten.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's how that might work Biden drops out of race, endorses VP Harris after disastrous debate inflamed age concerns\n\nWednesday's second day of media appearances featured newcomers USC and UCLA. Oregon and Washington get their podium time Thursday, the same day Gophers coach P.J. Fleck brings quarterback Max Brosmer, running back Darius Taylor and linebacker Cody Lindenberg to the event.\n\nPlayers both steeped in the conference's traditions and new to rivalries spoke about how seeing fresh faces and competing in new venues will provide a spark. Strong opinions from those on the Big Ten side posited these suntanned Californians with their fancy passing games won't be able to match the physicality and grit from the mostly Midwestern conference.\n\nPenn State defensive lineman Dvon J-Thomas looks forward to seeing how the former Pac-12 teams will do when the gales of November come early. \"They're gonna feel this cold,\" J-Thomas said. \"They're out there in sunny California, and they're gonna feel this East Coast cold.\"\n\nNittany Lions teammate Jaylen Reed, a versatile defensive back, expects to see footballs flying from the quartet of newcomers this season.\n\n\"Their style of play is different than the [rest of the] Big Ten,\" said Reed, whose Nittany Lions host UCLA on Oct. 5 before facing USC at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum seven days later. \"We're going to have to get adjusted to their style of play, and they're going to have to adjust to our style of play.\"\n\nAsked if there was anything he was looking forward to when meeting the Trojans and Bruins, Reed said with a smile, \"It brings me more opportunities to get interceptions.\"\n\nUSC quarterback Miller Moss, who passed for 372 yards and six touchdowns in his first career start, a Holiday Bowl win over Louisville in 2023, tried to be diplomatic when refuting those who doubt the former Pac-12 teams.\n\n\"Uh, hmm,\" Miller said, laughing after a long pause. \"I'm trying to follow my media training. ... Obviously, as you go throughout the country, people play different brands of football geographically. That's in large part attributed to the type of player that comes from a geographic area. To now have the crossover between the two will be interesting and provide for more exciting matchups.\"\n\nMiller had a prediction, too: \"We'll introduce some intricacies in game plans that maybe they haven't seen before.\"\n\nTrojans coach Lincoln Riley said he's tweaked his recruiting with the Big Ten move in mind, and USC offensive tackle Jonah Monheim acknowledges the Trojans are trying to put on muscle.\n\n\"Looking at where we were last year and where we need to be in the Big Ten, on the 'O' line there's been a big emphasis on gaining weight and strength,\" the 6-5, 305-pounder said.\n\nHowever, he's not buying the \"soft\" label that some apply to the ex-Pac-12 quartet.\n\n\"That's just the SoCal, L.A. stereotype,\" Monheim said, adding, \"It's wrong because at the end of the day, we all have to play the same game on the same field.\"\n\nJay Toia, a defensive lineman for UCLA, concurred with Monheim.\n\n\"The model of the Big Ten is physicality, but I don't think that's new for us,\" Toia said. \"We had a powerhouse like Utah [in the Pac-12], and we played Oregon State, which is a big, physical run team. I don't think that's anything we can't handle.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Tyler Warren played peacemaker in the end. \"There were some great teams that got added to our conference,\" he said. \"It can only bring up the level our conference and the type of football we play.\"\n\n____\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree

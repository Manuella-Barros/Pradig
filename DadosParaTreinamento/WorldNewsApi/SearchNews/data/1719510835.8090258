Excelerate Energy Inc (NYSE:EE) ranks 5th on this list. Let's see why the CNBC host is bearish on the stock. Jim Cramer in a latest program yet again lamented over the market's obsession about the Fed's stance over sticky inflation, saying the latest Fed minutes from April 30 to May 1 spooked investors because the central bank officials seem to be getting \"impatient\" with the inflation's slower-than-expected decline. However, Cramer said that economic data released after these Fed minutes showed that the labor market as well as inflation are cooling, exactly what the Fed wants. Cramer said had the Fed officials seen this data before, their minutes would have been different. Cramer said that the Fed needs to know that their \"inflation lamentation\" from three weeks ago isn\u2019t necessary. Jim Cramer said that consumer spending has been the biggest issue for the Federal Reserve as they wonder, \"is they any place that's too high for them (consumers).\" Cramer acknowledged that without putting brakes on consumer spending it'd be impossible to beat inflation. However, the CNBC host said that if Fed officials had paid attention they'd have found that they are \"finally\" winning their battle against consumer spending too. Jim Cramer said there are \"nascent signs\" showing that the consumers are finally saying \"enough is enough.\" Cramer pointed to Walmart's latest numbers as a sign of consumers' preference for discount retailers. Cramer said Walmart is one of the few companies offering value in budget.

Recently, a new clip surfaced showing tourists in Spain's Ibiza experiencing an unexpected encounter. They were taken aback while visiting the island Es Vedra where they reportedly witnessed a UFO.\n\nIn the viral video, a few tourists are captured rushing towards a mysterious light in the sky.

While relaxing on a cliff, a group witnessed an unidentified flying object next to the moon, sparking a frenzy and widespread debate on social media.\n\nThe sighting, captured on video and shared by Pubity on Instagram, shows a white speck moving erratically through the sky before disappearing. The clip quickly garnered numerous comments, with viewers speculating on the object's identity. While some dismissed it as a drone, others jokingly referenced the famous song, \"Bro that UFO took a pill in Ibiza.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time such sightings have been reported in the region. According to the Majorca Bulletin, the town of S\u00f3ller in nearby Mallorca was a hotspot for UFO sightings from the 1970s to the 1990s. This recent Ibiza sighting also follows the US Congress's decision to demand the disclosure of certain UFO records, adding fuel to the fire of public curiosity.\n\nMaria Calafat, working on a UFO project for Netflix, believes the increased openness about UFO records is encouraging more people to share their experiences.\n\nThe recent UFO sighting in Ibiza has sparked a wave of intrigue and debate, drawing attention from tourists and social media users alike. While some remain skeptical, attributing the sighting to more mundane explanations like drones, others find themselves captivated by the mysterious nature of the event. This incident adds to the historical tapestry of UFO sightings in the region, echoing past reports from neighboring Mallorca.\n\nAs global interest in UFO phenomena grows, fueled by legislative actions such as the US Congress's demand for the disclosure of certain UFO records, more individuals are coming forward with their own accounts and footage. This trend is reflected in the increasing number of projects and documentaries exploring the topic, including those by influencers and media professionals like Maria Calafat.\n\nWhether you're a skeptic or a believer, the Ibiza sighting serves as a reminder of the enduring human fascination with the unknown and the allure of the mysteries that lie beyond our everyday experiences. As technology and media continue to evolve, we can expect more such sightings to come to light, each one adding a new chapter to the ever-expanding narrative of unexplained aerial phenomena.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unidentified flying object"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibiza", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ibiza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibiza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00f3ller", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00f3ller"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00f3ller"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skepticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/UFOs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/compressed_ibiza_sunset.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777461", "eventUri": "eng-9777461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

As the camera captures the light hovering near the moon, it suddenly zips through the sky in mere seconds, eliciting gasps from the onlookers.\n\nReactions in the comments section ranged from jokes to serious discussions about extraterrestrial life.\n\nOne user quipped, \"Aliens are tryna party with us,\" while another added, \"Not gonna lie I do believe these things only because it's not new.

Between the 1970s and the 1990s, areas like Soller and the Serra de Tramuntana were considered hot spots for UFO activity, particularly following the infamous 'Manises case'.\n\nRead also: Canadian couple spot UFOs\n\nOn October 12, 1979, a plane with over 100 passengers en route from Palma to Tenerife encountered a set of red lights approaching at high speed. Despite radioing for information, neither the military radar centre in Madrid nor the flight control centre in Barcelona could explain the phenomenon. Consequently, the captain made an emergency landing at Manises Airport in Valencia to avert a potential disaster.\n\nThese mysterious lights were also seen by several witnesses in S\u00f3ller, including Joan Coll and Pep Climent. Climent managed to capture a photograph of the lights, but the next day, Air Force officers demanded he hand over the image.\n\nOver 40 years later, this UFO mystery might be revived in a Netflix series. A film by two Mallorcans, Maria Calafat and Marta Mesquida, was selected by the Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival. The script, still in development, is among the projects chosen by Netflix and the CIMA Association of Women Filmmakers. \"The recent declassification of thousands of UFO files by the US Congress has made these cases fashionable again,\" says Maria Calafat, who has always been fascinated by ufology.\n\nScreenwriter, producer, and CIMA co-founder Marta Mesquida aims to recapture the atmosphere in Soller during that period. The plot revolves around the murder of a ufologist studying the existence of an alien submarine base in Puerto Soller.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express

Unconvinced by the sighting, one person said: \"It's probably just a drone,\" as another sceptic joked: \"Bro that UFO took a pill in Ibiza.\"\n\nMeanwhile, someone else quipped: \"They saw the bottled water prices n zoomed,\" while one more scoffed: \"Ohhh yes because every video starts with 'hey I'm going to run towards the edge and scream look look look' nice try.\"\n\nAccording to the Majorca Bulletin, this isn't the first time a UFO has been spotted in the region.

We regularly cover wild UFO videos, including a recent one about a fireball.\n\nIf you want to grab my attention, sparking up a conversation about UFOs is a great way to do it. However, we also have to exercise caution when it comes to what we believe.\n\nThat leads me to a wild video out of Brazil.\n\nA video is going viral on YouTube that allegedly shows a UFO over Curitiba, Brazil, and the video's caption reads as follows (via Google Translate):\n\n\"I NEVER BELIEVED IN A UFO UNTIL LAST SUNDAY 21\\07\\2024. WHEN I FILMED THIS UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A DRONE, BUT IT HAD NO SPELLS. THEN I THOUGHT IT WAS A BALLOON BUT THE TRAJECTORY WAS IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND SOMETHING SIMILAR TO A 'LANDING GEAR' APPEARED.\"\n\nDo I have your attention now? Take a look at the video below, and let me know what you think at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nDoes it look real? It does, and that's part of the problem. It's almost too good to be true. A good lesson in life is that if something perfectly fits a predetermined narrative, then it's probably not fully accurate.\n\nIt almost looks exactly like a UFO out of popular movies and TV shows. What are the odds aliens are here and they just by pure chance modeled their crafts the same way Hollywood imagined they would? Seems unlikely.\n\nThe person who posted the video ruled out that it was a drone captured on video. Why are we ruling that out? We don't know it's not a drone. In fact, I'd feel way more comfortable guessing it's a drone than an alien craft.\n\nThere's also another option that can't be ruled out. How do we know the video isn't entirely CGI generated? With AI getting more and more advanced, you have to keep your head on swivel when it comes to what's real and what's not.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_hookstead@outkick.com", "name": "David Hookstead", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unidentified flying object"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteoroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajectory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curitiba", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curitiba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Curitiba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/8386ee27-UFO.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777461", "eventUri": "eng-9777461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

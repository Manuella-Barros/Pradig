{"id": 225057296, "title": "Karen Read trial recap: What John O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said on the stand", "text": "Taking the stand Tuesday, John O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew recalled frequent verbal fights between their uncle and his girlfriend of two years, Karen Read. The children lived with O\u2019Keefe in Canton for several years after their mother died of brain cancer and their father had a fatal heart attack just months later. A court order barred media outlets from naming O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece or nephew or livestreaming their testimony, as they are minors. Read, 44, of Mansfield, is accused of drunkenly \u2014 and intentionally \u2014 backing her SUV into O\u2019Keefe and leaving him for dead the morning of Jan. 29, 2022. She has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder, motor vehicle manslaughter while driving under the influence, and leaving the scene of a collision causing injury and death. Prosecutors have pointed to the increasingly strained relationship between Read and O\u2019Keefe as a possible motive. They\u2019ve specifically highlighted flirty texts Read exchanged with another man, as well as a screaming match Read and O\u2019Keefe had during a family vacation to Aruba over New Year\u2019s Eve in 2021. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew \u2014 who were 14 and 10, respectively, at the time he died \u2014 testified Tuesday that they overheard the couple\u2019s argument during the Aruba vacation, according to WHDH. Jurors previously heard testimony about an incident where Read accused O\u2019Keefe of kissing another woman on the trip, though the woman in question said she and O\u2019Keefe only hugged. WBZ reported that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s nephew testified that neither Read nor O\u2019Keefe ever raised a hand at each other in anger. However, \u201cthere was a lot of disagreements and arguments,\u201d the boy reportedly said. According to WCVB, both children also described an incident where O\u2019Keefe asked Read to leave his house and she refused. \u201cShe said no. She was swearing. She got very loud,\u201d O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece said, per WCVB. The couple\u2019s relationship \u201cwas good at the beginning, but it was bad at the end,\u201d the niece testified, according to WHDH. She recalled the moment Read woke her up at 4:30 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2022, and informed her O\u2019Keefe hadn\u2019t come home. According to WHDH, the niece testified that she heard Read on the phone calling people, and she said she remembered Read mentioning an argument with O\u2019Keefe the night before. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece also said Read asked, \u201cWhat if I hit him?\u201d though she testified that Read\u2019s phrasing changed in later conversations, WHDH reported. \u201cShe was just pacing down the hallway, asking what could\u2019ve happened,\u201d the niece testified, according to WCVB. \u201cShe said, \u2018Maybe I did something.\u2019 Later, she said, \u2018Maybe a snowplow hit him.\u2019\u201d As they left the courthouse Tuesday afternoon, Read\u2019s lawyers criticized the prosecution\u2019s decision to call O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew to the stand, WBZ reported. \u201cIt was desperate and inappropriate for the DA\u2019s office to call children to try to prove a nonexistent motive that they failed to prove through their adult witnesses,\u201d defense attorney David Yannetti reportedly said. Read\u2019s trial is not in session the rest of this week. Testimony will resume on Monday, June 3.", "summary": "<p>O'Keefe's niece and nephew recalled signs of friction in their uncle's two-year relationship with Read.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-niece-nephew-testify/\">Karen Read trial recap: What John O\u2019Keefe\u2019s niece and nephew said on the stand</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-niece-nephew-testify/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Officer_Killed_Girlfriend_Trial_78527-66572a6d23db3-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:06:09", "author": "Abby Patkin", "authors": ["Abby Patkin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.514}

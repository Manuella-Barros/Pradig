Not even in Brazil,\" the lawyer appearing for WhatsApp said, adding that the requirement was against the privacy of users and the rule was introduced without any consultation.\n\nThe bench, also comprising Justice Manmeet P S Arora, said privacy rights were not absolute and \"somewhere balance has to be done.\" Central government counsel said the rule was significant when objectionable content is spread on platforms in cases such as those of communal violence.\n\nThe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were announced by the government on February 25, 2021 and required large social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to comply with the latest norms.\n\nThe bench ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on August 14 to await the transfer of all other petitions challenging several aspects of the 2021 IT Rules to it pursuant to a Supreme Court order.\n\nDuring the hearing, WhatsApp's counsel said steps have been taken to \"contain virality\" and it was possible to trace the originator \"traditionally\" by examining the sequence of senders of a message.\n\n\"They say open the entire technology. Is it proportional? I am caught in between,\" he added.\n\nThe counsel also informed the court that all platforms would have to comply with the new data protection law, which deals with collection, processing and sharing of data, once the relevant rules are framed.\n\nIn its petition filed in 2021, WhatsApp has said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits \"at risk\".\n\nWhatsApp LLC has urged the high court to declare Rule 4(2) of the intermediary rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires the IT Act and illegal and sought that no criminal liability be imposed on it for any alleged non-compliance with Rule 4(2) which requires enabling the identification of the first originator of information.\n\nWhatsApp said the traceability provision is unconstitutional and against the fundamental right to privacy.\n\nThe plea has said the traceability requirement forces the company to break end-to-end encryption on its messaging service, as well as the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech of the hundreds of millions of citizens using WhatsApp to communicate privately and securely.\n\nIn its reply, the Centre has said the law empowers it to expect such entities to create safe cyberspace and counter \"illegal content\" either themselves or by assisting the law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Centre has told the court that Section 87 of the Information Technology Act gave it power to formulate Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules which mandates a significant social media intermediary to enable the identification of the first originator of an information in \"legitimate state interest\" of curbing the menace of fake news and offences concerning national security and public order as well as women and children.\n\nThe Centre has also stated that if a platform does not have the means to trace the first originator without breaking the encryption then it is the platform which \"ought to develop such mechanism\" in larger public duty.\n\nOn March 22, the Supreme Court transferred to the Delhi High Court a batch of pleas pending before different high courts across the country challenging the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.\n\nSeveral petitions were pending on the issue before different high courts including Karnataka, Madras, Calcutta, Kerala and Bombay high courts.

Not even in Brazil,\" the lawyer appearing for WhatsApp said, adding that the requirement was against the privacy of users and the rule was introduced without any consultation.\n\nThe bench, also comprising Justice Manmeet P S Arora, said privacy rights were not absolute and \"somewhere balance has to be done.\" Central government counsel said the rule was significant when objectionable content is spread on platforms in cases such as those of communal violence.\n\nThe Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 were announced by the government on February 25, 2021 and required large social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to comply with the latest norms.\n\nThe bench ordered that the matter be listed for hearing on August 14 to await the transfer of all other petitions challenging several aspects of the 2021 IT Rules to it pursuant to a Supreme Court order.\n\nDuring the hearing, WhatsApp's counsel said steps have been taken to \"contain virality\" and it was possible to trace the originator \"traditionally\" by examining the sequence of senders of a message.\n\n\"They say open the entire technology. Is it proportional? I am caught in between,\" he added.\n\nThe counsel also informed the court that all platforms would have to comply with the new data protection law, which deals with collection, processing and sharing of data, once the relevant rules are framed.\n\nIn its petition filed in 2021, WhatsApp has said the requirement of intermediaries enabling the identification of the first originator of information in India upon government or court order puts end-to-end encryption and its benefits \"at risk\".\n\nWhatsApp LLC has urged the high court to declare Rule 4(2) of the intermediary rules as unconstitutional, ultra vires the IT Act and illegal and sought that no criminal liability be imposed on it for any alleged non-compliance with Rule 4(2) which requires enabling the identification of the first originator of information.\n\nWhatsApp said the traceability provision is unconstitutional and against the fundamental right to privacy.\n\nThe plea has said the traceability requirement forces the company to break end-to-end encryption on its messaging service, as well as the privacy principles underlying it, and infringes upon the fundamental rights to privacy and free speech of the hundreds of millions of citizens using WhatsApp to communicate privately and securely.\n\nIn its reply, the Centre has said the law empowers it to expect such entities to create safe cyberspace and counter \"illegal content\" either themselves or by assisting the law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Centre has told the court that Section 87 of the Information Technology Act gave it power to formulate Rule 4(2) of the Intermediary Rules which mandates a significant social media intermediary to enable the identification of the first originator of an information in \"legitimate state interest\" of curbing the menace of fake news and offences concerning national security and public order as well as women and children.\n\nThe Centre has also stated that if a platform does not have the means to trace the first originator without breaking the encryption then it is the platform which \"ought to develop such mechanism\" in larger public duty.\n\nOn March 22, the Supreme Court transferred to the Delhi High Court a batch of pleas pending before different high courts across the country challenging the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.\n\nSeveral petitions were pending on the issue before different high courts including Karnataka, Madras, Calcutta, Kerala and Bombay high courts.

The clauses of Dispute Resolution and the Governing Law are reproduced below to testify the same.\n\nFacebook and Whatsapp have recently challenged the new rules on grounds that they violate the right to privacy and are unconstitutional.\n\nMinistry has also told the Delhi High Court that if the IT Rules 2021 are not implemented, the law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in tracing the origin of fake messages and such messages will percolate in other platforms thereby disturbing peace and harmony in the society further leading to public order issues.\n\nThe affidavit further stated that MeitY's approach to the framing of legislation and rules is founded on the principles that the Internet should be open, safe trusted, Platforms should be accountable to users and no one should be allowed to take away the fundamental rights of Indian citizens guaranteed by the Constitution of India.\n\nIt added that the said statutory provision and the Rules are merely a manifestation of settled global jurisprudence developing around the secondary liability or responsibility of intermediaries in the changing dynamic of human interactions that World-wide-web and the platforms in the nature of \"significant social media intermediaries\" enable.\n\nIt also submitted that significant social media intermediaries assist and enable exchange and publication of ideas and information between persons by providing a platform accessible to all at an enormous scale and speed, which has been unforeseen in human history.\n\nIt is submitted that the principle of secondary liability or responsibility on part of significant social media intermediaries provides that despite the intermediary not being the creator of the problematic or illegal content, such significant social media intermediaries would have to abide by certain stipulations in case such problematic content breaches the stipulations of the law as it enables projecting or publicising or advertising the content.\n\nIt is submitted that the platform that is provided by the significant social media intermediaries, casts a corresponding responsibility on the same in the nature of due diligence and cooperation in case of the legislatively demarcated fields.\n\nEarlier WhatsApp through its statement had said \"Requiring messaging apps to 'trace' chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people's right to privacy.\"\n\nA WhatsApp spokesperson said, \"We have consistently joined civil society and experts around the world in opposing requirements that would violate the privacy of our users. In the meantime, we will also continue to engage with the Government of India on practical solutions aimed at keeping people safe, including responding to valid legal requests for the information available to us.\"\n\nOn February 25, the Centre framed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, in the exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011.\n\nThe new guidelines issued by the government of India mandated a grievance redressal system for over the top (OTT) and digital portals in the country.

The clauses of Dispute Resolution and the Governing Law are reproduced below to testify the same.\n\nFacebook and Whatsapp have recently challenged the new rules on grounds that they violate the right to privacy and are unconstitutional.\n\nMinistry has also told the Delhi High Court that if the IT Rules 2021 are not implemented, the law enforcement agencies will have difficulty in tracing the origin of fake messages and such messages will percolate in other platforms thereby disturbing peace and harmony in the society further leading to public order issues.\n\nThe affidavit further stated that MeitY's approach to the framing of legislation and rules is founded on the principles that the Internet should be open, safe trusted, Platforms should be accountable to users and no one should be allowed to take away the fundamental rights of Indian citizens guaranteed by the Constitution of India.\n\nIt added that the said statutory provision and the Rules are merely a manifestation of settled global jurisprudence developing around the secondary liability or responsibility of intermediaries in the changing dynamic of human interactions that World-wide-web and the platforms in the nature of \"significant social media intermediaries\" enable.\n\nIt also submitted that significant social media intermediaries assist and enable exchange and publication of ideas and information between persons by providing a platform accessible to all at an enormous scale and speed, which has been unforeseen in human history.\n\nIt is submitted that the principle of secondary liability or responsibility on part of significant social media intermediaries provides that despite the intermediary not being the creator of the problematic or illegal content, such significant social media intermediaries would have to abide by certain stipulations in case such problematic content breaches the stipulations of the law as it enables projecting or publicising or advertising the content.\n\nIt is submitted that the platform that is provided by the significant social media intermediaries, casts a corresponding responsibility on the same in the nature of due diligence and cooperation in case of the legislatively demarcated fields.\n\nEarlier WhatsApp through its statement had said \"Requiring messaging apps to 'trace' chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people's right to privacy.\"\n\nA WhatsApp spokesperson said, \"We have consistently joined civil society and experts around the world in opposing requirements that would violate the privacy of our users. In the meantime, we will also continue to engage with the Government of India on practical solutions aimed at keeping people safe, including responding to valid legal requests for the information available to us.\"\n\nOn February 25, the Centre framed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules 2021, in the exercise of powers under section 87 (2) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and in supersession of the earlier Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines) Rules 2011.\n\nThe new guidelines issued by the government of India mandated a grievance redressal system for over the top (OTT) and digital portals in the country.

WhatsApp added that people use the platform because of the privacy its end-to-end encryption offers, and that breaking it would undermine trust.\n\nThe court was hearing petitions filed by WhatsApp and its parent company Meta challenging Rule 4(2) of the Information Technology Rules, 2021. Rule 4(2) says 'significant' social media intermediaries (those with more than five million registered users) must be able to identify the first originator of any information (text, photo, video, etc) on its platform when ordered to do so by a court or another competent authority.\n\nAlso read: Centre to soon bring amendments to IT rules to curb deepfakes\n\nThe company said that complying with the rule would require storing vast numbers of messages for extended periods, which no other country mandates. It said the rule exceeded the scope of its parent law, the Information Technology Act, which does not mandate breaking encryption. When questioned by the bench about similar laws in other countries, WhatsApp confirmed that no other country has made such a request.\n\nThe government argued that there must be a mechanism in place to trace the originators of messages, citing the need for accountability. The court acknowledged the need for balance in addressing these concerns and adjourned the case to 14 August, when it will be heard along with more than a dozen other cases challenging various parts of the IT Rules that the Supreme Court had transferred to the Delhi High Court on 22 March.\n\nThe IT Rules, ostensibly meant to ensure accountability on social-media and digital-news platforms, have been challenged in various high courts, including those in Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu for potentially violating privacy rights and encouraging self-censorship.\n\nPetitioners include social-media companies such as Meta, as well as news organisations such as The Quint, The Leaflet, and LiveLaw. The Bombay, Madras and Kerala high courts have put the implementation of the IT Rules on hold, while the other cases are pending.\n\nAlso read: How AI will be a double-edged sword to boost fake news, curb voting manipulations in Lok Sabha polls\n\nMilestone Alert!

The companies argue that the law weakens encryption and violates user privacy protections under the Indian Constitution.\n\nThe messaging platform argued that the rules undermines encryption of content as well as the privacy of the users. It also violates fundamental rights of the users guaranteed under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India.\n\n\"There is no such rule anywhere else in the world. Not even in Brazil. We will have to keep a complete chain and we don't know which messages will be asked to be decrypted. It means millions and millions of messages will have to be stored for a number of years,\" Karia said.\n\nWhat the government has to say\n\nHowever, Kirtiman Singh, appearing for the central government, defended the regulations, emphasising the need to trace message originators. Singh argued that such a mechanism is essential in today's environment.\n\nThe Delhi High Court listed the petitions by WhatsApp and Meta for hearing on August 14.

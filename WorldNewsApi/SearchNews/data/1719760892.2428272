Security Council resolution that would demand an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and order Israel to halt its military offensive in the southern city of Rafah immediately. The draft resolution, obtained Wednesday evening by The Associated Press, also demands that the cease-fire be respected by all parties. It also calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken during Hamas\u2019 attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Some diplomats said they hoped for a quick vote, even as early as Wednesday. \u201cIt is our hope that it can be done as quickly as possible because life is in the balance,\u201d Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong told reporters. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said: \u201cWe\u2019re waiting to see it and then we\u2019ll react to it.\u201d The United States has vetoed multiple resolutions demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. The draft demands compliance with previous Security Council resolutions that call for the opening of all border crossings and humanitarian access to Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million people who desperately need food and other aid. The proposed resolution says that \u201cthe catastrophic situation in the Gaza Strip constitutes a threat to regional and international peace and security.\u201d It expresses grave concern at \u201cfamine spreading throughout the Gaza Strip\u201d and the suffering of Palestinians who took refuge in Rafah. The resolution would demand that Israel \u201cimmediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in Rafah.\u201d The draft condemns what it calls \u201cthe indiscriminate targeting of civilians, including women and children, and civilian infrastructure\u201d and reiterates the council\u2019s demand for all parties to comply with international law requiring the protection of civilians. Algeria\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Amar Bendjama, who is also the Arab representative on the Security Council, told reporters after emergency closed council consultations Tuesday that he would be sending the draft resolution to the 15-member council later in the evening. Algeria called the emergency council meeting as Israel pushed ahead with its military operation in Rafah, where over a million Palestinians had sought refuge. It followed Sunday night\u2019s Israeli airstrikes that triggered a fire engulfing tents in a camp for displaced Palestinians west of Rafah, killing 45 people and injured over 100 others.", "summary": "Algeria is circulating a proposed U.N.

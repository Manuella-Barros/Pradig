You can check out at any time. More info\n\nResidents in Edinburgh have told of their horror after a police officer was hit by a stolen car in an alleged \"attempted murder\" right on their doorsteps.\n\nEmergency services raced to the Shell petrol station on Stenhouse Road after the alarm was raised at around 7.25pm on Tuesday. Officers were responding to reports of a crash involving a car and a pedestrian.\n\nPolice later confirmed the pedestrian was a 32-year-old male cop who was on foot when he was injured in an incident involving a stolen Mercedes GLE. He was taken to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with serious, but not life-threatening injuries, and has since been discharged.\n\nThe vehicle had been reported stolen from Gorgie Road at around 7.05pm. A 16-year-old boy was a passenger within the vehicle at the time of the theft and managed to exit it a short time later. He was not injured in the incident.\n\nA 27-year-old man has been arrested in connection with numerous charges, including attempted murder, theft of a motor vehicle, abduction, dangerous driving and other road traffic offences. He is expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday.\n\nJim, a social worker and life-long resident in the area, lives across the street from the Shell station on Stenhouse Road. The local says he heard a loud thump when the Merc collided with a low brick wall after striking the officer. He then sprinted to investigate when his wife saw blue lights from first responders.\n\nJim told Edinburgh Live: \"It was shocking - but my first thought was 'what was the police officer doing there?' Was he in pursuit? It seems unlikely he would be on foot unless he was off duty. I haven't seen a police officer on foot in this area in decades.\"\n\nJim was born on Stenhouse Road and said the drama was out of the ordinary. He continued: \"Nothing like that usually happens around here. It's a relatively quiet area.\"\n\nAnother Stenhouse Road resident also reacted with shock, adding: \"A few traffic accidents happen on this road, but it's not often, and it's never something like this. This is a peaceful, quiet area.\n\n\"Especially at that time [last night], there were kids walking around and it was the summertime rush hour.\"\n\nOne woman who lived near the Shell station said she had not seen the drama unfold but was surprised by the incident. She added: \"I've lived in the area for 21 years and haven't seen anything like this. It's just quite unusual. We don't get many crimes. We even keep our doors open when we sleep at night.\"\n\nA trail of destruction was left in the wake of the incident. A crushed Volkswagen was still on the garage forecourt on Wednesday morning with a smashed lamp post and brick wall nearby.\n\nA huge police presence was seen during the incident with road users urged to avoid the area last night. Detective Inspector David McAlinden confirmed several vehicles were caught up with the events on Tuesday night.\n\nHe said: \"This was a very serious incident and we are continuing to provide support to the officer and his family. I would like to thank members of the public for quickly coming to our colleague's aid and for their assistance with our enquiries at the scene.\n\n\"We are aware that damage was done to several vehicles in the area during the incident and we would encourage any further witnesses, or anyone with information who have yet to speak with police, to please come forward.\n\n\"You can contact police on 101, quoting incident 2997 of July 9, 2024.

He was conveyed to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with serious, but not life-threatening injuries, and has since been discharged.\n\nThe vehicle had been reported stolen from Gorgie Road around 7.05pm that evening.

He is expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday, July 11, 2024.\n\nJim, a social worker and life-long Stenhouse resident, lives across the street from the Shell station on Stenhouse Road.\n\nHe heard a loud thump when the GLE motor collided with a low brick wall after striking the officer. He sprinted to investigate when his wife saw blue lights from first responders.\n\nREAD MORE - Hero Edinburgh police officer rushed to hospital after 'attempted murder'\n\nREAD MORE - Scottish ex-Major General with decorated career charged with sexual assault\n\nJim said: \"It was shocking - the fact that a car had been stolen just down the road, and a 16-year-old laddy was in the car.\n\n\"But my first thought was 'what was the police officer doing there?' Was he in pursuit? It seems unlikely he would be on foot unless he was off duty. I haven't seen a police officer on foot in this area in decades.\"\n\nJim was born on Stenhouse Road and said that last night's occurrence was out of the ordinary.\n\nHe continued: \"Nothing like that usually happens around here. It's a relatively quiet area.\"\n\nAnother Stenhouse Road resident also reacted with shock at the incident. They said: \"A few traffic accidents happen on this road, but it's not often, and it's never something like this. This is a peaceful, quiet area.\n\n\"Especially at that time [last night], there were kids walking around and it was the summertime rush hour.\"\n\nOne woman who lived near the Shell station said she had not seen the drama unfold but was surprised by the incident.\n\n\"I've lived in the area for 21 years and haven't seen anything like this. It's just quite unusual,\" she said. \"We don't get many crimes. We even keep our doors open when we sleep at night.\"\n\nA trail of destruction was left in the wake of the incident. A crippled Volkswagen was still on the garage forecourt on Wednesday morning with a smashed lamp post and brick wall nearby.\n\nBut one resident was thankful more damage was avoided. The resident said: \"Otherwise, the car would've gone into the street and maybe hit traffic.\"\n\nJoin Edinburgh Live's Whatsapp Community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages.\n\nSign up for Edinburgh Live newsletters for more headlines straight to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "edinburghlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "edinburghlive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_malizia@edinburghlive.co.uk", "name": "Nicholas Malizia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Infirmary_of_Edinburgh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filling_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filling station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgie", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gorgie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gorgie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Sheriff_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh Sheriff Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_plc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traffic collision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Offroad Vehicles", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.edinburghlive.co.uk/incoming/article29516057.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_WhatsApp-Image-2024-07-10-at-123414jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720727", "eventUri": "eng-9720727", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 211, "textEnd": 217}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 908, "textEnd": 915}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

On her Instagram after the accomplishment, Biles, 27, posted a picture of the team with a brutal caption.\n\n'Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,' the post read, in what seems to be a specific dig at former Team USA gymnast Skinner, who criticised the team's makeup in the run-up to the games.\n\nThe members of the USA women's gymnastics team after winning the team gold medal in Paris\n\nSimone Biles captioned her celebration post with a veiled shot at a former Team USA member\n\nMyKayla Skinner, a member of the 2020 Olympic team, criticized the 2024 team's work ethic\n\nSkinner posted a picture on Instagram congratulating the US team for their gold in Paris\n\nRead More Simone Biles fires back at former USA teammate who said Olympics roster does not have 'work ethic'\n\nIn a now-deleted YouTube video, Skinner blasted the team of Biles, Chiles, Lee, Carey, and Hezly Rivera for not having the right 'work ethic'.\n\n'Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be,' the 27-year-old said.\n\n'The girls just don't have the work ethic,' Skinner continued before referencing the US Center for SafeSport - a non-profit organization set up to reduce sexual abuse of minors and athletes in US Olympic sports.\n\n'And it's hard too because of SafeSport. Like, coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say.\n\n'Which, in some ways, is really good. But at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.'\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of that, Biles clapped back at Skinner, writing on Threads, 'not everyone needs a mic and a platform'.\n\nBiles and a number of other gymnasts, including Chiles, Lee, and Carey, all blocked Skinner on social media after her comments.\n\nSkinner would later go on to apologize for her comments.\n\nSkinner, who won a silver medal on vault at the 2020 Games in Tokyo after stepping in for Biles, recently criticized the 2024 Olympic gymnastics roster for not having 'work ethic'\n\nBiles blocked Skinner after her criticisms, despite the gymnast issuing an apology\n\nRead More Olivia Dunne celebrates Simone Biles and Team USA's gymnastics gold in Paris\n\n'I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials.

I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologize.'\n\nSkinner would finish her apology by wishing the gymnasts luck in Paris and that she would be 'cheering you all on!'\n\nA number of people left comments under the post - with some recognizing who its intended target was.\n\n'NEVER A DOUBT', wrote American Olympic skiing sensation Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n'F AROUND AND FIND OUT,' wrote Biles' husband and Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens - who also commented 'Gold medalist'.\n\n'This caption is also worthy of a gold medal,' wrote one Biles fan.\n\nSimone Biles holds an American flag celebrating her Olympic Gold victory in Paris\n\nSimone Biles tastes her gold medal after winning the team event in Paris, France\n\nAnother said, 'Lol she's probably so jealous that you guys won.'\n\n'IN THAT FKN ORDER LACK OF TALENT & LAZY OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS,' wrote another fan. 'Simone you a menace for this caption.'\n\nBiles and Skinner both represented Team USA at a number of competitions - including at the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThey picked up Olympic medals in Tokyo, despite Biles withdrawing from several events with a case of the 'twisties' - a mental block that that sees a gymnast lose control of their body during a twisting skill in midair.\n\nBut now she has her redemption: winning a second team Olympic gold and her fifth overall Olympic gold medal.\n\nReflecting on the achievement, Biles told DailyMail.com that the pressure in Paris was different to the past, but her experience helped guide her through.\n\n'In 2016 we were destined to win gold and everybody said we were destined to win gold, so whenever we went out there we did our job and we did win gold.\n\n'We were a little young and na\u00efve so it didn't hit the way that it does now. Now that I am much older and we have so much more experience and we are out here really having fun and enjoying what we are doing.\n\nSimone Biles competes on the balance beam in the women's team final in Paris, France\n\n'So I think it is just different and it is not to say that I wasn't shocked that we won because it was still super surprising, my first gold medal ever. It was so exciting. But I think the pressure was so on for us to win gold so we did just did what we were supposed to do.\n\n'Even going into tonight, we just did what we had to do, but it just felt a little bit different. It was super exciting, we had fun out there and we just did our gymnastics.\n\nSimone added: 'We're super excited. We're honored to represent the US every time we get on a world stage but accomplishing that gold and that goal was just an amazing feeling.\n\n'I think we all had something to prove from Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and tonight we did just that.\n\n'It means the world. This was our goal going in, even though we didn't share it with everybody because it's just a personal thing that we were working on. But I think for everybody it's what we came here to do. And we're super excited to walk away with that gold medal.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Center_for_SafeSport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Center for SafeSport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Dunne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Dunne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikaela_Shiffrin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikaela Shiffrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balance beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/31/04/87973195-0-image-m-7_1722394969720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 3080, "textEnd": 3086}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

Controversy Explained", "body": "Following her recent victory at the Paris Olympics, Simone Biles seemed to make a comment directed at her former teammate, MyKayla Skinner, sparking considerable interest and speculation among fans. This intrigue stems from Biles's social media posts that appeared to reference a prior controversy involving Skinner. Fans are now eager to uncover what happened between the former gymnastic teammates. Here are all the details.\n\nWhat did Simone Biles say about MyKayla Skinner?\n\nFollowing her gold medal victory at the Paris Olympics, Simone Biles appeared to address past comments from MyKayla Skinner. Biles shared photos of her along with Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, and Hezly Rivera celebrating their win in the women's gymnastics team final. Her Instagram post featured a caption that read, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\"\n\nThe controversy began when Skinner, in a now-deleted YouTube video, expressed doubts about the depth of talent among U.S. gymnasts, claiming that many lacked the necessary work ethic. She said, \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't like what it used to be. A lot of girls don't work as hard. The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nSkinner also suggested that the U.S. Center for SafeSport, which addresses abuse in sports, might be limiting coaches' ability to push athletes effectively. Skinner's comments drew criticism from several members of the gymnastics community, including Biles. She posted on Threads that \"Not everyone needs a mic and a platform.\"\n\nFollowing the backlash, Skinner issued a public apology, clarifying that her comments were not intended to offend or belittle the efforts of her fellow gymnasts. She emphasized that her remarks were misinterpreted.\n\nBoth Simone Biles and MyKayla Skinner had significant roles at the Tokyo Olympics. Biles struggled with the \"twisties,\" a mental block affecting her performance, and Skinner stepped in to compete after Biles withdrew from several events.

Plus, every event streaming ad free, live and on demand with 4K on Stan Sport.\n\nIn early July, Skinner claimed in a YouTube video that the current American women's gymnastics team doesn't \"work as hard\" and doesn't have the \"talent or depth\" of the women's gymnasts who came before them.\n\n\"Coaches can't get on athletes which in some ways is really good but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be ... a little aggressive, a little intense,\" Skinner alleged in the video.\n\nSkinner partially credited SafeSport, which is an independent organisation designed to respond to and prevent \"sexual, physical, and emotional abuse\" in the United States Olympic and Paralympic teams, for why she believes current gymnasts have changed their training approach.\n\nAfter Skinner's initial remarks, Biles wrote on Threads that \"not everyone needs a mic and a platform.\"\n\nSkinner then issued a statement apologising for her remarks after the backlash, saying via X (formerly Twitter), \"I want to formally apologise to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials.\"\n\n\"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work,\" she continued.\n\n\"Your hard work and dedication has paid off and I congratulate each and every one of you.\"\n\n\"Upon reflection, I was comparing the 'M\u00e1rta Era' to the current era,\" Skinner wrote, referencing the allegations made against controversial coaching couple M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi and B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi.\n\n\"I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under M\u00e1rta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologise.\n\n\"It is most important to me that the sport I love continue down the path of healing and ensures a positive environment for all,\" her statement concluded.\n\n\"I wish you all the very best in Paris. I will be cheering you all on! Go Team USA!\"\n\nBiles and Skinner were both members of Team USA for Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020, with Skinner travelling as Biles' alternate in 2016, and then taking Biles' place in 2020 when Biles dropped out due to the \"twisties\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Biles became the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time when the women's team won gold.\n\nSkinner, meanwhile, retired after Tokyo 2020, which saw her take home a silver medal.", "source": {"uri": "nine.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "nine.com.au"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Like, coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say.\n\n'Which, in some ways, is really good. But at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.'\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of that, Biles clapped back at Skinner, writing on Threads, 'not everyone needs a mic and a platform'.\n\nBiles and a number of other gymnasts, including Chiles, Lee, and Carey, all blocked Skinner on social media after her comments.\n\nSkinner would later go on to apologize for her comments.\n\n'I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials. It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work,' Skinner's apology from July 6 read.\n\nShe continued, 'Upon reflection I was comparing the 'Marta [Karolyi] era' to the current era. I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under Marta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologize.'\n\nSkinner would finish her apology by wishing the gymnasts luck in Paris and that she would be 'cheering you all on!'\n\nA number of people left comments under the post - with some recognizing who its intended target was.\n\n'NEVER A DOUBT', wrote American Olympic skiing sensation Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\n'F AROUND AND FIND OUT,' wrote Biles' husband and Chicago Bears safety Jonathan Owens - who also commented 'Gold medalist'.\n\n'This caption is also worthy of a gold medal,' wrote one Biles fan.\n\nAnother said, 'Lol she's probably so jealous that you guys won.'\n\n'IN THAT FKN ORDER LACK OF TALENT & LAZY OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS,' wrote another fan. 'Simone you a menace for this caption.'\n\nBiles and Skinner both represented Team USA at a number of competitions - including at the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThey picked up Olympic medals in Tokyo, despite Biles withdrawing from several events with a case of the 'twisties' - a mental block that that sees a gymnast lose control of their body during a twisting skill in midair.\n\nBut now she has her redemption: winning a second team Olympic gold and her fifth overall Olympic gold medal.\n\nReflecting on the achievement, Biles told DailyMail.com that the pressure in Paris was different to the past, but her experience helped guide her through.\n\n'In 2016 we were destined to win gold and everybody said we were destined to win gold, so whenever we went out there we did our job and we did win gold.\n\n'We were a little young and na\u00efve so it didn't hit the way that it does now. Now that I am much older and we have so much more experience and we are out here really having fun and enjoying what we are doing.\n\n'So I think it is just different and it is not to say that I wasn't shocked that we won because it was still super surprising, my first gold medal ever. It was so exciting. But I think the pressure was so on for us to win gold so we did just did what we were supposed to do.\n\n'Even going into tonight, we just did what we had to do, but it just felt a little bit different. It was super exciting, we had fun out there and we just did our gymnastics.\n\nSimone added: 'We're super excited. We're honored to represent the US every time we get on a world stage but accomplishing that gold and that goal was just an amazing feeling.\n\n'I think we all had something to prove from Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and tonight we did just that.\n\n'It means the world. This was our goal going in, even though we didn't share it with everybody because it's just a personal thing that we were working on. But I think for everybody it's what we came here to do. And we're super excited to walk away with that gold medal.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Center_for_SafeSport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Center for SafeSport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikaela_Shiffrin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikaela Shiffrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skiing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skiing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Simone-Biles-RIPS-MyKayla-Skinner-with-BRUTAL.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1991, "textEnd": 1997}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

But Biles' words were a direct response to recent comments by MyKayla Skinner, a former US gymnast who won a silver medal on vault at the 2020 Olympics.\n\nSkinner stirred up controversy after this year's US Olympic trials when she posted a video to YouTube sharing her criticism of the team's talent, depth and work ethic beyond Biles.\n\n\"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and the depth just isn't what it used to be,\" Skinner said. \"I mean, obviously, a lot of girls just don't work as hard.

Skinner claimed during a July YouTube video that the current group of women \"don't work as hard\" or have the \"talent or depth\" of those who came before them.\n\n\"The shade of it all \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 you better GOAT! \ud83d\udc10,\" one person wrote in the comments section of Biles' Tuesday post, while another replied, \"F AROUND AND FIND OUT.\" A third person added, \"THIS CAPTION WINS A GOLD MEDAL.\"\n\nAt the time of her initial remarks, Skinner partially credited SafeSport, an independent organization designed to prevent and respond \"to sexual, physical, and emotional abuse\" in the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic movement, for why she believes gymnasts have changed their approach to training.\n\n\"Coaches can't get on athletes which in some ways is really good but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be ... a little aggressive, a little intense,\" she alleged in the video.\n\nFollowing her claims, members of Team USA took to social media to respond. Biles noted via Threads that \"not everyone needs a mic and a platform,\" while Chiles' mother, Gina, wrote via X, \"Whoa. She really said that out loud and posted it. That's something.\"\n\nSkinner, meanwhile, has since apologized for her actions, claiming she was \"misinterpreted\" and \"misunderstood.\"\n\n\"A lot of the stuff I was talking about wasn't always necessarily about the current team because I love and support all the girls that made it and I'm so proud of them,\" Skinner explained via a July Instagram Story. \"It was more about going back into my own gym and the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the Marta [Karolyi] era.\"\n\nBiles and Skinner have a long history together, as they were both members of Team USA for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. In 2016, Skinner traveled to Rio as an alternate while Biles won her first Olympic gold medals. Four years later, Skinner took Biles' place in the vault final when Biles dropped out due to the \"twisties,\" a term used to describe a gymnast's loss of control during competition.\n\nWhile Skinner, who said the Tokyo Olympics would be her last before retirement, took home the silver medal that year, she failed to move beyond the qualifying round for the all-around gymnastics final.\n\nDespite Skinner's initial doubts about the 2024 team, Biles and her teammates remained determined at this year's games, taking home the gold on Tuesday. With their win, Biles officially became the most decorated American Olympic gymnast of all time, surpassing Shannon Miller.\n\nThroughout Tuesday's competition, Team USA remained at the top of the leaderboard as Biles, Lee, 21, Chiles, 23, and Carey, 24, showed off their skills on the vault, uneven bars, balance beam and during the floor exercise. The women will follow up their victory at the women's all-around competition on Thursday, August 1, followed by the individual event finals from Saturday, August 3, through Monday, August 5.\n\nDespite suffering a calf injury during the all-around qualifiers on Sunday, July 28, Biles pushed through the pain and taped up her leg after her balance beam routine and continued to compete in her subsequent events.\n\nDuring an interview with Hoda Kotb earlier this month, Biles described this year's games as a \"redemption tour\" for herself and her teammates after walking away with the silver medal four years prior.\n\n\"In Tokyo, we all didn't have our best performances,\" she said, \"so we're excited to go out there and kill it.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType":

She didn't have to.\n\nHours after the U.S. women's gymnastics team claimed the gold medal in Tuesday's team competition, the celebration continued.\n\nFor now five-time Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, that meant taking the message to social media with some late-night posting in Paris. Her new lead Instagram post from early Wednesday local time features a triumphant image of herself and her teammates Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey, Suni Lee and Hezly Rivera celebrating their success with the American flag.\n\nIt was captioned with a message for Skinner, her silver-medalist teammate from the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,\" Biles wrote.\n\nThat was it. Message delivered.\n\nIn case you missed it, Skinner had some harsh words about USA gymnasts not named Biles in a YouTube video that streamed after the Olympic Trials.\n\nSkinner went on to suggest that SafeSport's efforts to end abuse of athletes led to lax coaching that doesn't push athletes hard enough and that Team USA would face weak competition in Paris. She also criticized individual U.S. gymnasts performances in the Olympic Trials.\n\n\"Some of the other girls that fell twice, and still ending up in second place in the all-around is kind of crazy to me,\" Skinner continued.\n\nSkinner, who had a child in September, did not participate in Olympic Trials.\n\nSkinner's comments drew swift backlash from the gymnastics community, including from Biles, who wrote on social media that \"not everyone needs a mic and a platform.\"\n\nSkinner released another video in response to the backlash blaming viewers for having \"misinterpreted or misunderstood exactly what I was meaning or had said\" while claiming that her criticism \"wasn't always necessarily about the current team.\"\n\nThree days later, she issued this apology on Instagram:\n\nThe apology apparently wasn't sufficient for Biles, who carried Skinner's words with her to Paris. Her response was the continued dominance of the sport and the public support of her fellow gold-medal winning teammates.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_owens@aol.com", "name": "Jason Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Rhythmic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kR9YupTwokY4nkL1EIknng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/55dc5fddb534ab7ba01ba0d9de0d2ca8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Biles, joined by teammates Suni Lee, Jordan Chiles and Jade Carey, showcased their superior skills, finishing nearly five-and-a-half points ahead of the Italian team.\n\nIn a post-victory Instagram post, Biles shared a team photo with a caption that read, \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\"\n\nThis comment seemed to address criticisms, particularly from former teammate MyKayla Skinner. Prior to the Olympics, Skinner had expressed doubts about the team's dedication and readiness in a now-deleted YouTube video, specifically mentioning Biles, Chiles, Lee, Carey and Hezly Rivera.\n\n\"And it's hard too because of SafeSport. Like, coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say.\n\n\"Which, in some ways, is really good. But at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.\"\n\nBiles responded to Skinner's remarks on Threads, suggesting that not everyone should have a platform to voice their opinions.\n\nThis response, along with the social media actions of blocking Skinner by Biles and her teammates, underscored the tension following Skinner's comments. Despite this, Biles and her team maintained their focus and delivered a stellar performance that underscored their status as Olympic champions.\n\nSkinner later issued an apology for her statements, acknowledging the controversy.\n\n\"I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials.

A lot of girls don't work as hard.\n\n\"The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nThe response was perfect as Biles and her teammates bounced back from silver in Tokyo to win the team all-round title for the third time in the last four Summer Games.\n\nIn a post on Instagram, Biles said simply \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions \" alongside a gold medal emoji, a heart and the American flag.\n\nSkinner apologized for her comments, which she claimed had been misinterpreted and removed the video - which drew instant criticism from Biles and other gymnasts at the time.\n\nBiles and her Olympics teammates Chiles, Lee and Carey appeared to block Skinner on their social channels.\n\nSkinner had also appeared to suggest that the US Center for SafeSport - the non-profit organization set up to protect minors and athletes in Olympic Sports - had a part to play: \"It's hard too because of SafeSport.\n\n\"Coaches can't get on athletes and they have to be really careful what they say.\"\n\nA host of superstar names have queued up to sing the praises of Biles, while the likes of Serena Williams, Spike Lee, Jason Kelce and wife Kylie, Michael Phelps and the world's number one male golfer Scottie Scheffler were all in attendance to watch Tuesday's gymnastics final.\n\nRousey's response was instant too, with six clapping emojis in response to Biles thinly veiled attack on Skinner - who retired after the Tokyo Games three years ago.\n\nRousey has been a staunch supporter of Biles and back in 2021, when the US superstar withdrew from her event after suffering the 'twisties' she leapt to her defence.\n\n\"Everyone judging @Simone_Biles doesn't know their foot from their a-hole when it comes to being in her position,\" she tweeted at the time.\n\n\"She's on the Olympic team while you're on Twitter. Whatever is going on cannot be grasped from outside. She's doing the absolute best she can given the situation she's in.\"\n\nAs well as Rousey, Biles husband Jonathan Owens - who has been given time off from the Chicago Bears training camp to watch his wife - was quick to offer his response\n\n'F AROUND AND FIND OUT,' Owens posted in response to Biles' celebration picture, a reference to the woman of the hour joking about what the team should be known as. Owens, an NFL star, was also seen taking notes from the stands, while decked out in a t-shirt celebrating his wife.\n\nBiles is well placed for the ultimate response to her Tokyo disappointments.\n\nShe will take to the arena for the women's individual all-round event on Thursday, and is in three separate apparatus finals later in the week.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com",

The series starred Betty White as Rose Nylund, Bea Arthur as Dorothy Zbornak, Rue McClanahan as Blanche Devereaux and Estelle Getty as Sophia Petrillo.\n\nPrior to Biles' confirmation, Tuesday's press conference unearthed an alternative team name as the gold medallists were quizzed by retired Olympian, Aly Raisman, on an official moniker.\n\nAfter a few moments, Biles remarked, \"I'm not gonna say it.\" Chiles, 23, then urged Biles to \"abbreviate\" the X-rated name, which Biles eventually confirmed as \"F -- k Around and Find Out.\"\n\nThe \"official\" team name reveal came after Biles made a seemingly subtle swipe at MyKayla Skinner via Instagram earlier Tuesday evening.\n\n\"Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions,\" Biles captioned a photo of herself holding up an American flag alongside her teammates.\n\nEagle-eyed fans drew comparisons from Biles' caption to 27-year-old Skinner's remarks earlier this month when she criticized the 2024 gymnasts for not having the same \"work ethic\" as those of Team USA past. Skinner claimed during a July YouTube video that the current group of women \"don't work as hard\" or have the \"talent or depth\" of those who came before them.\n\nBiles and Skinner have a long history together, as they were both members of Team USA at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics.\n\nIn 2016, Skinner traveled to Rio as an alternate while Biles won her first Olympic gold medals. Four years later, Skinner took Biles' place in the vault final when Biles dropped out due to the \"twisties,\" a term used to describe a gymnast's loss of control during competition.\n\nThroughout Tuesday's competition, Team \"Golden Girls\" remained at the top of the leaderboard as the athletes showed off their skills on the vault, uneven bars, balance beam and during the floor exercise.\n\nThey will follow up their victory at the women's all-around competition on Thursday, August 1, followed by the individual event finals from Saturday, August 3, through Monday, August 5.",

At first glance, it's just another celebratory post on Simone Biles' Instagram, part of a post-Olympic gold medal-winning reel showing her with her teammates and her husband.\n\nExcept underneath the picture, Biles added a caption: \"lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\"\n\nSomewhere in Paris, Biles dropped the mic directly on MyKayla Skinner's head.\n\nThough Biles didn't reference Skinner, it would seem like the most decorated American gymnast of all time had her former teammate on her mind. After the Olympic Trials, Skinner posted a now-deleted YouTube video, saying in part that \"besides Simone, I feel like the talent and depth isn't what it used to be,\" adding that \"a lot of girls don't work as hard, and don't have the work ethic.\" Skinner, who won silver in 2020 with Biles, went on to say that she thought SafeSport, designed to identify abusive coaches, prevented coaches from pushing gymnasts as hard as necessary, and questioned the strength of the competition at the trials, wondering how someone who \"fell twice\" could finish second.\n\nUnlike so many athletes, who like to pretend they don't read what's written about them, Biles knows what's being said about her. She's keeping the receipts.\n\nSince her comeback post-Tokyo, Biles has spoken openly about the trolls who call her a quitter. She responded immediately to Skinner's comments, posting on social media that \"not everyone needs a mic and a platform.\" Skinner later posted the obligatory apology, saying that the abuse she says she endured at the hands of M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi may have led to her \"hurtful comments.\"\n\nSeems fair to surmise that Biles has not entirely accepted the apology.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dana_o_neil@nytimes.com", "name": "Dana O'Neil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_U.S._Olympic_trials_(gymnastics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 U.S. Olympic trials (gymnastics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e1rta_K\u00e1rolyi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e1rta K\u00e1rolyi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/31063223/GettyImages-2163971586-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

That message obviously resonated with the voters, who elected me after too many years of being fed up with the way business was being done. What I didn't expect was the degree of non-cooperation I've received from the people who've been running the county government all this time.\"\n\nIn particular, Skinner pointed to internal efforts to seemingly prevent him from accessing information from Garvin's administration. That included the alleged shredding of documents, records wrongly reported as missing as well as orders to county staff not to talk to the new treasurer.\n\n\"I feel like I'm in the middle of some strange conspiracy to hide, confuse and impede,\" said Skinner.\n\nUpon taking office, Skinner found financial files crammed into a leaky storage facility holding mildewed boxes, missing and scattered cancelled checks, bank and tax statements and other important financial files littering a tiny, unprotected room.\n\nSkinner said he's receptive to an audit if the county decides to spend the money - but insists it needs to be done accurately and fairly to provide any value at all. Limiting the scope of the treasurer's office review to just the nine months he's been in office \"in my opinion smacks of other motives\" he said, \"especially when so many of the very real existing problems have gone unaddressed for decades.\"\n\nEven the choice of the auditing firm represents a potential conflict of interest. The Baird Audit Group, LLC, has been representing Jasper County with a number of accounting services for the past 17 years.\n\n\"Perhaps the real problem is that county council and staff just don't want to hear what I'm saying,\" said Skinner. \"Maybe they've grown far too comfortable doing things the old ways and accepting the many inefficiencies and ultimately higher tax dollars that go with it. Instead of a smoke screen personally attacking me, wouldn't the county council and the taxpayers they represent be better served addressing the real problems I've already found? That was, after all, why I was elected.\"\n\nSkinner cited a frightening lack of internal controls including bounced checks and even personal checks concerning county business written by the former treasurer to a relative.\n\nIt goes deeper, said Skinner. He referenced a recent failure by the county to fully comply with two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking documents and vital emails that Jasper County Attorney David Tedder has apparently refused to produce, internal departmental transfers of funds without explanation and outright refusals to cooperate from other county staff members.\n\nSkinner holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Technical Management, a business degree from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU), was 2018 Instructor of the Year at Savannah Tech, a senior executive and educator at the Savannah Technical College, has been recognized by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is a retired Marine with multiple tours of overseas service.\n\n\"It's long-since past time for a change in how Jasper County is run,\" said Skinner. \"That's what I ran on, and that's a message that was obviously receptive to voters who are tired of increasing taxes and the difficulties of doing even simple business with their own county government. I've tried to be as accommodating as possible to the county council and staff, but I've been met with nothing but what seems to be resistance and disappointing obstruction simply because I wouldn't just shut up and accept what was left of this office.\"\n\n\"I'm not giving up. Jasper County taxpayers deserve more,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "fitsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FITSNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treasurer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper_County,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasper County, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jasper County, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garvin_County,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garvin County, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Garvin County, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_Technical_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah Technical College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embry\u2013Riddle_Aeronautical_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of Information Act (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/jasper-records.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-03-", "textStart": 870, "textEnd": 878}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

With just one TE commit in the 2025 class, three-star Preston Douglas, the Gamecocks would like to add to that room before it's all said and done.\n\nMikkel Skinner is a four-star TE from Riverside High School in Greer, South Carolina and the second best ranked player in the state. Skinner is a multi-sport athlete who excels on the field, track, and basketball court.\n\nLast season at Riverside, Skinner saw action at WR and RB for the Warriors. He hauled in 44 passes for 651 yards and 10 TDs, while also carrying the ball 68 times for 588 yards and 5 TDs.\n\nOn the court, Skinner helped lead the Warriors to a state title game appearance in the 2023 season. In the semifinal, he scored 11 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, and blocked 5 shots on his way to earning All-Region honors. Skinner also shows off his impressive speed on the track by clocking a 23.78 in the 200m dash.\n\nWhile playing at RB and WR in high school, Skinner projects as a TE going forward. His size (6-foot-3.5 and 220 pounds) and speed will help him create mismatches on LBs and safeties at the next level.\n\nToday's visit is a huge opportunity for the Gamecocks. Currently, Skinner is committed to play for the Cincinnati Bearcats and if South Carolina wants to earn his signature in December, they'll have to set themselves apart.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nYou can follow us for future coverage by clicking \"Follow\" on the top right-hand corner of the page.

Play now!\n\nSkinner added, \"It was more about going back into my own gym, just the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the [former team coordinator] M\u00e1rta [K\u00e1rolyi] era. And I'm not sticking up for M\u00e1rta or saying what she did was good, I'm just saying it was different.\"\n\nShe then apologized for her comments. \"So anyway, sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful. That is never my intention. And seriously, throughout the video, I was so pumped for the girls, and it was so fun watching trials and doing a live with everybody.\"\n\nIn another statement, shared with PEOPLE through a representative, Skinner said, \"I want to formally apologize to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials.\"\n\n\"It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work. Your hard work and dedication has paid off and I congratulate each and every one of you,\" she continued.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\n\"Upon reflection I was comparing the 'Marta Era' to the current era. I am coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under Marta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments. I take full responsibility for what I said and I deeply apologize,\" Skinner went on.\n\nThe athlete added, \"It is most important to me that the sport I love continue down the path of healing and ensures a positive environment for all.

In a now deleted video, she mentioned that the current team \"isn't what it used to be,\" and that they have \"no work ethic.\"\n\nShe tried to clear up her statements in an Instagram story where she said that her comments \"weren't necessarily about the current team because I love and support all the girls that made it,\" but fans weren't convinced. One YouTube user wrote under the above video: \"Nah, she meant what she said. We didn't misinterpret what she said. She has a history of talking like this.\"\n\nBiles had seemingly addressed McKayla's comments on Threads a few weeks prior to her legendary win: \"Not everyone needs a mic and a platform.\"\n\nBiles and many other gymnasts, including Lee, Carey, and Chiles, all blocked McKayla on social media platforms after her comments.\n\n\"I want to formally apologise to Team USA and to our gymnastic community for my comments during my recent YouTube episodes of the gymnastics Olympic trials. It was not my intention to offend or disrespect any of the athletes or to take away from their hard work,\" read Skinner's apology from July 6, but it doesn't look like team USA are ready to forgive and forget.\n\nAfter her gold-medal performance at the 2024 Olympics, Biles made sure those who had criticised her and her team in the past would surely regret it.\n\nHer caption was a direct response to McKayla's video, reading: \"Lack of talent, lazy, Olympic champions. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\" Simone knows how to bring the fire!\n\nThe comments section brought a lot of confusion when McKayla Maroney, another gymnastic icon wrote under the iconic image: \"It doesn't get more iconic than this... she f'd around and found out fr. Feels like I need to apologise just to redeem my first name.\"\n\nMany fans thought this was another McKayla Skinner apology, but just so you know, they are two different gymnasts with the same first name. Who knows? Maybe McKayla Skinner's comments gave Biles and her team that extra fuel to be the best they can be.\n\nBiles also came for the haters on her Instagram story today, after receiving backlash on her Olympic hairstyle. She took to her story to say: \"Gonna hold your hand when I say this \ud83d\udc8b next time you wanna comment on a black girls hair.

Credit - Tom Weller -- Getty Images\n\nSimone Biles took to social media to celebrate Team USA winning a gold medal in the women's gymnastics team final on Tuesday, posting a group picture of the team and their medals. But it was her caption that caught the most attention. Alongside the image, Biles wrote: \"Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions.\"\n\nThe caption was seemingly a pushback to comments claiming that the current U.S. women's team isn't as disciplined as previous ones. In a now-deleted YouTube video posted in early July, Biles' former Olympic teammate MyKayla Skinner said: \"Besides Simone, I feel like the talent and depth isn't what it used to be.\" She also said: \"The girls just don't have the work ethic... to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be, I feel like, a little aggressive and a little intense.\" Her comments came after the U.S. Olympic trials when Biles was named to the 2024 Olympic team, along with Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles, Sunisa Lee, and Hezly Rivera.\n\nSkinner competed with Biles on the 2020 team in Tokyo. With different rules in place during those Games, Skinner was allowed to compete as an individual athlete outside of the four official members of the U.S. team. When Biles withdrew from the team competition and the vault and floor finals due to the twisties, Skinner stepped in an earned a silver in the vault final.\n\nSkinner quickly apologized for her YouTube video in an Instagram story, saying: \"I feel like a lot of you guys had misinterpreted or misunderstood exactly what I was meaning or had said. Sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful.\"\n\nBiles clapped back to Skinner's initial video, posting on Threads on July 4. She didn't mention her former teammate by name, but said: \"Not everyone needs a mic.\"\n\nSkinner shared an additional apology on X (formerly Twitter) on July 6, addressing her words to \"Team USA and our gymnastics community.\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C-ESNIFIQ8l\n\nThe back and forth shines a spotlight on the seismic culture shift occurring in women's gymnastics in the U.S., after one of the largest sexual abuse scandals in sports exposed shortcomings in the system for failing to protect athletes and hold organizations such as USA Gymnastics accountable. Hundreds of gymnasts, including Biles, came forward with reports of sexual abuse by team doctor Larry Nassar, and investigations revealed USA Gymnastics officials had been alerted to complaints but failed to take appropriate actions, allowing Nassar to continue treating athletes on the national team for more than a decade.\n\nThe culture of not encouraging gymnasts to speak up out of fear of being left off of coveted international and Olympic teams contributed to the long-lasting abuse, gymnasts have said, and the strict system Skinner referred to, led by long-time national team coordinator Martha Karolyi, played a part in part to keeping athletes silent. \"I'm not sticking up for Martha or saying what she did was good, I'm just saying it was different,\" Skinner said in her apology\n\nBiles has catalyzed a change that culture, which many saw as toxic, and discouraged gymnasts from even smiling and appearing to enjoy themselves during competition. Her first coach told TIME before the Rio Olympics that Biles broke the mold in being lighthearted and expressing her personality at training camps and competitions, and she never discouraged her to do otherwise, since that was Biles' personality.\n\nIn Paris, following the women's gold medal performance, Biles addressed the culture shift that she helped to instigate, noting that \"Gymnasts -- they used to try to put us in a box. So if you weren't like this you weren't successful. When I came around nobody really talked or laughed and all that stuff [at training camps]. But I was like, that's not how I do gymnastics. So I'm going to continue to do the gymnastics that I know and love and the reason why I fell in love with the sport. Now we show off our personalities and really have fun, but know that once we get on the floor, we've put in the work and it shows in the results. And we don't have to be put in a box any more.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezly_Rivera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hezly Rivera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Carey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jade Carey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Chiles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Chiles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyKayla_Skinner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MyKayla Skinner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_women's_gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins women's gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States women's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_artistic_team_all-around", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic team all-around"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Nassar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Nassar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gymnastics/Artistic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1e01f7d76939e8747106d77487825a79", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777634", "eventUri": "eng-9777634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1891, "textEnd": 1897}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 2050, "textEnd": 2056}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 460136732, "relevance": 2}

Her comments received massive backlash and criticism, especially because after changes were purposely made in coaching and instructing due to a wide array of sexual abuse and misconduct that had been taking place for years.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, Skinner also purposely mispronounced USA gymnast Suni Lee's name AND MyKayla was also wrong with her facts.

The girls just don't have the work ethic.\"\n\nSkinner went on to claim that the U.S. Center for SafeSport, which works to prevent sexual, emotional and physical abuse against athletes, has had an effort on gymnast's training. \"Coaches can't get on athletes, which in some ways is really good, but at the same time, to get to where you need to be in gymnastics you do have to be ... a little aggressive, a little intense,\" she claimed.\n\nSkinner later apologized via her Instagram Story, stating that her words were \"misinterpreted\" and \"misunderstood.\" She explained: \"A lot of the stuff I was talking about wasn't always necessarily about the current team because I love and support all the girls that made it and I'm so proud of them.\"\n\nScroll down for five things to know about Skinner:\n\nBeginning gymnastics in 2000, Skinner went on to compete for the University of Utah's women's gymnastics team. During her collegiate career, she earned two NCAA championship titles in 2017 and 2018 and was a two-time NCAA all-around runner-up. She also set a NCAA record for consecutive routines without a fall at 161 performances, per the university's website.\n\nOutside of school, Skinner competed for the U.S. at the 2014 and 2019 World Championships. She scored gold in the team event in 2019 and 2014, as well as a personal bronze in the 2014 vault event.\n\nSkinner went on to act as an alternate at the 2016 Rio Games and later earned a spot on the U.S. women's gymnastics team for the 2020 Tokyo Games alongside Biles, Chiles, Suni Lee, Jade Carey and Grace McCallum. Skinner earned a silver medal in the vault event after Biles dropped out of the competition after experiencing the \"twisties.\"\n\nWhile apologizing for her July 2024 comments about the U.S. women's gymnastics Paris Olympics team, Skinner said that her words were \"more about going back into my own gym and the work ethic is different compared to when we were doing gymnastics in the M\u00e1rta [K\u00e1rolyi] era.\"\n\nK\u00e1rolyi formerly served as USA Gymnastics' national team coordinator and allegedly made athletes follow strict rules without objection, according to a 2018 Associated Press \u00e9xpos\u00e9.\n\n\"I'm not sticking up for M\u00e1rta or saying what she did was good,\" Skinner continued. \"I'm just saying it was different. So sorry for anything that got out of context or seemed hurtful; I love those girls and I'm seriously so happy for them so I would never do anything to make them feel otherwise.\"\n\nIn a follow-up apology, Skinner told Us Weekly that she was \"coming to terms that I have not fully dealt with the emotional and verbal abuse I endured under M\u00e1rta that perhaps led to my hurtful comments.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is most important to me that the sport I love continue down the path of healing and ensures a positive environment for all.\"\n\nBiles once again appeared to shade Skinner's comments after she and her teammates took home gold during the Paris Olympics women's gymnastics team competition in July 2024. \"Lack of talent, lazy, olympic champions \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\" she captioned Instagram pics of herself and Chiles, Carey, Lee and Hezly Rivera holding the American flag after their win.\n\nOlympian McKayla Maroney poked fun at the Skinner drama in the post's comments, writing, \"It doesn't get more iconic than this ... She f'd around n found out fr. Feels like I need to apologize just to redeem my first name.\"\n\nWithout directly addressing the backlash, Skinner congratulated the gymnasts on their victory via her Instagram Story. She captioned a photo of the group at their medal ceremony with three red heart emojis.\n\nSkinner tied the knot with American Ninja Warrior alum Jonas Harmer in 2019. \"And just like that ... Mr. & Mrs. Harmer\ud83d\udc8d,\" she captioned Instagram pics of their big day in November 2019.\n\nThe couple became parents with the birth of their daughter in September 2023. \"Everyone welcome Lottie!\" she wrote alongside hospital pics of herself and Harmer with their little one. \"Charlotte Jane Harmer made a safe arrival yesterday afternoon! Mom & baby are happy and healthy. We couldn't ask for more.\"", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paige_strout@usmagazine.com", "name": "Paige Strout", "type":
